Abstract: Herein we describe work that addresses issues of inter-agent communication skill acquisition by observation in a society of interacting agents. A bee-like society of agents is introduced (most adjacent to these experiments in ethological terms) and an architecture for enabling agents to acquire new skills (learn) by observation is proposed. The architecture is based on a combination of connectionist models, namely Kohonen self-organizing networks and back-propagation networks. A synthetic, movements-based robotic language is devised as a means of verifying the architecture. The architecture enables the agents to learn both how to understand and how to use, by generating new messages, a simple language that can be seen as the agents' symbol grounding of semantic knowledge. The tools used for implementing and testing this work included multiagent simulators and autonomous robotic vehicles as well as other specialized hardware like cameras and transputer boards for vision-based robot positioning.

Reference-contexts: Most of the time, these skills are gained by observing the behavior of the adult members of the social group [23]. When the new skill is a part of its behavioral set it should learn how to use it, and in which circumstances. This constitutes its social facilitation <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this way, the agents don't have to learn whole phrases each time, but can decompose the phrases into already known words and infer the meaning of single unknown words. This is the way Chomsky postulates human infants learn their mother language <ref> [2] </ref>. The architecture can be augmented in several ways to facilitate automatic generation of experts in the case of a more complex and/or evolving language.

Reference-contexts: In their architecture the learning vehicle used a rule-based system to correlate between significant events (ie turn in a maze) and corresponding action taken by the teaching vehicle. Dautenhahn <ref> [4] </ref> investigated ways in which robots could recognize others similar to them by keeping bodily contact and matching movements. She went on to investigate how movement patterns might be transferred from one robot to another. 3 Background 3.1 Learning Learning is more often a transfer of skills than a discovery.

Reference-contexts: The window information is subsequently passed to the tracker which assigns a sub-process to each robot; this subprocess "follows" the robot around as it moves. 7.2 Mobile Robots The robots are designed using the LEGO Technic system as basis, along with specialized electronics designed at the the University of Edinburgh <ref> [6] </ref>. 7.2.1 Robot Design The LEGO robots are quite small, comfortably fitting inside a cube with 35 cm sides. Only two wheels are used in the design and are placed near the center of each robot with the battery near their axis.

Reference-contexts: Finally the third processor, the Root chip, is responsible for the coordination of the system and for running the main tracking algorithms. An overview of the tracking system can be found in Figure 8. The tracking software was build upon an earlier system developed by Elliot <ref> [7] </ref> at the University of Edinburgh. It is enhanced with a multi-agent tracking capability, able to keep track of the positions of more than ten robots with an output frequency of at least 2Hz, and with a data logging system for later off-line processing.

Apart from social facilitation Galef in <ref> [8] </ref> presented a list of behaviors based on learning by observation: Contagious behavior describes situations in which the behavior of one animal triggers a similar behavior of another animal (for instance the flock formations of birds), whereas in matched dependent behavior the learner observes the reward of the demonstrator/teacher in a

Reference-contexts: They use various methods for distance measurement including the energy they consume during a particular journey. For navigation they use landmarks as well as the sky's brightness patterns (polarization) and the changes in the magnetic field of the earth <ref> [9] </ref>. As a means of communication among them bees use a special kind of movement called a "dance"; their scouts use this dance to inform other bees at the hive about a food source.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the expert sub-agents are trained on-line, while they observe the teacher. This training leads to the ability to understand and generate the language. 6.1 Kohonen Networks Overview The self-organizing topological maps were introduced by Kohonen <ref> [11] </ref> and use an unsupervised form of learning. In this type of networks the organization is not imposed by the programmer but is devised by the network itself and it is a function of the organization of the input data presented to the network.

Reference-contexts: sending information for its own sake, not as a side-effect of one of its actions, as opposed to indirect or stigmetric communication in which information is not transmitted on purpose by the transmitter but instead it is conceived by the unknown number of recipients as a change in their environment <ref> [13] </ref>. 2 In order for the agents to communicate a common ground, a language must exist among them. A language is independent of its means of transmission and it is not limited to phonemes (spoken) and characters (written).

Reference-contexts: A human observer determined whether the whole group of followers should be punished or rewarded for their actions. MacLennan <ref> [14] </ref> described a synthetic ethology system in which he studied the development of behaviors including communication. His creatures predict other creatures' situations by capturing and understanding broadcast messages from other creatures. The experiments he conducted showed an increased fitness for creatures that utilized this form of global communication.

Reference-contexts: Bees recognize their food sources (flowers) through their patterns and colors (both in the visible band and in the ultraviolet) and distinguish certain flowers from others using patterns visible only in the UV band <ref> [18] </ref>. They use various methods for distance measurement including the energy they consume during a particular journey. For navigation they use landmarks as well as the sky's brightness patterns (polarization) and the changes in the magnetic field of the earth [9]. <p> Interestingly different bee species have different notations for the distance. For example in some honeybees one 8-shape movement in the waggle dance denotes a 25 meter distance of the food source from the hive, whereas in African bees this distance is as much as 75 meters <ref> [18] </ref>. The round dance is the simplest form of dance and does not communicate exact distance or food source direction information. Rather, it informs the worker bees in the hive that a food source exists at close proximity (less than 15m).

Reference-contexts: As Galef points out, the examples of learning by observation reported in the ethological literature are legion and their classification into categories supported by the same learning mechanism (s) unknown. Mitchell <ref> [20] </ref> has given a comparative-developmental definition of imitation in terms of five hierarchical levels of competences an animal must possess; however, this is more a working framework to guide research than a complete explanation of mechanisms. 3.2 Communication and Language Our work focuses on creating a society of agents that exhibit

Reference-contexts: At the end node areas attract similar vectors, so areas can be labeled according to the vector type 6 they attract. This type of networks is quite popular among roboticists because it provides an easy way of autonomous agent learning without feedback. Nehmzow, Hallam and Smithers <ref> [21] </ref> introduced a project with Really Useful Robots that were capable of recognizing landmarks using self-organizing maps when presented with current sensor state and previous actions. 6.2 Kohonen Network Training The training procedure of the Kohonen self-organizing networks was the following: A simple modeler of the vehicles' characteristics was built that

Reference-contexts: Using the vibration dance the bees regulate their foraging patterns according to short and long term food availability [26].

Reference-contexts: One example of the use of inner-species communication through movement is that of bees. Honey bees (Apis Melifera) communicate via a number of different movements, grouped into dances, which have been extensively studied by ethologists during the 20th century, especialy Karl von Frisch <ref> [24] </ref>. Bees recognize their food sources (flowers) through their patterns and colors (both in the visible band and in the ultraviolet) and distinguish certain flowers from others using patterns visible only in the UV band [18]. <p> The language of the bees is adapted through evolution to suit their needs. For instance there is no word for "up" in the bee language as shown by <ref> [24] </ref> (since there are no flowers in the sky). 4 The Synthetic Language and Its Ac quisition The system proposed here enables the transfer of skills from one agent to others by observation. The system can facilitate both one to one and one to many agent learning.

Reference-contexts: The dance elements come to represent the location of food in a way reminiscent of the adaptational role they play in representing the presence of flowers to bees [3]. 2 Related Work Our work is related to that of Yanco and Stein <ref> [28, 27] </ref>, who devised a simple synthetic communication language and implemented it in a simulated and a real environment. The agents she used learned the language by a simple reinforcement learning algorithm; constant reinforcement, positive or negative was used. <p> On the other hand an agent-developed adaptive language while guaranteeing suitability has the worst learning curve <ref> [27] </ref>. Our exact implementation of the language was heavily influence by the design of the robots we used (turn radius, size, holonomic or not). 3.3 The Honey Bee (Apis Melifera) Many species use communication to maximize their survival chances. <p> An interesting experiment would be to continue the training of the networks during the actual experiments and train them to possible new shapes. 1 For instance, in the phrase "look at this", the word "this" can have a variety of meanings <ref> [27] </ref> 10 Summary and Conclusion This paper puts forward a framework within which communication skills can be transferred from one agent to another and presents experiments demonstrating how a robotic agent can learn a simple movements-based language by observing a teacher.

Reference-contexts: Second the world knowledge: in order for a language to be understood, it should describe a domain known to everyone. For example a visually impaired person could never understand the meaning of words describing colors in an unknown language <ref> [29] </ref>. In our case the world is known both to the recipient (learner) and to the transmitters of the language since they are situated. Finally the semantics: a language needs rules that will link the syntactical structures with the appropriate objects and relations in the world. <p> This language dialect will carry greater momentum than the other dialects and should be able to establish itself. Because the agents' world is inherently noisy and the agents' movements are limited by design factors a context dependent grammar might be proven useful. In state-based context dependency <ref> [29] </ref> (indexicality) the meaning of a word depends on the state of the world 1 . In this way an agent would need a smaller vocabulary of words to represent more concepts (internal representations).
