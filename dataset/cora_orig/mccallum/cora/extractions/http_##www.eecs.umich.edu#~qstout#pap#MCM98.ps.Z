Abstract: Economics is the principle driver of current trends to use commodity components in the construction of parallel systems for a range of sizes. One objective is to enable the user to purchase a small system initially, and then extend it through a range of sizes as needs dictate. A desirable feature is to have good system performance through the range of sizes; an undesirable feature is to require the user to purchase excess hardware that will not be used until the system is grown to its maximum allowable size. In this paper, we give a new construction which reconciles these two conflicting factors by introducing a way to interconnect several components of a given small network using only the routers for the small network, with one additional port per router. This construction, which we call shift-product, does not unduly raise the communication diameter of the resulting large network.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, in composing networks, one would like to maintain desirable network properties such as symmetry, low degree, diameter, scalability, and efficient mappings of algorithms and embeddings of certain classes of networks. The behavior of several of these properties under the direct product composition was studied in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.1 Direct Product Let G and H denote two graphs. <p> To route in ./ S k from node a 1 a 2 : : : a k to node b 1 b 2 : : : b k : (i) use the S routing to go from a 1 a 2 : : : a k to a <ref> [2] </ref> = b 2 a 2 : : : a k (ii) use a shift arc to move to a [3] = a 2 : : : a k b 2 (iii) use the S routing to move to a [4] = b 3 a 3 : : : a k

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, we will give examples where not all vertices of G appear as edge labels of H.

Reference-contexts: This would involve the use of "faulty" or "incomplete" systems. There have many numerous studies for both the mesh and the hypercube networks from this point of view. A more recent study involved using small meshes as basic building blocks to form larger incomplete meshes <ref> [10] </ref>. Such systems require significant changes to the basic building block and routing networks, in general.
