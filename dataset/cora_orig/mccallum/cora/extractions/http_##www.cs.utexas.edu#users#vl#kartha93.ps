Abstract: Instead of trying to compare methodologies for reasoning about action on the basis of specific examples, we focus here on a general class of problems, expressible in a declarative language A. We propose three translations, P; R and B from A, representing respectively the first order methods of reasoning about action proposed by Pednault and Reiter and the circumscriptive approach of Baker. We then prove the soundness and completeness of these translations relative to the semantics of A. This lets us compare these three methods in a mathematically precise fashion. Moreover, we apply the methods of Baker in a general setting and prove a theorem which shows that if the domain of interest can be expressed in A, circumscription yields results which are intuitively expected.

Reference-contexts: They also let us deal with incompletely specified initial situations. The technically most difficult part of this paper is the formalization based on circumscription. It is based on the following idea of Baker <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> : When the abnormality predicate Ab is circumscribed, the Result function and the situation constant corresponding to the initial situation, S 0 are allowed to vary. A theorem is proved which shows that the circumscription yields results which are intuitively expected. <p> A theorem is proved which shows that the circumscription yields results which are intuitively expected. This result shows how to apply the methods in <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> in a general setting. The theorem is proved in a fashion which makes it plausible that the methods of proof can be employed in other situations as well. In the next section, we describe the language A which is used to formalize the domain of actions. <p> We can easily prove a theorem of the same form as Theorem 2 for this scheme also. 5 Translation into Circumscriptive Scheme In this section we will propose a translation into a cir-cumscriptive scheme, based on the method of <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> and state again the soundness and completeness of the translation. <p> But this does not work, as noted by Hanks and McDermott in [ Hanks and McDermott, 1987 ] . A simple solution, proposed by Baker in <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> is to vary the function Result instead. For this method to work correctly, we need an "existence of situation" axiom, which intuitively says that, corresponding to any subset of fluents, there is a situation in which exactly these hold. <p> This can be formulated as follows: Let range over states, that is, subsets of the set of all fluents. Define St (s) = F 2 Holds (F; s) ^ ^ :Holds (F; s): Now, the existence of situations axiom can be written as ^ 9sSt (s): (15) Baker <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> suggests ways to write this axiom in a more compact form. 5.2 The Translation B (D) Let us first define an auxiliary translation T B (D) as a preliminary step before defining B (D). <p> F ^ a = A ^ affected F;A (s))] where affected F;A (s) = (precond + F;A (s) ^ :Holds (F; s))_ (precond F;A (s) ^ Holds (F; s)) Note that this lemma characterizes Ab completely. 6 Summary and Discussion In this paper, we have shown that the methods in <ref> [ Ped-nault, 1989; Reiter, 1991; Baker, 1991 ] </ref> are applicable to a large class of problems. These methods support reasoning forward as well as backward in time. We have also compared these methods in a mathematically precise fashion. <p> These methods support reasoning forward as well as backward in time.

Reference-contexts: We can now prove a theorem about R (D) exactly sim ilar to Theorem 1. Theorem 2 Let D be any finite, consistent domain and let R (D) be defined as before. For any v-proposition ff, R (D) j= R (ff) () D entails ff. In <ref> [ Elkan, 1992 ] </ref> , Elkan proposed a similar scheme for reasoning about action.

Reference-contexts: A, introduced in <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1992 ] </ref> . In that paper, the authors also define a translation from A into the language of extended logic programs and prove its soundness. <p> Section 4 presents a translation based on Reiter's approach. In Section 5, we provide a translation which uses the circumscriptive approach. Section 6 contains concluding remarks. The proofs of all the theorems are omitted. 2 The Language A In this section, we describe the languge A introduced in <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1992 ] </ref> . The reader who is interested in more examples and motivation is referred to that paper. Consider two disjoint nonempty sets of symbols, called fluent names and action names. A fluent expression is a fluent name possibly preceded by :. <p> Moreover, we have shown how to apply the methods in [ Baker, 1991 ] to reason about actions using circumscription, in a general setting. The results of this paper, in combination with the soundness theorem for the translation into logic programming from <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1992 ] </ref> , suggest that the computational mechanism of logic programming can be used for implementing the theories of action proposed by Ped-nault, Reiter and Baker. One major assumption we make is that the problem domain under consideration can be formalized in A. <p> One major assumption we make is that the problem domain under consideration can be formalized in A. As is pointed out in <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1992 ] </ref> , A is rather limited in its expressive power. For instance, we assume here that the fluents are all independent. This means that we are spared the task of coping with the "ramification problem" .

But this does not work, as noted by Hanks and McDermott in <ref> [ Hanks and McDermott, 1987 ] </ref> . A simple solution, proposed by Baker in [ Baker, 1991 ] is to vary the function Result instead.

The fluent names are Ontable and Inhand ; the action names are Putdown, Pickup, Lower and Wait.

Reference-contexts: For any v-proposition ff, B (D) j= B (ff) () D entails ff. Note that this theorem is of the same form as Theorems 1 and 2. Using this theorem, we can prove a "restricted monotonicity" result <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993 ] </ref> for Baker's approach to formalizing action. The proof of Theorem 3 is based on the following lemma about the result of circumscribing Ab. The Main Lemma Let D be a finite, consistent domain.

Reference-contexts: This result is of independent interest, since it shows that circumscription can handle reasoning about actions elegantly. 5.1 Review of Circumscription Circumscription was introduced by McCarthy <ref> [ Mc-Carthy, 1980; McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> as a formalism for non-monotonic reasoning. Intuitively, circumscribing a predicate in a sentence means assuming that the extent of the predicate is as small as possible. <p> The predicate Ab (f; a; s) intuitively means the following: f is abnormal with respect to a in situation s. Traditionally <ref> [ McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> , the formula B 0 consisting of the conjunction of the universal closures of all the domain axioms is circumscribed with respect to Ab while varying the predicate Holds.

Reference-contexts: Many problems which have been discussed extensively in the literature, such as the Yale shooting problem, are special cases of the formalization presented here. Thus, our work yields three classes of successful formalizations of wide applicability. Unlike other approaches like that in <ref> [ Shoham, 1988 ] </ref> , in addition to reasoning forward in time, the formalizations support reasoning backwards in time as well. They also let us deal with incompletely specified initial situations. The technically most difficult part of this paper is the formalization based on circumscription.
