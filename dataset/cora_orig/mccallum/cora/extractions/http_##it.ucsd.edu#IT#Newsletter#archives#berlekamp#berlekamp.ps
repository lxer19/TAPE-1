Title: 1993 Shannon Lecture  
Author: Elwyn Berlekamp 
Abstract: While preparing for this Shannon lecture, I tried to prepare a list of all the people in the IT Group to whom I feel indebted. That list soon grew so long that I could find no reasonable way to cut it off. At various times in the past 30 years, I've had the pleasure of getting to know and work with quite a few of you, and it's really been an awful lot of fun. We're all fortunate to be part of a dynamic intellectual community which has been able to formulate and solve a large number of interesting problems, and to support ourselves while doing so. I eventually decided to dedicate this talk to the person who first introduced me to serious research, to information theory, and coding, and to game theory. He was my first boss and mentor at Bell Labs, when I began work there as an undergraduate. His name was John L Kelly, Jr. After getting a PhD in mathematical physics from the University of Texas, John worked at Bell Labs for the rest of his life. He died of a heart attack in 1965 at the age of 41. Today, I've decided to skim the surface of 4 different topics, all of which were of interest to John Kelly. I'm hoping that this will maximize the chance that I'll touch at least one topic of interest to each of you. The paper for which John Kelly is most remembered today is better known in financial circles than in engineering ones. Although Kelly often chatted about this paper, much of what he said was well over my head at the time, and I never actually tried to READ this paper until after his death. Kelly originally entitled the paper INFORMATION THEORY AND GAMBLING. But some AT&T executives expressed concern that the press might misconstrue such a title as evidence that Bell Labs might be doing work on behalf of illegal bookies who were big customers of AT&T. So the paper appeared under the less colorful title. But Kelly fervently believed that gambling and investment differed only in one minus sign: Opportunities that offer FAVORABLE odds are called INVESTMENTS, but deals that involve
