Abstract: The range of PBD systems can be significantly expanded by improving the users expressiveness when communicating with the system. The techniques in my research include a new form of demonstrational interaction called nudges. Complementing nudges is a special form of selection which is used to give the system hints by identifying significant objects. A new deck-of-playing-cards metaphor is also introduced for specifying useful effects such as randomness and sequencing. The final techniques use objects for annotating examples such as behavior icons for manipulating and editing behaviors, and temporal ghosts to allow explicit references to past states. By fostering better communication between the author and the system, these techniques should allow the user with minimum programming expertise to create highly interactive software.

Reference-contexts: Hints are especially useful when the author performs a Stop That! nudge. Objects can be highlighted even if the reason for the hint will not be apparent until later. Maulsby studied hints in his thesis as well <ref> [2] </ref>, but Gamut will be the first to apply hints in an interactive domain. Deck of Cards An author will be able to use the deck of playing cards metaphor to specify a variety of effects.

Reference-contexts: For instance, a pieces legal moves may be relative to its current position. To allow the author to make explicit connections to the past, Gamut will show a dimmed, translucent image of the object in its prior state. A similar technique was used to record cursor positions in Marquise <ref> [3] </ref> so that the author could specify how objects behave with respect to cursor events. Timeline and Counting Sheet Views The author will be able to control the number of ghost objects as well as run the application back and forth in time with the timeline view.
