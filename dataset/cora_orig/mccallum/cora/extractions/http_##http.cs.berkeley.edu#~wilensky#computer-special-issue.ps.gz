Abstract: We are engaged in developing technologies to support work-centered digital information services. Work-centered digital information services are a set of library-like services meant to address the mission of the work group. Workplace users have somewhat specialized needs. In particular, they have internal collections of "legacy" document that need to be accessed along with external collections; they frequently want to retrieve information, rather than documents per se; and they require that digital information systems be integrated into, as well as augment, established work practices. Realizing work-centered digital information systems requires a broad technical agenda: Document image analysis, natural language analysis, computer vision analysis are necessary to facilitate information extraction; new user interface paradigms and authoring tools are required for users to better access multimedia information; improved protocols are required for client programs to interact with repositories. Moreover, new concepts of documents must be developed to exploit these capabilities. Our system follows a client-server architecture, in which the servers are repositories implemented as data bases supporting user-defined functions and user-defined access methods, and also serving as indexing servers. Various protocols are stipulated for these repositories to communicate with clients. A number of interoperating clients serve as browsers for different document data types and facilitate access to such types. To help develop the appropriate technologies for this problem, we are creating a prototype set of information services which we call the "California Environmental Digital Information System". This testbed includes a large collection of diverse kinds of data about the environment. We have also brought together a consortium of data providers and data users. It is our intention that our services will become a national resource, and that our prototype will serve as the basis for a full-scale, state-wide environmental information system.

Reference-contexts: Our architecture philosophy is also evident in the interfaces to our document collection. The scanned documents, including optical character recognition (OCR) of the images, are stored in a modified version of Cornell's Dienst server <ref> (Davis and Lagoze, 1994) </ref>. This server allows users to search for and access document by their various attributes, and then browse their page images. <p> Specifically, we are attempting to do the following: * Provide a TileBars-style interface to the text. * Perform automatic categorization on text. * Provide an automated text geo-location facility. We have implemented a TileBars interface to our document collection. TileBars were introduced by Hearst <ref> (1994) </ref> in the context of "TexTiles", i.e., meaningful, automatically computed, multi-paragraph, topically coherent text segments. <p> A user-interface for such a navigation method is being devised. We mentioned above how geographic location is an important way to access our information. In the case of text, we have developed a system, called GIPSY <ref> (Woodruff and Plaunt, 1994) </ref> that hypothesizes the geographic regions to which the document pertains. <p> The resulting templates were used to decode 375 pages of tables in the document. Depending on which language 10 model we use for the document, the error rate for this approach shows an improvement by a factor of 7 to 20. Following the approach introduced in Kopec and Chou <ref> (1994) </ref>, we have been developing document-specific decoders for documents identified by the DWR users as being of high value. In particular, we have written decoders for two bulletins. The analysis produced by the decoders recognizes the structure of these documents, which can be exploited in a variety of ways.

Reference-contexts: will continue to evolve over the duration of the project, with much of the work being both bottom-up (users telling us what they need and what they like) and top-down (us showing users what might be possible.) Our user needs assessment work is described in more detail in Van House <ref> (1995) </ref>. 4 Architecture The overall architecture of the system we are evolving is quite simple, consisting of the following basic elements: 5 * Repositories: There are any number of repositories, or information servers. Each reposi-tory is implemented as a data base that supports user-defined functions and user-defined access methods. <p> We are experimenting with various distributed search techniques for multiple repository searching. * Interoperability: There are several forms of interoperability with which we are experimenting. One is repository-level interoperability, in which we are attempting to provide low-level access to our collection as proposed in Kahn and Wilensky <ref> (1995) </ref>. At a higher level, we are attempting to perform schema-level interoperability, in which we cross-apply our clients and repositories to those of another project. For these two interoperability experiments, we are working with Project Alexandria at UCSB. <p> Because of its widespread use, HTTP is primary among these. However, some clients communicate directly to the repositories in SQL. We are also designing our own protocol, "ZQL". In addition, we plan to implement the Repository Access Protocol as described in Kahn and Wilensky <ref> (1995) </ref>. To better understand the model to which we aspire, it is useful to examine our client/server proposal more carefully. We have a number of different types of documents, including traditional documents, images, and map-oriented data. <p> Consider for example Cypress, a client which provides access to our ground photographs. Cypress was derived from Chabot <ref> (Ogle and Stonebraker, 1995) </ref>, which used a custom tcl/tk client and a Postgres data base back-end. Like Chabot, in Cypress, the photos contain textual captures and other meta-data, as alluded to above. In addition, at data acquisition time, various image analysis processes are run and derived data computed. <p> Eventually, we plan to run textiling on our corpus, and extend the interface to map textile boundaries on top of the other document representations. To perform automatic categorization, we are developing further the topic assignment techniques we began in Fisher <ref> (1995) </ref>. In that effort, we used a thesaurus automatically constructed from Wordnet to define the constituent categories. Since then, we have improved our algorithms somewhat, and also (thanks to HarperCollins) obtained an on-line copy of Roget's International Thesaurus, Fifth Edition.
