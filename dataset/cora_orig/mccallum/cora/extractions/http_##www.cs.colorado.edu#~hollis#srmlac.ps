Reference-contexts: Introduction The Software Release Management tool (SRM) is an application that is designed to aide software developers and users in the software release process. This tool was developed by van der Hoek, Hall, Heimbigner and Wolf <ref> [1] </ref>. Using the Software Release Management tool, a software user can retrieve complex software systems via the internet. Allowing users to retrieve software over the internet, however, does evoke some concern [2].

Reference-contexts: This tool was developed by van der Hoek, Hall, Heimbigner and Wolf [1]. Using the Software Release Management tool, a software user can retrieve complex software systems via the internet. Allowing users to retrieve software over the internet, however, does evoke some concern <ref> [2] </ref>. By introducing an access control layer into the SRM retrieval process, one can limit the possibility of uninvited software retrieval and usage. Access control can be used to authenticate a user and verify authorization to retrieve the requested software package.

Reference-contexts: Access control can be used to authenticate a user and verify authorization to retrieve the requested software package. A licensing layer provides a means to display a shrinkwrap license agreement prior to software retrieval <ref> [3] </ref>. The shrinkwrap license agreement is widely relied upon for mass market distribution of software.

Reference-contexts: The intent of this paper is to walk the reader through the Software Development Process <ref> [4] </ref> that was used to develop the licensing and access control enhancements. The first step is to establish the requirements that are needed for SRMs access control and licensing system. After these requirements have been established, it is time to step back and analyze the problem.

Reference-contexts: A system administrator will then need to email the new users UserId and Password. Page 6 Analysis Object Diagrams With the help of the Grady Booch methodology <ref> [5] </ref>, I drew a set of object relationship diagrams that include each of these entities. Even though I will not be implementing the SRM improvements in an objectoriented programming language, I still find value in using objectoriented analysis techniques.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is more intuitive to have the System Release tools appear above the Group tools. design shown in Figure 7. Some of the widget highlighting could not be accomplished due to the limitations of the Tcl/Tk programming language <ref> [6] </ref>. The design also omitted the entry for a Group Header. Input for a header is needed to be consistent with the original SRM Create Group function.

Reference-contexts: There is no way for the Netscape Login Mechanism to examine all of the Access Control systems within a retrieve hierarchy. The alternative was to create the Access Control Web Page shown in Figure 33. Because the Access Control Web Page uses cgi-bin script <ref> [7] </ref> for its generation, it has the ability to check all of the Access Control systems in advance. This look ahead capability is needed when a user is trying to retrieve a hierarchy of Software Systems.
