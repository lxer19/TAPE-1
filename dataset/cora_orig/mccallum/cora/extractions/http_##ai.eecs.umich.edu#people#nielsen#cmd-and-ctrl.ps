Reference-contexts: In military parlance this is commonly referred to as command, control, communications, and intelligence (C 3 I ). This paper discusses our current state of development of intelligent, realistic C 3 I agents for simulation in the air domain. These agents have been implemented using ModSAF <ref> (Calder et al., 1993) </ref> and the Soar/ModSAF interface (Schwamb et al., 1994). The remainder of this introductory section provides an overview of the C 3 I domain and some motivation for this work. Section 3 has a description of the C 3 I agents implemented by this project to date.

Reference-contexts: IFORs must have many capabilities to be successful including: extensive knowledge, real-time reactivity, goal-directed problem solving, and planning. Additionally, they must coordinate their activities with other friendly forces <ref> (Laird et al., 1995a) </ref>. To fully support very large scale battle field simulations, such as those envisioned for STOW-97, intelligent computer generated forces cannot act independently; but rather, they must coordinate their efforts for increased effect just as humans do.

Reference-contexts: In 1994, the Soar/IFOR project was tasked to provide automated pilots for all air vehicles and mis sions in support of STOW-97. (See <ref> (Laird et al., 1995b) </ref> for an overview of the current state of this project.) In order to accomplish this task we needed to extend the scope of the project to include those interactions necessary between pilots and controllers, even if they are not airborne.

Reference-contexts: More work needs to be done on natural language understand both for agent flexibility and ease of use in human computer interaction See <ref> (Lehman et al., 1995) </ref> for recent work. Though these agents were prepared to take part in the STOW-E demonstration, during rehearsal they were unable to handle the large number of other agents they saw in the world and crashed.

Reference-contexts: During each decision cycle all relevant rules are tested and allowed to fire in parallel. Thus the sequence of execution is not fixed. The real-time is requirement handled by making the speed of operator execution comparable to experimental results in humans <ref> (Newell, 1990) </ref>. Since this can only guarantee soft real-time, our agents will react quickly, but may fail to react quickly enough when faced with overly complex situations, just as people do. Limiting the number of available choices increases the speed of decision making.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 discusses research and open problems. Finally, section 7 provides general discussion and conclusions. 2.1. Domain Overview Previous work in computer generated forces has either focused on individual agents working in relative isolation or groups of agents which may be treated as a whole <ref> (Rao et al., 1994) </ref>. A notable exception is (Ballas et al., in press). These approaches avoid the problems of C 3 I by allowing human guidance, but when the agents number in the tens of thousands, finding enough people to control them is infeasible.

Reference-contexts: This makes it easier to understand the behavior of the IFOR commanders, and allows human communication with the IFOR commanders. In order to communicate with other CGFs we will be adopting CCSIL pro tocols <ref> (Salisbury, 1995) </ref>. 4.4. Intelligence The most important responsibility of an air controller is to locate, identify, and track threats. "Timely interception is totally dependent of two factors: early detection and positive identification"(Gunston & Spick, 1983). The need to track the threat arises because enemy agents are eminently uncooperative.
