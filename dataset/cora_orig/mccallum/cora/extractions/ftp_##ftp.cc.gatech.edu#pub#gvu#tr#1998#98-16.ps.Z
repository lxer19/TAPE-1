Abstract: Media space applications that promote informal awareness in an organization confront an inevitable paradox: the shared video connections between offices and rooms that promote informal awareness also can rob individuals of privacy. An important open problem in this area is how to foster awareness of colleagues without the accompanying loss of privacy. One proposal put forward is to filter the communicated video streams rather than broadcasting clear video. In this article, we describe several image-filtering techniques that may provide awareness in informal group communication applications while blurring the details of an individuals activities, thus potentially preserving more privacy. We describe experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the degrees of awareness and accuracy that these filtering techniques provide.

Reference-contexts: So perhaps the individual should be allowed to select the level of information about him or her being transmitted. Several techniques have been proposed to preserve privacy while providing presence to remote users. One of the proposed solutions is to use abstract, iconic representations of users instead of video <ref> [1, 6, 13] </ref>. However, it is still debatable whether sacrificing the relatively richer contextual information in video images is necessary [10]. Another idea is to transmit modified video data instead of raw video at low frame rates.

Use of the Portholes system <ref> [3] </ref> showed that in a media space environment, people often are interested in other peoples presence, availability, and interruptability. This kind of information can sometimes be inferred from seemingly unsubstantial artifacts in the environment.

Reference-contexts: A pixel is likely to be on an edge if at that location, the maximum rate of intensity change per unit distance in all directions is great. A simple way to compute an approximation of edges in an image is to apply the Sobel operators to the original image <ref> [5] </ref>. Shadow-View Filter and its Variation The shadow-view filter [7] assumes that the camera position and orientation do not change. <p> Global illumination changes, occurring for example when a light is turned on, can cause false motions in the images. One solution is to preprocess each image with a blur filter then followed by a histogram equalization filter <ref> [5] </ref> to lessen the effect of lighting change.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, the level of awareness perceived is no more detailed than what is needed to encourage informal communication.

A blur filter usually refers to a process that averages neighboring pixels in an image to produce a new, blurry image. Repeated applications of a blur filter produce incrementally blurrier images.
