Abstract: In part (I) of this paper, it is proved that there are no limit points for the set of values of average genus of 2-connected simplicial graphs and of 3-connected graphs. The need for such restrictions is now demonstrated by showing that infinitely many real numbers are limit points of values of average genus for 2-connected non-simplicial graphs. A systematic method for constructing such limit points is presented, and it is proved that this method is essentially the only way to construct limit points of values of average genus for "homeomorphically nested" 2-connected graphs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In part (I) of this paper <ref> [ChGr 1990c] </ref>, we have examined the values of average genus for 2-connected simplicial graphs and for 3-connected graphs. <p> is in the Gross-Furst hierarchy [GrFu 1987] and studied by Gross, Klein and Rieper [GrKlRi 1989]. (Stahl [Stahl 1983] studied the related problem of average genus of a class of graphs with the same number of edges.) The proof for the following theorem can be found in Chen and Gross <ref> [ChGr 1990c] </ref>. Theorem 1.1 The average genus of a graph is not less than the average genus of any of its subgraphs. <p> Corollary 2.3 fl avg (L n ) n=3 We also give the results of calculations of average genus for two special classes of graphs. These results will be used later. The proofs of these results can be found in Chen and Gross <ref> [ChGr 1990c, Lemmas 5.5 and 5.6] </ref>. We recall that a graph with two vertices and n edges adjoining them is called a dipole and is denoted D n . Also, a graph with one vertex and n self-loops is called a bouquet and is denoted B n . <p> The average genus of a graph can be estimated by sampling. By our results in part (I) of this paper <ref> [ChGr 1990c] </ref>, at least for 2-connected simplicial graphs and for 3-connected graphs, two non-homeomorphic graphs have a negligible chance to share the same real number as their average genus.

Schwenk and White 4 [ScWh 1990] (see also Lee and White [LeWh 1990]) computed the average genus of closed-end ladders from that formula. The present proof computes the average genus of closed-end ladders directly, without recourse to the formula. <p> The present proof computes the average genus of closed-end ladders directly, without recourse to the formula. Indeed, our technique here, with a minor modification, gives us a new method, different from that of Furst, Gross, and Statman <ref> [FuGrSt 1989] </ref>, to derive the genus distributions of closed-end ladders. Lemma 2.1 Let L n be the closed-end ladder of n rungs and let e be an end-rung of L n .

The proof for the following theorem can be found in Chen and Gross [ChGr 1990c]. <p> A necklace of type (d; s) is the necklace N (d;0) of type (d; 0) plus s self-loops added to s distinct interior points of those non-multiple edges of N (d;0) (in an arbitrary way). These necklaces were developed by Klein (see <ref> [GrKlRi 1989] </ref>). The graphs in Figure 1 are two necklaces of type (4; 3). Although there is a unique necklace of type (d; 0) up to homeomorphism, there are more than one non-homeomorphic necklaces of type (d; s) for d &gt; 1 and s &gt; 1. <p> Although there is a unique necklace of type (d; 0) up to homeomorphism, there are more than one non-homeomorphic necklaces of type (d; s) for d &gt; 1 and s &gt; 1.

In a necklace, the basic simple cycle serves as a "frame" and all other edges are just ears serially attached to the frame.

We slightly modify the terminology used in <ref> [Tutte 1984] </ref>. Let H be a subgraph of a connected graph G. Denote by G H the graph obtained from G by first deleting all edges in H and then deleting all the isolated vertices. <p> If a vertex v belongs to two distinct bridges of G H, then v must be an attachment of the subgraph H in G. These follow directly from the definitions. For further discussion of bridges and attachments, see Tutte <ref> [Tutte 1984] </ref>. We will also investigate some special properties of bridges and attachments of 2-connected graphs below. A graph is called smooth if it does not contain 2-valent vertices.
