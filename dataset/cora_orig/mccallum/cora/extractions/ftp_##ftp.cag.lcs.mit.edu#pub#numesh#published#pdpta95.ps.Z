Abstract: The NuMesh system defines a high-speed communication substrate optimized for off-line routing. By determining possible communication paths at compile time, highly efficient hardware and software constructs can be exploited to yield superior network performance. Limited gate delays between NuMesh registers, as well as single cycle message transfers, allow for a high clock frequency and low network latency. A highly pipelined architecture for this communication is presented and a mechanism for efficient ow control communication is discussed. A unique communication protocol is presented and shown to provide single cycle transfers between nodes. Virtual pipes are discussed as a communication protocol for nodes to communicate when running applications on the NuMesh system. Preliminary results and a description of the current hardware and software status are listed.
