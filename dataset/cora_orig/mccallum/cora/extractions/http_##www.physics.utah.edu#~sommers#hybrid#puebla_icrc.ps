Abstract: We have analyzed the resolution of the Hi-Res optical design of the fluorescence detector observatory. We have found a heterogeneous image resolution from one degree to four degrees depending on the field of view. We propose to use a lensless Schmidt camera (with spherical image surface) to duplicate the field of view to 30x30 degrees and simultaneously guarantee a resolution of one degree over of the whole field of view. To test this proposal, we constructed a 1/10 scaled Schmidt camera prototype. Finally we have analyzed flattening the image surface and we found that it is possible to use a flat or segmented flat surface in which cases the image quality is guaranteed too.
