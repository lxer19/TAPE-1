Abstract: This paper presents a technique to determine the identity of objects in a scene using histograms of the responses of a vector of local linear neighborhood operators (receptive fields). This technique can be used to determine the most probable objects in a scene, independent of the object's position, image-plane orientation and scale. In this paper we describe the mathematical foundations of the technique and present the results of experiments which compare robustness and recognition rates for different local neighborhood operators and histogram similarity meas urements.

Reference-contexts: A Gabor filter pair is compact in both space and frequency. In our experiments we have used a two-dimensional formulation of the Gabor functions proposed by Daugman <ref> [1] </ref> (in the Fourier domain): G (u; v) = e ( (uu 0 ) 2 ff 2 +(vv 0 ) 2 fi 2 ) e 2i (x 0 (uu 0 )+y 0 (vv 0 )) (2) where (x 0 ; y 0 ) are the center coordinates of the filter, (ff;

Reference-contexts: Several authors have improved the performance of the color histogram approach by introducing measures which are less sensitive to illumination changes (see i.e. <ref> [5, 6, 2] </ref>). The color histogram approach is an attractive method for object recognition, because of its simplicity, speed and robustness. However, its reliance on object color and (to a lesser degree) light source intensity make it inappropriate for many recognition problems.

Reference-contexts: The comparison measurement determines the separability between histograms, as we will see in the experiments described below. Different measures for the histogram comparison are introduced in section 4. The design parameters of the histograms determine the separability between the histograms of different objects. In <ref> [8] </ref> we concluded that reducing of the resolution (number of bins per histogram axis) results in an improvement of the stability of the histograms with respect to view point changes, but also diminishes the discrimination between objects.

From the experiments of [8] we concluded also that discrimination can be recovered by improving the number of histograms dimensions provided by independent local properties. 3 The local characteristics In this section we briefly describe receptive field functions which can be used for object recognition. <p> This is followed by the description of two equivariant filter classes, Gabor filters and Gaussian derivatives. 1 Recent results have shown that the technique is quite robust to 3D rotation. These results have been submitted to the International Workshop on Object Representation for Computer Vision at this conference <ref> [8] </ref> Gradient and Laplacian Operators Our first experiments were performed with first derivative and Laplacian operators given by: M dx = @ 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 A M lap = @ 2 12 2 1 Gabor filter Gabor filters are local compact filters tuned <p> The impact on the histograms (measured with an appropriate distance measure) are shown in section 5. In this article we do not consider the other degrees of freedom mentioned above: 3D rotation and light direction. In <ref> [8] </ref> we examined the robustness of the approach to image-plane rotation and view point changes (3D-rotation). Application for Object Recognition The system we describe here is only an initial experiment to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach for object recognition. <p> In this experiment we varied the local properties and the histogram comparison measurement The design parameter of the histograms have been fixed (2-dimensional with resolution of 32 cells per axis, for variation of the design parameters see <ref> [8] </ref>). For local properties, we used the same pairs of filters as in section 5. All experiments were performed with only two filters, as a minimal limiting case (in [8] we showed that recognition rates can be improved by increasing the number of local properties measured at each pixel). <p> of the histograms have been fixed (2-dimensional with resolution of 32 cells per axis, for variation of the design parameters see <ref> [8] </ref>).

All experiments were performed with only two filters, as a minimal limiting case (in [8] we showed that recognition rates can be improved by increasing the number of local properties measured at each pixel). Table 1 shows the recognition rate for different filter-pairs and different histogram comparison measurements. The first column of table 1 shows the filter-pairs. <p> Nevertheless the average performance over all of the filter pairs is not satisfactory. To summarize the table we can conclude that the 2 are the best, followed by SSD and intersection. In other experiments (e.g. section 7.3, 7.2 and <ref> [8] </ref>), we did make similar observation in relation to the histogram comparison measurements. <p> Our experiments have also demonstrated that the 2 test provides the most reliable form of histogram comparison for this method. Relatively high recognition rates have been demonstrated with vectors composed of only two receptive field. We showed in <ref> [8] </ref> that these rates can be made even higher by increasing the number of filters included in the vector. The increase in memory required can be off-set by decreasing the quantization of the histograms.

Reference-contexts: Bayes Rule The last section below considers the use of Bayes rule to determine for each pixel or set of pixels, the probability that it is the projection of a part of a specified object. In <ref> [9] </ref> we have introduced the following formula: p (O n j k Q P Q (7) with p (O n ) the a priori probability of the object O n , and p (M k jO n ) is the probability density function of object O n , which can be <p> This formula can be used to determine for each subregion of an image the probability of the occurrence of each object O n only based on the multidimensional receptive field histograms of each object (see for details and recognition results <ref> [9] </ref>). 5 Robustness to additive Gaussian noise In this section we report the results of an experiment which was designed to determine how sensitive the different combinations of filter and normalization are in respect to additive Gaussian noise. For this experiment we used 8 artificial images.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Motivation Swain and Ballard <ref> [10] </ref> have developed a technique which identifies objects in an image by matching a color histogram from a region of the image with a color histogram from a sample of the object. <p> The analysis of these measurements is important, since the "intersection"-measurement, used by Swain and Ballard <ref> [10] </ref>, has limitations for the use for multidimensional receptive field histograms. For object recognition using receptive field histograms we compare a histogram T from a database to a newly observed histogram H. <p> For the moment it is not clear which of the two 2 measurements is more reliable: 2 (H (i; j) T (i; j)) 2 (5) Intersection Swain and Ballard <ref> [10] </ref> used the following intersection value to compare two color-histograms: "(H; T ) = i;j min (H (i; j); T (i; j)) (6) The advantage of this measurement is, that background pixels are explicitly neglected when they don't occur in the Model histogram T (i; j). <p> The histograms themselves are invariant with respect to translation of the image or the object, since position information is completely removed. Furthermore the histogram matching is relatively immune to minor occlusions. This was demonstrated by Swain and Ballard in the original work on color histograms <ref> [10] </ref>. Signal intensity variations are accommodated by the use of energy normalized convolution with robust filters such as Gabor filters. For simplicity, our first experiments were based on simple mask operators as introduced in section 3 which are not necessarily invariant to light intensity changes.

Reference-contexts: To design a Gabor filter, we follow a method proposed by Westelius <ref> [11] </ref> to choose the standard deviation ff and the spatial frequency ! 0 . These two parameters determine the size and bandwidth of the filter. Gaussian derivatives By using the Gaussian derivatives one can explicitly se lect the scale. This is achieved by adapting the variance of the derivative.
