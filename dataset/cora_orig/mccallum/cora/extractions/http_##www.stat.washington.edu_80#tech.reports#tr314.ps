Abstract: Technical Report No. 314 Department of Statistics Box 354322 University of Washington Seattle, WA 98195-4322 USA Abstract We combine image-processing techniques with a powerful new statistical methodology to test for and find the location of linear production faults in woven textiles. Our approach detects an alignment pattern in preprocessed images via model-based clustering and uses an approximate Bayes factor to assess the evidence for the presence of a defect. Results are shown for some representative examples, and the associated software has been made available on the

Reference-contexts: However, if there are several flaws, perhaps intersecting one another, a more explicit incorporation of linearity might be advantageous. We now indicate briefly how this can be done. In model-based clustering, the covariance matrix associated with a cluster is parametrized <ref> (Banfield and Raftery, 1993) </ref> as = DAD T where: is the largest eigenvalue of , D is the matrix of eigenvectors, and A = diagf1; ffg.

Reference-contexts: In this work, we are interested only in letting the data determine the best value for A which amounts to determining the best value for ff. Murtagh and Raftery <ref> (1984) </ref> assumed user 5 specification of ff. A maximum likelihood estimate of the clusters (using EM) may additionally be used automatically to determine an optimal value of ff in the following way. <p> This results in a likelihood equation which reduces to the following simple expression for the estimate of ff: ^ff = ! 2 =! 1 i.e. the ration of eigenvalues (Dasgupta and Raftery, 1995). This reinforces the approach of Murtagh and Raftery <ref> (1984) </ref> by casting this problem in a likelihood framework. 3 Sample Processing of Two Images Figs. 2 and 3 show the images used.

Reference-contexts: Usually the two phases are carried out separately, often by different organizations. Each phase in turn is made up of sub-phases, between which there are opportunities for inspection. Using the terminology of Newman and Jain <ref> (1995) </ref> we distinguish between process inspection, and (end) product inspection. Our interest is in the problem of product inspection after fabric manufacturing, before final assembly. Fabric is produced by looms in two-meter wide rolls at a rate of about 10 mm per second. <p> The torn thread `splurges' can be detected through thresholding and size of the contiguous area. The more difficult case of faint aligned flaws will be investigated in this article. Previous work on this data has included Campbell et al. <ref> (1995) </ref> which used discrete Fourier transform texture descriptors (the amplitude spectrum) in 32 fi 32 subimage windows to provide input to a trainable classifier system. The next section reviews the basis for the statistical cluster-finding and testing method. <p> For a general review of Bayes factors, their use in applied statistics, and how to approximate and compute them, see Kass and Raftery <ref> (1995) </ref>. We approximate the Bayes factor using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz 1978). <p> Conventionally, BIC values between 0 and 2 correspond to weak evidence, values between 2 and 6 correspond to positive evidence, values between 6 and 10 correspond to strong evidence, and values greater than 10 correspond to very strong evidence <ref> (Kass and Raftery 1995) </ref>. In the present context of mixture models, the regularity conditions underlying the derivation of the BIC approximation to the Bayes factor do not hold (e.g. Titterington, Smith and Makov 1985). <p> This results in a likelihood equation which reduces to the following simple expression for the estimate of ff: ^ff = ! 2 =! 1 i.e. the ration of eigenvalues <ref> (Dasgupta and Raftery, 1995) </ref>. This reinforces the approach of Murtagh and Raftery (1984) by casting this problem in a likelihood framework. 3 Sample Processing of Two Images Figs. 2 and 3 show the images used.
