Abstract: We prove tight lower bounds, of up to n * , for the monotone depth of functions in monotone-P. As a result we achieve the separation of the following classes. 3. More generally: For any integer function D(n), up to n * (for some * &gt; 0), we give an explicit example of a monotone Boolean function, that can be computed by polynomial size monotone Boolean circuits of depth D(n), but that cannot be computed by any (fan-in 2) monotone Boolean circuits of depth less than ConstD(n) (for some constant Const). Our argument is more general: we define a new class of communication complexity search problems, referred to below as DART games, and we prove a tight lower bound for the communication complexity of every member of this class. As a result we get lower bounds for the monotone depth of many functions. In particular, we get the following bounds: 1. For st-connectivity, we get a tight lower bound of (log 2 n). That is, we get a new

Reference-contexts: Using Razborov's technique, exponential lower bounds for the monotone size of other functions were proved by Andreev [An85], and an exponential lower bound for the monotone size of the Clique function was finally proved by Alon and Boppana <ref> [AlBo87] </ref>. A simpler proof for that lower bound was recently presented by Haken [Ha95]. Those lower bounds, and other lower bounds for the monotone size of functions, immediately translate into corresponding lower bounds (of up to n * ) for the monotone depth of the same functions. <p> Here we prove that for k n * (for some small constant * &gt; 0), the monotone depth of k-clique is (k log n). Obviously, this lower bound is tight. This lower bound was previously known for k log n <ref> [AlBo87] </ref>. For m; k, define the communication game CLQ (m; k) to be the following DART (k1) (m; k) game: The input for Player I is (x i ) 1ik , and for Player II (y i ) 1ik .

Reference-contexts: Indeed, determining the monotone size (or depth) of a function is a very natural combinatorial problem, and monotone complexity may be relevant for several other complexity issues.

In particular, using techniques developed in the sequence of papers [ImPiUr94, BoPiRa95, Kr95], Pudlak [Pu95] used monotone complexity to obtain an impressive exponential lower bound for the length of cutting planes proofs (see also, [CoHa95, Fu96]). <p> One important example is propositional proof theory, where following 3 [Ra94] and Bonet et. al [BoPiRa95], reductions to monotone complexity were ex-tensively used.

Reference-contexts: Hence, in order to achieve a separation of classes of monotone depth, one needs to prove depth lower bounds directly, and not as a consequence of size lower bounds. In 1988, Karchmer and Wigderson <ref> [KaWi88] </ref> obtained the important result that the monotone depth of the st-connectivity function is (log 2 n). Since st-connectivity is in monotone-NC 2 , the separation of monotone-NC 1 from monotone-NC 2 was obtained. <p> Since the result of [Ra85a], many papers on monotone complexity have appeared, and this includes many interesting papers in the last 3 years (e.g., [Ya94, GoHa95, Ha95, AmMa96, BeUl97, SiTs97, Ju97]). Is monotone complexity research useful ? Although the separation results of [Ra85a], and <ref> [KaWi88] </ref>, are among the most famous and most impressive results in complexity theory, it is still under debate whether monotone complexity is worth pursuing. Indeed, by the results of [Ra85b, Ta88], the monotone size of a function may be exponentially larger than its non-monotone size. <p> Other applications of monotone complexity are also known. 1.2 Methods and Other Results We use Karchmer and Wigderson's communication complexity approach <ref> [KaWi88] </ref> (see also [Ka88]). In this approach, a lower bound for the monotone depth of a function f is obtained by proving a lower bound for the complexity of the following communication game: Player I is given an input x, such that f (x) = 1. <p> Below, we will refer to that game as the monotone KW-game for the function f . 7 The following observation was discovered by Yannakakis (unpublished), and by Karchmer and Wigderson who realized its full potential. (Here we only need the monotone form) : Lemma 3.1 <ref> [KaWi88] </ref> CC (R f ) is equal to the monotone depth of f . 3.1 The GEN Function The first insights leading to our separation results came from choosing a convenient function capturing the difficulty of the class monotone-P. <p> Corollary 3.12 For every i 0, monotone-NC i 6= monotone-NC i+1 . 14 4 Other Applications In this section, we prove other applications of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2: 4.1 Lower Bound for st-Connectivity As mentioned above, a tight lower bound of (log 2 n) was proved for st-connectivity in <ref> [KaWi88] </ref>. Here we show how to obtain that lower bound as an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.1. The proof, moreover, is different from the one given in [KaWi88]. <p> Theorem 2.2: 4.1 Lower Bound for st-Connectivity As mentioned above, a tight lower bound of (log 2 n) was proved for st-connectivity in <ref> [KaWi88] </ref>.

For m; n, define the communication game CON N (m; n) to be the following DART (m; n) game: The input for Player I is (x i ) 1in , and for Player II (y i ) 1in .

Indeed, determining the monotone size (or depth) of a function is a very natural combinatorial problem, and monotone complexity may be relevant for several other complexity issues. One important example is propositional proof theory, where following 3 <ref> [Ra94] </ref> and Bonet et. al [BoPiRa95], reductions to monotone complexity were ex-tensively used. In particular, using techniques developed in the sequence of papers [ImPiUr94, BoPiRa95, Kr95], Pudlak [Pu95] used monotone complexity to obtain an impressive exponential lower bound for the length of cutting planes proofs (see also, [CoHa95, Fu96]).

Reference-contexts: Some other direct lower bounds for the monotone depth of functions are known. In particular, a tight lower bound of (n) was proved for the monotone depth of the Matching function <ref> [RaWi90] </ref>. The Matching function, however, is not in monotone-P, as a super-polynomial lower bound for its monotone size was proved in [Ra85b]. If sub-exponential upper bounds for the monotone size of the Matching function were shown then the result of [RaWi90] would have given a separation of classes of monotone depth <p> was proved for the monotone depth of the Matching function <ref> [RaWi90] </ref>.

If sub-exponential upper bounds for the monotone size of the Matching function were shown then the result of [RaWi90] would have given a separation of classes of monotone depth (by a padding argument). It is still open, however, whether such an upper bound exists. For more information about the early results in monotone complexity see the 2 excellent survey of [BoSi90]. <p> Indeed, by the results of [Ra85b, Ta88], the monotone size of a function may be exponentially larger than its non-monotone size.

Obviously, for k = (n), that lower bound is tight. For smaller values of k, however, the lower bound is not tight. Here we prove that for k n * (for some small constant * &gt; 0), the monotone depth of k-clique is (k log n).
