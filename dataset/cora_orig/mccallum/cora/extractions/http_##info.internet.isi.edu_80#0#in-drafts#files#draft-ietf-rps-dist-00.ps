Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract The RIPE database specifications [2] and RPSL language [1] define languages used as the basis for representing information in a routing policy system. A repository for routing policy system information is known as a routing registry. A routing registry provides a means of exchanging information needed to address many issues on importance to the operation of the Internet. The implementation and deployment of a routing policy system must maintain some degree of integrety to be of any use. The Routing Policy System Security internet-draft [3] addresses the need to assure integrety of the data by proposing an authentication and authorization model. This document addresses the need to distribute data over multiple repositories and delegate authority for data subsets to multiple repositories without compromising the authorization model extablished in [3].

Objects consist of a set of attributes. Attributes are name value pairs. A single attribute is represented as a single line with the name followed by a colon followed by whitespace characters (space, tab, or line continuation) and followed by the value.

Reference-contexts: The repository object is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In each repository there should be a special repository object named ROOT. This should point to the root repository or to a higher level repository. <p> For example, a disgruntled employee at a client of the repository may remove all authorization from that clients database objects. There may be opportunities for malicious entries in objects for which there is no authorization hierarchy (See <ref> [3] </ref>). An example is the anonymous registration of falsified person objects or liablous or obescene person or role objects. <p> This method should be supported by an external application for backwards compatibility only. Merit has added the pgp-from authentication method to the RADB (replaced by pgp-key in <ref> [3] </ref>), where the mail headers are essentially ignored and the body of the mail message must be PGP signed. For backwards compatibility objects submitted in an email message, even if signed as a group, should be treated as separate transactions as they are today.
