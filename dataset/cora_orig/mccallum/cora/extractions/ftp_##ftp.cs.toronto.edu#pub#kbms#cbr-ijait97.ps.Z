Abstract: Classification involves associating instances with particular classes by maximizing intra-class similarities and minimizing inter-class similarities. Thus, the way similarity among instances is measured is crucial for the success of the system. In case-based reasoning, it is assumed that similar problems have similar solutions. The case-based approach to classification is founded on retrieving cases from the case base that are similar to a given problem, and associating the problem with the class containing the most similar cases. Similarity-based retrieval tools can advantageously be used in building flexible retrieval and classification systems. Case-based classification uses previously classified instances to label unknown instances with proper classes. Classification accuracy is affected by the retrieval process the more relevant the instances used for classification, the greater the accuracy. The paper presents a novel approach to case-based classification. The algorithm is based on a notion of similarity assessment and was developed for supporting flexible retrieval of relevant information. Case similarity is assessed with respect to a given context that defines constraints for matching. Context relaxation and restriction is used for controlling the classification accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is tested on real-world domains, and the system's performance, in terms of accuracy and scalability, is compared to that of other machine learning algorithms.

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of this paper, it is assumed that the categories have been determined a priori from a prescribed domain theory [44]. Various techniques have been utilized for the classification task, for example neural networks [43], genetic algorithms [13], inductive and instance-based learning <ref> [1, 46, 42] </ref> and case-based reasoning [36, 4]. Individual approaches are compared to one another based on the method they deploy, the accuracy they achieve, and the complexity of the used algorithm. Most systems extract classification rules from training examples during a learning process.

Reference-contexts: Individual systems are usually tested on different problem domains, and because of differences in domain complexities, obtained performance measures cannot be compared directly. While performance is highly domain dependent, it is possible to derive evaluation techniques that allow for a meaningful performance comparison of different algorithms <ref> [2, 32] </ref>. This paper presents a novel, case-based classification scheme, called T A3 , and evaluates it with respect to several real-world domains. The proposed algorithm is based on a notion of relevance assessment [20] and on a modified nearest-neighbor matching [47]. <p> This allows for making each and every attribute potentially significant as well as assigning objects to different classes. The system also allows for identifying hierarchies of attributes, selecting common attributes and distinguishing attributes between classes. IB1 <ref> [2, 5] </ref> is a nearest-neighbor, instance-based learning system used for classification and for control tasks. Based on a problem description, IB1 retrieves the k-nearest neighbors and uses them to supply a solution to a given problem. <p> Many times neglected, yet important, is the dependency of the system on the case base size and the problem complexity. Performance evaluation must be conducted with a special care on the used data set and on the selected measures <ref> [2] </ref>. It is not only important to know what to measure when evaluating a system, but also to know how to interpret the results. There are many accepted benchmarks used in different fields and there are numerous evaluations available. <p> The second characteristic measures how long it takes for the system to perform the specified task. In addition, scalability measures task/time performance dependability on the case base size. It should be noted, that accuracy is not only system dependent but is also strongly domain dependent <ref> [2] </ref>. Kononenko and Bratko [32] present a fair evaluation criterion to measure classification accuracy. The motivation for the study is that a simple comparison of classification accuracy might be misleading. <p> T A3 Robot2 used attribute value relaxation first, and only when this failed was reduction performed. 4.4 Problem 4: Character recognition domain The letter classification task has previously been used for machine learning algorithm testing <ref> [13, 2] </ref>. 7 The data set consists of 20,000 instances described by 17 attributes: letter, horizontal and vertical position of a box, width and height of a box, total number of pixels, 7 Data description and performance results obtained by other machine learning systems applied to the letter recognition domain are

Reference-contexts: Although it has been acknowledged that context plays a central role in determining similarity, previous works on similarity measures for case-based reasoning generally assume that context is implicit in the case representation, or is acquired through machine learning techniques <ref> [8] </ref>. We define context as a parameter of a similarity relation and demonstrate the monotonicity of case retrieval. We show how this property can be used for controlling the classification accuracy.

Reference-contexts: In this system, classification is combined with explanation. Explanation is used for justifying case classification and for determining similarity between two cases. An incremental retrieval system, I-CBR, is presented in <ref> [11] </ref>. For this case-based reasoning paradigm, the user specifies a case skeleton and attempts to retrieve all cases similar to it. I-CBR partitions case attributes into two groups: the ones that are known immediately and the ones that need some extra effort to specify. <p> Using different context and criteria affects the time spent on searching for the solution as well as the quality of the solution. T A3 allows for tuning the reasoning process to meet different requirements, as suggested by Cunningham et al. <ref> [11] </ref>. On the one hand, in the medical domain [29, 28], a more accurate suggestion for the hormonal therapy has a positive impact on pregnancy and is also cost effective, since it minimizes the quantity of hormones given to the patient.

Reference-contexts: Thus, even though the treatment should be suggested reasonably fast, clearly accuracy is more important. Using the terminology of normative rationality introduced in <ref> [16] </ref>, medical application of the T A3 system follows type I rationality, i.e., inference that is consistent with the axioms of decision theory regardless of the cost of inference.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the better the similarity-based retrieval, the better the classification accuracy. The main objective of the evaluation presented here is to test task performance [26]. Time performance has been reported elsewhere <ref> [19] </ref>. 4.1 Problem 1: IVF case base The in-vitro fertilization (IVF) domain involves medical records about patients. The available case base consists of 788 cases and 55 attributes per case (after confidential information has been removed). <p> The computer time (in ms) required to perform three consecutive context modifications was measured, considering the same query for different case base sizes. 8 Comparing naive (standard retrieval algorithm) and incremental algorithms shows that k consecutive context transformations require k applications of the naive algorithm <ref> [27, 19] </ref>. Thus, a naive approach requires kfi j CB j fi j j evaluations (j CB j denotes a case base size and j j denotes the size of a context). <p> The computer time required to perform three consecutive context transformations was measured, considering the same query for different case base sizes. These results are compared to the results when robotic, servo, medical and character recognition domains were used, using logarithmic scale. In <ref> [19] </ref> we discuss performance improvements using incremental algorithm, considering the cost of retrieval for context relaxation and restriction as a function of case base size and context. 8 TA3 is implemented in C++ on a SUN workstation.

Based on the proposed theory, we have applied the research prototype T A3 to several real-world domains: 5 a medical domain (T A3 IV F ) <ref> [29, 28] </ref>, a servo-mechanism (T A3 Servo ) domain, a robotic domain (T A3 Robot ) [25, 27], a letter classification domain (T A3 Letter ) [23] and a small software case base (T A3 SR ) [22]. <p> Using different context and criteria affects the time spent on searching for the solution as well as the quality of the solution. T A3 allows for tuning the reasoning process to meet different requirements, as suggested by Cunningham et al. [11]. On the one hand, in the medical domain <ref> [29, 28] </ref>, a more accurate suggestion for the hormonal therapy has a positive impact on pregnancy and is also cost effective, since it minimizes the quantity of hormones given to the patient. Thus, even though the treatment should be suggested reasonably fast, clearly accuracy is more important.

Reference-contexts: Even though it is relatively inefficient, considering the sample complexity, it is an interesting step towards a computational learning theory for CBR systems. PROTOS [36] is a a case-based system used for heuristic classification in the clinical audiology domain. The system uses exemplar-based learning <ref> [30, 6, 7, 3] </ref>, a method especially appropriate for domains lacking a strong domain theory. In this system, classification is combined with explanation. Explanation is used for justifying case classification and for determining similarity between two cases. An incremental retrieval system, I-CBR, is presented in [11].

Reference-contexts: Attribute membership in a particular category is defined either using domain knowledge or using a knowledge discovery algorithm [12, 23, 28]. This grouping allows for ascribing different constraints to different groups of attributes, and the process of retrieving relevant cases can be described as a constraint satisfaction process <ref> [45, 14, 31] </ref>.

The goal is to retrieve not only exact matches, but partial matches (similar cases) as well.

Reference-contexts: Individual systems are usually tested on different problem domains, and because of differences in domain complexities, obtained performance measures cannot be compared directly. While performance is highly domain dependent, it is possible to derive evaluation techniques that allow for a meaningful performance comparison of different algorithms <ref> [2, 32] </ref>. This paper presents a novel, case-based classification scheme, called T A3 , and evaluates it with respect to several real-world domains. The proposed algorithm is based on a notion of relevance assessment [20] and on a modified nearest-neighbor matching [47]. <p> The second characteristic measures how long it takes for the system to perform the specified task. In addition, scalability measures task/time performance dependability on the case base size. It should be noted, that accuracy is not only system dependent but is also strongly domain dependent [2]. Kononenko and Bratko <ref> [32] </ref> present a fair evaluation criterion to measure classification accuracy. The motivation for the study is that a simple comparison of classification accuracy might be misleading.

Reference-contexts: larger, i.e., 1 2 ), only rectangles a and c are similar rectangle b does not qualify since it matches only part of a given context. 4 The proof of Theorem 3.2 is available in Appendix. 12 The usefulness of the monotonicity feature during the retrieval process was reported in <ref> [41, 33, 20] </ref>. On the one hand, if not enough cases have been retrieved from the case base, the initial context may be relaxed to retrieve additional less similar cases.

Reference-contexts: T A3 (pronounced tah-tree) 1 is different from other case-based approaches since instead of using predefined retrieval strategies, case retrieval is custom-tailored and dynamically changed for a particular domain and specific application. This flexibility is accomplished by using context in similarity-based retrieval, deploying the Telos <ref> [34] </ref> representation language which treats objects and attributes uniformly. <p> Using the information about the usefulness of individual attributes and information about their properties, attributes are grouped into two or more Telos-style categories <ref> [34] </ref>. This enhancement of case representations will be used during the retrieval process to increase the accuracy of classification and flexibility of retrieval, and to improve system performance. In classification tasks, each case has at least two categories: problem description and class.

Reference-contexts: Such a performance degradation of IB1 can be solved either by data preprocessing that would remove all irrelevant attributes or by the use of an intelligent, selective partial matching algorithm. The latter approach is similar to m of n concepts in machine learning <ref> [35] </ref>, i.e., the system considers only m &lt; n attributes during retrieval. There are various methods used to decide m and Ortega [35] presents an evaluation of system performance for various m. <p> The latter approach is similar to m of n concepts in machine learning <ref> [35] </ref>, i.e., the system considers only m &lt; n attributes during retrieval. There are various methods used to decide m and Ortega [35] presents an evaluation of system performance for various m. In addition to deciding the size of m, the approach described in this paper allows for specifying which attributes to exclude and for posing additional constraints on attribute values, if desired.

Reference-contexts: The requirement for such algorithms is that created rules correctly 4 classify known, i.e., training, examples and perform well on novel (i.e., test) examples <ref> [37] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Classification systems are relevant due to the fact that we apply case-based reasoning to a classification problem and similarity-based retrieval algorithms are relevant because this type of retrieval is the basis of our approach.

Reference-contexts: In general, this process consists of first generating a set of categories and then classifying given objects into the created categories. For the purpose of this paper, it is assumed that the categories have been determined a priori from a prescribed domain theory <ref> [44] </ref>. Various techniques have been utilized for the classification task, for example neural networks [43], genetic algorithms [13], inductive and instance-based learning [1, 46, 42] and case-based reasoning [36, 4]. <p> Such domains are called imperfect. In conventional data analysis, objects are clustered into classes based on a distance or similarity measure <ref> [44] </ref>. The similarity between two objects is represented as a number - the value of a similarity function applied to symbolic descriptions of objects. Thus, the similarity measure is context free. <p> Thus, the similarity measure is context free.

Using this method, a set of objects forms a class only if it can be described by a conjunctive concept involving relations on object attributes.
