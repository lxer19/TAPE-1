Abstract: Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. Walras provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.

Reference-contexts: Although the resulting allocation of resources is identical, a qualitative change in market structure here corresponds to a qualitative change in the degree of decentralization. In fact, the behavior of walras on the market configuration with arbitrageurs is virtually identical to a standard distributed algorithm <ref> (Gallager, 1977) </ref> for multicommodity flow (minimum delay on communication networks). In Gallager's algorithm, distributed modules expressly differentiate the cost function to derive the marginal cost of increasing flow on a communication link. Flows are adjusted up or down so to equate the marginal costs along competing subpaths.

Reference-contexts: There are also some intermediate possibilities, corresponding to game-theoretic equilibrium concepts such as the Nash equilibrium, where each shipper behaves optimally given the transportation policies of the remaining shippers <ref> (Harker, 1986) </ref>. 4 From our perspective as designer of the distributed planner, we seek a decentralization mechanism that will reach the system equilibrium, or come as close as possible given the distributed decision-making structure.

Reference-contexts: Although congestion is a real factor in transportation networks, for example, for many modes of transport there are often other economies of scale and density that may lead to returns that are increasing overall <ref> (Harker, 1987) </ref>. Note that strategic interactions, increasing returns, and other factors degrading the effectiveness of market mechanisms also inhibit decentralization in general, and so would need to be addressed directly in any approach. <p> Some of these may be captured by incremental extensions to the simple model, perhaps applying elaborations developed by the transportation science community. For example, many transportation models (including Harker's more elaborate formulation <ref> (Harker, 1987) </ref>) allow for variable supply and demand of the commodities and more complex shipper-carrier relationships. Concepts of spatial price equilibrium, based on markets for commodities in each location, seem to offer the most direct approach toward extending the transportation model within walras. 6.

Reference-contexts: In the Nash solution, shippers correctly anticipate the effect of their own cargo movements on the average cost on each link. The resulting equilibrium converges to the user equilibrium as the number of shippers increases and the effect of any individual's behavior on prices diminishes <ref> (Haurie & Marcotte, 1985) </ref>. 10 Market-Oriented Programming To decentralize the decision making, we identify each movement requirement with a distinct shipper agent. These shippers, or consumers, have an interest in moving various units of cargo between specified origins and destinations. The interconnectedness of agents and goods defines the market configuration.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps most interestingly, by controlling the agents' knowledge of the market structure (via standard information-encapsulation techniques), we can degrade their ability to exploit whatever market power they possess. Uncertainty has been shown to increase competitiveness among risk-averse agents in some formal bidding models <ref> (McAfee & McMillan, 1987) </ref>, and in a computational environment we have substantial control over this uncertainty. The existence of competitive equilibria and efficient market allocations also depends critically on the assumption of nonincreasing returns to scale.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, gross substitutability will be violated when there are complementarities in preferences or technologies such that reduced consumption for one good will cause reduced consumption in others as well <ref> (Samuelson, 1974) </ref>. 2.3 WALRAS Bidding Protocol The method employed by walras successively computes an equilibrium price in each separate market, in a manner detailed below. Like tatonnement, it involves an iterative adjustment of prices based on reactions of the agents in the market.

Reference-contexts: This distribution of goods and activities constitutes the market solution to the planning problem. 1. The name was inspired by Shoham's use of agent-oriented programming to refer to a specialization of object-oriented programming where the entities are described in terms of agent concepts and interact via speech acts <ref> (Shoham, 1993) </ref>. Market-oriented programming is an analogous specialization, where the entities are economic agents that interact according to market concepts of production and exchange. <p> We take the distributivity constraint as exogenously imposed; when the constraint is relaxable, both organizational and economic analysis illuminate the tradeoffs underlying the mechanism design problem. Finally, market-oriented programming shares with Shoham's agent-oriented programming <ref> (Shoham, 1993) </ref> the view that distributed problem-solving modules are best designed and understood as rational agents.

Reference-contexts: Without an expressly distributed formulation, however, these techniques may violate the decentralization considerations underlying our distributed problem-solving context. This is quite acceptable for the purposes these algorithms were originally designed, namely to analyze existing decentralized structures, such as transportation industries or even entire economies <ref> (Shoven & Whalley, 1992) </ref>. But because our purpose is to implement a distributed system, we must obey computational distributivity constraints not relevant to the usual purposes of applied general-equilibrium analysis.
