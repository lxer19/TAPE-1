Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general method for Bayesian computing in richly-parameterized models, Structured Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC), that is based on a blocked hybrid of the Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. SMCMC speeds algorithm convergence by using the structure that is present in the problem to suggest an appropriate Metropolis-Hastings candidate distribution. While the approach is easiest to describe for hierarchical normal linear models, we show its extension to both non-normal and nonlinear cases to be straightforward. After describing the method in detail we compare its performance (both in terms of runtime and autocorrelation in the samples produced) to several other existing methods, including the traditional single-site updating Gibbs sampler available in the popular BUGS software package. Our results suggest significant improvements in convergence for many problems using SMCMC, as well as broad applicability of the method, including previously intractable hierarchical nonlinear model settings.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 offers three examples covering a range of modeling and computational complexity, from a simple linear model to an advanced nonlinear survival model. Besides illustrating the method's application, we compare SMCMC runtimes and effective sample sizes <ref> (Hastings, 1970) </ref> to those produced by standard algorithms, including BUGS, when such alternatives are feasible. <p> An algorithm that is very fast per iteration may produce highly autocorrelated samples, so that the sampler must be run for a large number of iterations. To make a fair comparison among different algorithms, we use the notion of effective sample size, or ESS <ref> (Hastings, 1970) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This contrasts with the most common approach to MCMC, which involves updating each parameter separately according to its complete conditional distribution, i.e., its distribution given the data and every other parameter in the model. The latter approach is taken by BUGS <ref> (Spiegelhalter et al., 1995a) </ref>, the most general and easy-to-use MCMC software package to date. While BUGS has been applied to an extraordinary range of models (Spiegelhalter et al., 1995b), high posterior correlations are particularly damaging to its univari-ate updating algorithms.
