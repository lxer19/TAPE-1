Abstract: In order to measure the effect of demands placed by WWW applications on network servers, it is necessary to generate realistic HTTP requests. In this project, the Scalable-Client architecture proposed by Gaurav Banga and Peter Druschel for measuring the capacity of a web server has been implemented and tested. Some extensions to their original model have been suggested, and partially developed. A

Reference-contexts: Using real workloads directly suffers from the experimental difficulties involved in non-intrusive measurement of a live system and irreproducibility of live workloads. Also, accurate generation of synthetic HTTP client traffic in a LAN environment is non-trivial.
