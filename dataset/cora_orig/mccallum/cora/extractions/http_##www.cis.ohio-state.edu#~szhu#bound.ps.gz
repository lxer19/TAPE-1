Abstract: The past decade has witnessed rapid development in accurate modeling of 3D targets and multiple sensor fusion in automatic target recognition (ATR), however, the scientific study for quantifying non-target objects in a cluttered scene has made very limited progress, due to its enormous difficulties. In this paper, we study two important themes in ATR: I) clutter modeling how can we build generic and low-dimensional probabilistic models for cluttered scenes, and how can we automatically learn such models from observed images? II) performance analysis how can we quantify the effects of clutter on the performance of the ATR algorithms, and how much do the learned clutter models improve ATR performance? We answer the above questions by combing two important trends which have emerged in the past few years. The first is the minimax entropy learning theory, proposed by Zhu, Wu and Mumford[12]. According to this theory, cluttered scenes are defined on random fields with features characterized by generic filters at various frequencies and orientations. Then a probability model is learned so that it reproduces the statistics of the most important features. The second is the theory for performance bounds (such as the Hilbert-Schmidt bound), proposed by Grenander, Miller and Srivastava[3]. This theory quantifies the accuracy of target estimation on Lie groups. We illustrate our theories by three groups of experiments: 1) clutter modeling, synthesis, removal; 2) effects of clutter on the performance bounds; 3) using a learned clutter model for ATR in contrast to an additive Gaussian noise model.

Reference-contexts: The signal is of stochastic nature. Now our questions are: given a set of observed signals, according to what probability distribution are they generated? According to the theory of Komogorov complexity <ref> [1] </ref>, The C code itself provides a lower bound for the Komogorov complexity. We argue that one may not have to recover the original stochastic process; instead, we may characterize the structures in the signal by a generic set of feature extractors, for example, wavelet transforms.

Reference-contexts: Such non-target objects, known as "clutter", cause false alarms in the background, or obscure the targets and thus deteriorate the ATR performance. In a recent ATR survey paper by the Army laboratories <ref> [6] </ref>, Ratches et. al. concluded that "the essence of understanding performance of ATR implementation is ... the mathematical descriptions of targets and clutter that enable understanding the fundamentals of the image content." In the past decades, the major progress in ATR performance have resulted from accurate target modeling and multiple sensor <p> A major barrier for increasing ATR performance is clutter modeling as stated in <ref> [6] </ref>: "Probably the key problem associated with understanding and predicting ATR performance is the scientific understanding and quantification of clutter as it affects detection." The early attempts in quantifying clutter have achieved very little success due to the insufficiency of these models [8, 9]. <p> With the rapid increase of computer power in the past decade, 3D model simulation and image rendering has been widely adopted in ATR and represents the major progress in improving ATR performance <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Another way of viewing this modeling problem is to consider our computer as an encoding device, and the best model should produces code that has the minimal description length for the data ensemble <ref> [7] </ref>. Thus ideally the true model should account for both the physical and chemical stochastic processes, for example one could simulate the natural stochastic processes by computer graphics, which, however, is computationally infeasible.
