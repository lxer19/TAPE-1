Title: Power Reduction by Low-Activity Data Path Design and SRAM Energy Models  
Author: Mir Azam, Robert Evans and Paul Franzon 
Address: Raleigh, NC 27695  
Affiliation: Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University,  
Abstract: This paper is focused on different levels of circuit design for efficient power management and speedup. The material is presented in two major categories | circuit modifications to save energy in the data path and the memory, and architectural modifications in the data path for power and performance optimizations. More specifically, we present a low power adder design technique, optimal SRAM design issues, and an execution bypass technique.
