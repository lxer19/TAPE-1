Abstract: Let L be a union of hyperplanes with s vertices. We prove that the runtime of a probabilistic linear search tree recognizing membership to L is at least (log s), provided that L satisfies a certain condition which could be treated as a generic position. A more general statement, namely without the condition, was claimed by F. Meyer auf der Heide [1], but the proof contained a mistake.

As in <ref> [1] </ref> one shows that for any vertex of L there exists * &gt; 0 such that each hyperplane occuring as a testing one in D which intersects the closed ball B * (v) of the radius * and with the center in v, should pass through v. 2 Similar to [1] <p> <ref> [1] </ref> one shows that for any vertex of L there exists * &gt; 0 such that each hyperplane occuring as a testing one in D which intersects the closed ball B * (v) of the radius * and with the center in v, should pass through v. 2 Similar to [1] select from D all the testing hyperplanes passing through v. Then the obtained thereby D 0 is ff -PLSA recognizing the language L"B * (v), when being restricted on B * (v). <p> The obtained contradiction proves the lemma. 2 3 Lower bound on the number of faces in PLSA Now we complete the proof of the theorem, the arguing is similar to one in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Hence there are at least ps = m c 2 n = pm (c 1 c 2 )n faces of D fl . But on the other hand, the number of faces in D fl does not exceed s 2T (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>), therefore 2 2T pm (c 1 c 2 )n , this completes the proof of the theorem. 4
