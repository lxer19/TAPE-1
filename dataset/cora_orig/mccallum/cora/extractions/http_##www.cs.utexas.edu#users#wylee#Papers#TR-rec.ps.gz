Reference-contexts: By using a local instead of a global frame of reference, the typical cumulative error and correspondence problems <ref> [Ayache and Faugeras, 1987; Brooks, 1985] </ref> are avoided. 5.5.2 Choice of Local Frame of Reference A Cartesian local frame of reference is chosen over other representations such as radial-based (e.g. LOGnets of Malkin and Addanki [1990]) or path-of-motion based frames of reference, for several reasons. <p> There are advantages and disadvantages to using a sonar feature based representation as compared to using an iconic representation like an occupancy grid. These aspects have been widely discussed in a related publications <ref> [Thrun and Bucken, 1996; Brooks, 1985; Leonard and Durrant-Whyte, 1992] </ref>. A relatively accurate local geometry of a place neighborhood can be used for localization of a robot. Leonard and Durrant-Whyte [1992], MacKenzie and Dudek 122 [1994], and Crowley [1985] use local sonar features based map for localization.

Reference-contexts: Brooks has been a strong proponent of such approach with his subsumption architecture <ref> [Brooks, 1986] </ref>. The reactive control paradigm has come in many different manifestations including Brooks' subsumption 10 architecture, behavioral-based control [Connell, 1990; Mataric, 1992], schemas [Arkin, 1990], pure stimulus-response [Anderson and Donath, 1990], and servo-process module [Noreils, 1989]. <p> In environments like indoor spaces where visual range is greatly limited, Qualnav's approach would seem poorly applicable. 16 2.4 Mataric (Toto) Mataric [1992] presented a map learning method implemented in the ,spirit of the subsumption architecture <ref> [Brooks, 1986] </ref>. Her robot, Toto, uses a ring of Polaroid sonar sensors for range sensing and an on-board compass for absolute bearing. Her approach models the world topologically with a graph in which nodes correspond to landmarks and edges are used to indicate topological adjacency.

Reference-contexts: Potential sampling error is reduced by high sampling rates. Even though the reactive approach has been shown to be successful in several physical robots <ref> [Brooks, 1990; Connell, 1990] </ref>, it has a number of shortcomings. In a reactive system, goals are implicit in that they are precompiled into the transfer functions.

Reference-contexts: Spot, in contrast, does not have to have access to global position and direction estimates in exploration, mapping and navigation. However, in the absence of such estimates, to discriminate similar looking places, Spot may have to perform physical travels as part of rehearsal procedures <ref> [Byun, 1990; Kuipers and Byun, 1987, 1988, 1991] </ref>. Neither Spot nor Toto attempt to model open spaces. 1 In the SSH approach, they are considered control laws or strategies. 17 2.5 Malkin and Addanki (LOGnets) Malkin and Addanki [1990] developed a hybrid graph spatial representation for robot navigation.

Reference-contexts: Kortenkamp et al. [1993] employed a different multilevel spatial representation for their robot RPLAN. Their representation is based on a computational model, PLAN <ref> [Chown et al., 1995] </ref>. Physical implementations of aspects of the SSH approach have also been built by other researchers. Among them are Mataric [1990], Connell [1992] Sarachik [1989], Kortenkamp [1993], Braunegg [1990], Malkin and Addanki [1990]. <p> His approach shows promise towards providing a robust representation for visual views for an SSH robot with vision capability. 2.8 Kortenkamp (RPLAN) Kortenkamp et al. [1993] implemented a computational model of human cognitive mapping called PLAN <ref> [Chown et al., 1995] </ref> on a mobile robot, resulting in a system they called RPLAN. RPLAN has three main components. The first component uses sonar and visual sensing to perform place recognition.

Reference-contexts: Currently, RPLAN and Spot are the only known physical mobile robot systems which implement a computational model of a cognitive map. 2.9 Connell (SSS) Connell's robot, TJ, implemented with the SSS (an acronym for "servo, subsumption, symbolic" systems) architecture <ref> [Connell, 1992] </ref> is capable of exploration, mapping and navigation. <p> The control laws should themselves be controllable by a higher level cognitive subsystem to achieve higher level goals or better performance through applying a learning method at the reactive level. Control laws such as classical PID control laws allow such controllability once they are properly parameterized (cf. <ref> [Connell, 1992] </ref>). Control gains and set-points are natural candidates for parameterization.

Reference-contexts: Polaroid and we have experimentally determined their minimum and maximum detectable ranges to be approximately 205 mm and 10675 mm respectively. 42 clockwise. 4.2 Difficulties with Sonar Sonars have been extensively used in mobile robotics for obstacle avoidance and range measurements because they are cheap and relatively easy to use <ref> [Moravec and Elfes, 1985; Crowley, 1985; Leonard and Durrant-Whyte, 1992] </ref>. However, they have a number of limitations, and should be used with caution and with a clear understanding of their limiting characteristics [Leonard and Durrant-Whyte, 1992; Mataric, 1992; Borenstein and Koren, 1988].

A large-scale space is a space whose structure is at a significantly larger scale than the observations available at any given instant [Kuipers and Levitt, 1988]. <p> Within this approach, some researchers did not adopt a multi-level spatial representation or a representation based on any computational model for human cognitive 14 mapping [Mataric, 1990; Malkin and Addanki, 1990; Sarachik, 1989; Engelson 1994].

Reference-contexts: of the state, ^x (t), for the controller or state regulator, r (^x (t)) so that it can compute a control signal, u (t), which drives the dynamical system. 3.4 Control Level Ontology The description of the control level ontology in this section is partly based on the development in <ref> [Kuipers, 1996] </ref>. At the SSH control level, the ontology is an egocentric sensorimotor one. The primitives are sensory and motor primitives, y (t) and u (t) respectively. These primitives include magnitude and gradient of sensory data values and derived sensory features. <p> The next section describes the ontology of the SSH causal level. A more complete formal description of the SSH causal level ontology is given in <ref> [Kuipers, 1996] </ref>. Later sections describe Spot's causal level. 6.2 Ontology 6.2.1 Views and Actions A view is a sensory image obtained at a distinctive state. <p> Schemas represent causal relationships among views and actions. The situation calculus is used to formalize the SSH causal level as described in <ref> [Kuipers, 1996] </ref>. The schema hV; A; V 0 i provides both declarative and imperative knowledge of routes and action procedures. <p> The next section describes the ontology of the SSH topological level. A more complete formal description of the ontology of the SSH topological level is presented in <ref> [Kuipers, 1996] </ref>. Later sections describe Spot's topological level knowledge. 7.2 Ontology 7.2.1 Places, Paths and Regions A place describes part of the robot's environment as a zero-dimensional point. It may be defined as an abstraction of a region.

Reference-contexts: Brooks has been a strong proponent of such approach with his subsumption architecture [Brooks, 1986].

A control problem is characterized by determination of the proper control signals as inputs to a controlled process (or plant as it is called in classical control theory) in order to effect a desired state trajectory or to maintain a desired state.

Reference-contexts: When uncertainties in modeling are used, Kalman filter based data assimilation or fusion can be applied <ref> [Smith and Cheeseman, 1986, Leonard and Durrant-Whyte, 1992; Recken, 1994] </ref>. For example, consider a point p 1 representing a convex corner with an associated position uncertainty represented as a covariance matrix fl 1 , and a second point p 2 with covariance matrix fl 2 . <p> Some of them are straightforward, others are not. Currently, Spot does not reason much with uncertainty in sensory data. If uncertainties in sensing and in motion are modeled, they can be used within a Kalman filter framework <ref> [Smith and Cheeseman, 1986, Leonard and Durrant-Whyte, 1992; Recken, 1994] </ref> or other frameworks in data assimilation and fusion. An example has been given in Section 6.4.4. Presently, Spot handles only junctions found on a typical indoor office floor.
