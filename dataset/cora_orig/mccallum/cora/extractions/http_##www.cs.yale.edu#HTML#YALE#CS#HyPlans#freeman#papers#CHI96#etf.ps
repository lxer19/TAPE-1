Abstract: We contend that managing one's own electronic world can be a frustrating task for most computer users, requiring too many separate applications, too many file transfers and format translations, the invention of too many pointless names and the construction of organizational hierarchies that too quickly become obsolete. What is needed is a metaphor and system for organizing the electronic "bits of paper" we all so easily collect, whether we create them ourselves or they come to us in the form of email, downloaded images, web pages, or scheduling reminders. Lifestreams is such a system. BASIC MODEL Lifestreams uses a simple organizational metaphor, a time-ordered stream of documents, to replace conventional files and directories [3, 4]. Stream filters and software agents are used to organize, locate, summarize and monitor incoming information. Lifestreams subsumes many separate desktop applications to accomplish the most common communication, scheduling, and search and retrieval tasks; yet its machine-independent, client-server architecture is open so that users can continue to use the document types, and viewers & editors they are accustomed to. A lifestream is a time-ordered stream of documents that functions as a diary of your electronic life; every document you create is stored in your lifestream, as are the documents other people send you. The tail of your stream contains documents from the past, perhaps starting with your electronic birth certificate. Moving away from the tail and toward the present, your stream contains more recent documents such as papers in progress or the latest electronic mail you've received|other documents, such as pictures, correspondence, bills, movies, voice mail and software are stored in between. Moving beyond the present and into the future, the stream contains documents you will need: reminders, your calendar items, and to-do lists. Lifestreams provides a metaphor for organizing the electronic documents we all so easily collect|whether they come to us in the form of electronic mail, downloaded images, pages gathered from the Web, or scheduling reminders|in a fluid and natural way that reflects the way users work. Color and animation indicate important document features. The borders of unread documents are colored red, the borders of writable documents made thicker and open documents are offset to the side to indicate they are being edited. Incoming documents slide in from the left side to alert the user, and newly created documents pop down from the top and push the stream backwards by one document into the past. In this way documents
