Abstract: We consider a reinterpretation of the rules of default logic. We make Reiter's default rules into a constructive method of building models, not theories. To allow reasoning in first order systems, we equip standard first-order logic with a (new) Kleene 3-valued partial model semantics. Then, using our methodology, we add defaults to this semantic system. The result is that our logic is an ordinary monotonic one, but its semantics is now nonmonotonic. Reiter's extensions now appear in the semantics, not in the syntax. As an application, we show that this semantics gives a partial solution to the conceptual problems with open defaults pointed out by Lifschitz [16], and Baader and Hollunder [2]. The solution is not complete, chiefly because in making the defaults model-theoretic, we can only add conjunctive information to our models. This is in contrast to default theories, where extensions can contain disjunctive formulas, and therefore disjunctive information. Our proposal to treat the problem of open defaults uses a semantic notion of nonmono-tonic entailment for our logic, deriving from the idea of "only knowing". Our notion is "only having information" given by a formula. We discuss the differences between this and "minimal-knowledge" ideas. Finally, we consider the Kraus-Lehmann-Magidor [14] axioms for preferential consequence relations. We find that our consequence relation satisfies the most basic of the laws, and the Or law, but it does not satisfy the law of Cut, nor the law of Cautious Monotony. We give intuitive examples using our system, on the other hand, which on the surface seem to violate these laws, no matter how they are interpreted. We make some comparisons, using our examples, to probabilistic interpretations for which the laws are true, and we compare our models to the cumulative models of Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor. We also show sufficient conditions for the laws to hold. These involve limiting the use of disjunction in our formulas in one way or another. We show how to make use of the theory of complete partially ordered sets, or domain theory. We can augment any Scott domain with a default set. We state a version of Re-iter's extension operator on arbitrary domains as well. This version makes clear the basic

Reference-contexts: There is more to the story of default models. In [24] we show that default models and their logics solve some of the semantic problems with Reiter's default logic. This includes, in particular, a treatment of subjective degrees of belief, as in the work of Bacchus, Halpern, et al. <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to this problem, and solution in this example, involves defining a first-order logic which is sensitive to constraints: laws which govern the behavior of partial models, but which are in the background. (This is an idea taken from situation theory; see Barwise's book <ref> [4] </ref>.) In the above case, situations must respect the constraint that "spouse" is a partial function.

Reference-contexts: The relations j= and =j are read "positively satisfies" and "negatively satisfies" respectively. As usual, we write A (M; C) j= ' iff for all (s; ff) we have (s; ff) j= '. Our semantics is a standard one for Kleene 3-valued logic; see <ref> [5] </ref> for a complete treatment. In particular, the defaults play no role; the nonmonotonic effect of the defaults will be considered in the next section. We need the following result about the semantics.

Reference-contexts: There are in fact other options for reclaiming cautious monotony. For example, we could define an order-theoretic version of Brewka's cumulative default logic in <ref> [6] </ref>, which was a response to Makinson's examples. Another possibility for the normal default case would be to use a different kind of "extension." In [23], we have introduced such an operator, which has cumulativity "built in." It is called a dilation.

Reference-contexts: But once again our models generalize to many more than first-order ones. The laws we obtain for nonmonotonic entailment are more conservative than the KLM laws. One might see this as evidence that our theory is incorrect. We have indicated that there are other studies (for example <ref> [7] </ref>) in which various of the laws are not true. We hope that our counterexamples are realistic enough to at least suggest more careful study of the notion.

Reference-contexts: In the paper, after having stated a domain-theoretic version of defaults, we apply our notion to the case of first-order logic. We equip ordinary first-order logic with partial models, also called situations. We interpret negation in the strong Kleene three-valued sense, as in the work of Doherty and Lukaszewicz <ref> [8] </ref> and others. A new aspect of our construction is that we can have partial models which respect background constraints. It is then straightforward to add defaults to these partial models. One application of this new semantics is to the problem of correctly interpreting open defaults.

Reference-contexts: This way of unifying the semantics of differing logics was initiated by Shoham [26]. One logic, for a long time, resisted attempts to provide it with a preferential model semantics: Reiter's default logic [21]. Etherington <ref> [9] </ref> gave a preferential semantics, involving sets of first-order models rather than simple models. Other model theories by now are known. Many of these come from other nonmonotonic logics by means of a translation of default theories to the other logics.

Reference-contexts: We try to capture it by the use of minimal models, which of course we must define The word "positive" is occasioned by our three-valued Kleene semantics. Finally, the use of default models is in some sense anticipated by the work of Guerreiro and Casanova <ref> [10] </ref> and Lifschitz [16]. Our definition is much more radical than theirs. Although their semantics involves a fixed-point construction in model-theoretic space, they still regard extensions as theories. Lifschitz in particular also uses a "fixed-universe" construction to deal with extensions for open defaults, as we do. <p> Lifschitz notes that the problems of ground terms should be overcome by a treatment of default logic involving the realm of models. In that realm, one can talk about domain elements directly, without having to refer to their syntactic names. He cites a result of Guerreiro and Casanova <ref> [10] </ref> characterizing extensions of closed theories using a model-theoretic fixpoint construction, and then generalizes this construction to the case of open defaults. Our approach to these problems is similar in spirit to that of Lifschitz, but much more direct.

Reference-contexts: First, it uses extensions as models, not theories. Second, the intuitive interpretation of our entailment is "if I can confirm only the information given by ', then I can believe (skeptically) fi." This idea is related to, but is not the same as, the notion of "only knowing" [15], <ref> [11] </ref>. We try to capture it by the use of minimal models, which of course we must define The word "positive" is occasioned by our three-valued Kleene semantics. Finally, the use of default models is in some sense anticipated by the work of Guerreiro and Casanova [10] and Lifschitz [16]. <p> note here that one speaks about modal formulas, for which models are sets of propositional valuations, so that it makes sense to compare models by inclusion.) The precise details of the differences between the model constructions of Schwarz and Truszczynski, and those of other authors, such as Halpern and Moses <ref> [11] </ref>, need not concern us here, because we are treating a differing notion: that of the minimal information conveyed by a formula or theory. This information is measured by the inclusion relation on partial models directly, and does not contain any kind of self-knowledge.

Reference-contexts: It was, however, less clear to us how to do this generalization than it was in the case of defaults. Our results on open defaults do not completely satisfy us. Kaminski, in <ref> [12] </ref>, has given a full study of the problems with these systems. We need to understand, perhaps, how an open default of the types studied by Kaminski can interpreted model-theoretically in a default system.

Reference-contexts: Exactly how to go about this is still unclear at present. We can, however, consider specializing first-order systems. This could provide a tool for adding defaults to terminological logic systems, another project currently under investigation. Even the special case of feature logic <ref> [13] </ref> is interesting. Finally, one of the most exciting prospects for our approach is to combine reasoning about programs with default reasoning, using the common framework of domain theory, which at the very least has shown itself as a superb tool for understanding the former.

Reference-contexts: Lifschitz in [16], and Baader and Hollunder in [2], have shown that Reiter's treatment leads to conceptual difficulties.

Lifschitz, in <ref> [16] </ref>, points out that this treatment can make the effect of a default weaker than intended. He considers the default theory with one axiom P (a) and one default : :P (x) : (2) This default is intended to express that P (x) is assumed to be false wherever possible.

There are in fact other options for reclaiming cautious monotony.

Further, in <ref> [22] </ref> we have shown that the propositional modal version of our logic, using weak rather than strong Kleene negation, has a sound and complete equational axiomatization, and an NP-complete validity decision problem. 2 On open defaults Many of the interesting applications of default logic involve the notion of an open default: <p> We could add a modality B to L. B' is read "' is believed." The meaning of B' is that with respect to a situation w, ' holds in all extensions of w. This was done in <ref> [22] </ref>. The semantics of this language is its nonstandard feature. Our structures will be default information systems based on some particular set of individuals M , but we first have to assume some background constraints on any relations which are going to be holding in such sets M .

We write ffi (x) for the set of extensions of x. <p> For example, given a placement x, is there an extension y which uses all eight queens? This corresponds exactly to our philosophy: default systems are used model-theoretically, and logic is used to describe default models.
