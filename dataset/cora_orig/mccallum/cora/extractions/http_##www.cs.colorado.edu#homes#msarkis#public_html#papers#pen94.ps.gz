Title: Multilevel Methods for P 1 Nonconforming Finite Elements and Discontinuous Coefficients in Three Dimensions  
Author: MARCUS SARKIS 
Note: Contemporary Mathematics Volume 00, 0000  
Abstract: We introduce multilevel Schwarz preconditioners for solving the discrete algebraic equations that arise from a nonconforming P 1 finite element method approximation of second order elliptic problems. For the additive multilevel version, we obtain a condition number bounded by C 1 (1 + log H=h) 2 from above, and for the multiplicative versions, such as the V-cycle multigrid methods using Gauss Seidel and damped Ja-cobi smoothers, we obtain a rate of convergence bounded from above by 1 C 2 (1 + log H=h) 2 .

In this paper, we modify the Oswald preconditioner by introducing our nonstandard coarse spaces Sarkis [13], and establish that its condition number grows at most as the square of the number of levels, and does not depend on the number of substructures and the jumps of the coefficients.
