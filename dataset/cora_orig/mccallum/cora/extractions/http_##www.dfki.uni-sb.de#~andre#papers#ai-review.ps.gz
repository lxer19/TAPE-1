Title: Generating Coherent Presentations Employing Textual and Visual Material  
Author: Elisabeth Andre, Thomas Rist 
Address: Stuhlsatzenhausweg 3, D-66123 Saarbrucken  
Affiliation: German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  
Abstract: The objective of the work described in this paper is the development of an intelligent generation system which is able to combine textual and visual material. As coherent presentations cannot be generated by simply merging verbalization and visualization results into multimedia output, the processes for content determination, medium selection and content realization in different media have to be carefully coordinated. We first show that multimedia presentations and pure text follow similar structuring principles. Based on this insight, we sketch how techniques for planning text and discourse can be generalized to allow the structure and contents of multimedia communications to be planned as well. In particular, we explain how our approach handles the crucial task of process coordination.

Reference-contexts: of the contents of the presentation. 2.1 Multimedia generation as a goal-directed activity Our approach is based on the assumption that not only the generation of text, but also the generation of multimedia presentations can be considered as a sequence of acts that 3 aims to achieve certain goals (cf. <ref> [ Andre & Rist 90 ] </ref> ). We presume that there is at least one act that is central to the goal of the whole document. This act is referred to as the main act (MA).

Reference-contexts: Consequently, it may happen that the results provided by the generators deviate to a certain extent from the initial document plan. Such deviations are reflected in the DAG by output sharing, structure sharing and structure adding (see also <ref> [ Andre & Rist 93 ] </ref> ). Output sharing occurs when parts of the generated output are reused for different purposes. Structure sharing is similar to output sharing. It occurs when not only parts of the output, but also a more complex part of the DAG is shared.

Reference-contexts: Here, we have to consider whether the user is intended to employ all parts of a presentation for object disambiguation or whether he is supposed to infer anaphoric relations between them. 6 In <ref> [ Andre & Rist 94 ] </ref> , we have presented a model of referring which is based on the following assumptions: 1.

Reference-contexts: When a presenter refers to an object, the addressee is intended to activate a mental representation of this object which is already available or which has to be built up (see also <ref> [ Appelt & Kronfeld 87 ] </ref> ). Mental representations can be activated not only by textual, but also by graphical or mixed descriptions. 2. Failure and success of referring acts can be explained by the user's ability to recognize certain links between these mental representations and the corresponding object descriptions.

Reference-contexts: This tree is extended by the medium-specific generators in a monotone manner. The system does not allow for revisions caused by medium selection. Arens and colleagues <ref> [ Arens et al. 93a ] </ref> propose a strict separation of planning and medium selection processes. During the planning process, their system fully specifies the 12 discourse structure, which is determined by the communicative goals of the presenter and the content to be communicated.

Reference-contexts: After that, the generated structures are transformed into text and graphics. A disadvantage of this method is that text and graphics are built up independently of each other. In COMET <ref> [ Feiner & McKeown 91 ] </ref> , a tree-like structure that reflects the organization of the presentation to be generated is built up first. This tree is extended by the medium-specific generators in a monotone manner. The system does not allow for revisions caused by medium selection.

Reference-contexts: For other applications, it is up to the presentation system to extract the information to be communicated from a knowledge base. When determining the contents of a presentation, the system should follow the maxims of Grice <ref> [ Grice 75 ] </ref> which are of course not restricted to natural language. On the one hand, the system has to ensure that all relevant information will be encoded. On the other hand, the user should not be unnecessarily informed about facts he already knows.

Reference-contexts: In most cases, cross-media referring expressions are part of a complex multimedia referring expression where they serve to direct the reader's attention to parts of a document that are needed to find the intended referent. Anaphoric referring expressions refer to world objects in an abbreviated form (cf. <ref> [ Hirst 81 ] </ref> ) presuming that they are already explicitly or implicitly introduced in the discourse. The presentation part to which an anaphoric expression refers back is called the antecedent of the referring expression.

Reference-contexts: An attempt at a transfer of the relations proposed by Hobbs to pictures and text-picture combinations has been made in [ Bandyopadhyay 90 ] . Many psychological and pedagogical studies focus on the various functions of pictures in illustrated documents (cf. <ref> [ Willows & Houghton 87; Houghton & Willows 87 ] </ref> ). Unfortunately, these studies only consider whole pictures, i.e., they do not address the question of how a picture is organized. <p> To prioritize presentation strategies, we use selection rules. For example, the selection rule below suggests the use of graphics rather than text when presenting spatial information. IF (Isa ?current-attribute-value SPATIAL-CONCEPT) THEN (TryBefore ?graphics-strategies? ?text-strategies?) Extended studies of relevant psychological literature (e.g., see <ref> [ Willows & Houghton 87; Houghton & Willows 87 ] </ref> ) and our own analyses of various illustrated documents form the basis of our selection rules and presentation strategies.

Reference-contexts: Whereas the header of a strategy is a complex communicative act (e.g. to enable an action), its effect refers to an intentional goal (e.g. the user knows a particular object). To represent intentional goals, we use the same notation as in Hovy's RST planner (cf. <ref> [ Hovy 88 ] </ref> ).

Reference-contexts: For example, Levin has found five primary functions (cf. [ Levin et al. 87 ] ): Decoration, Representation, Organization, Interpretation and Transformation. Hunter and colleagues distinguish between: Embellish, Reinforce, Elaborate, Summarize and Compare (cf. <ref> [ Hunter et al. 87 ] </ref> ).

Reference-contexts: While the root of the hierarchy generally corresponds to a complex communicative act such as describing a process, the leaves are elementary acts, i.e., speech acts (cf. [ Searle 80 ] ) or pictorial acts (cf. <ref> [ Kjorup 78 ] </ref> ). In Fig. 1, an example of a document fragment 2 is shown with its intentional structure. The goal of this document fragment is to get the user to remove the cover of the water container of an espresso machine.

Reference-contexts: Examples of RST-relations are Motivation, Elaboration, Enablement, Interpretation and Summary.

Reference-contexts: A problem with this approach is that the presentation structure obviously has no influence on the discourse structure. The selection of a medium is influenced by the discourse structure, but the contents are determined independently of the medium. In AIMI <ref> [ Maybury 93 ] </ref> , content selection and content organization are done in parallel. Although AIMI performs medium selection during content selection, dependencies between content selection and medium selection can be handled only to a limited extent.

Reference-contexts: The applicability conditions specify when a strategy may be used and constrain the variables to be instantiated. The main and subsidiary acts form the kernel of the strategies. Our representation formalism is similar to that proposed in <ref> [ Moore & Paris 89 ] </ref> . However, we introduce an additional slot for the medium. In doing so, we are able to define medium-independent presentation strategies as well as strategies that apply only for specific medium combinations. Examples of presentation strategies are shown below.

Reference-contexts: If the strategy is applied, the system (a) provides a unique description for ?rep-2 (main act) and (b) ensures that the user recognizes that this description and the corresponding image specify the same object (subsidiary act). For (a), we use a discrimination algorithm similar to the algorithm presented in <ref> [ Reiter & Dale 92 ] </ref> . However, we have investigated additional possibilities for distinguishing objects from their alternatives.

Many psychological and pedagogical studies focus on the various functions of pictures in illustrated documents (cf. <ref> [ Willows & Houghton 87; Houghton & Willows 87 ] </ref> ). Unfortunately, these studies only consider whole pictures, i.e., they do not address the question of how a picture is organized. <p> To prioritize presentation strategies, we use selection rules. For example, the selection rule below suggests the use of graphics rather than text when presenting spatial information. IF (Isa ?current-attribute-value SPATIAL-CONCEPT) THEN (TryBefore ?graphics-strategies? ?text-strategies?) Extended studies of relevant psychological literature (e.g., see <ref> [ Willows & Houghton 87; Houghton & Willows 87 ] </ref> ) and our own analyses of various illustrated documents form the basis of our selection rules and presentation strategies.
