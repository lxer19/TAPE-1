Title: Local Shape Approximation from Shading

Abstract: Shading can be used as an independent cue for exact shape recovery, or it can be used as a supplementary cue for shape interpolation between features, whose depth is known from other cues. Exact shape cannot be inferred from a local analysis of shading. However, for shape interpolation, a crude local approximation may be sufficient. This paper explores the limits of such local approximations that are easy to compute. In particular, the shape of shading is used to approximate the surface in areas of monotonic change of intensity. This analysis is accompanied by a method to compute the direction of a single point light source from the shading on occluding contours. A qualitative classification of shape near shading singularities is also discussed.

For example, there exist concave, convex and saddle-like surfaces that appear the same from certain viewpoints 2 .

Mutual illumination can severely degrade the accuracy of shape from shading algorithms (see <ref> [21] </ref> for an exception). On the other hand, mutual illumination can be used to detect other shape cues, such as occluding contours in shaded regions [11].

One such family is the locally-spherical surfaces, the only surfaces for which local shape from shading can be computed precisely <ref> [24] </ref>. In the case of such surfaces, and others, the shading is the shape, very little additional computation is required. For additional families of surfaces, the individual isophotes, or lines of equal brightness, are identical to the contour lines on the surface. <p> cues, such as motion or occluding contours, or set at an arbitrary constant, and the shading is then used to interpolate the depth between these features. 3.4 Discussion The approximation to shape by shading discussed here is in some sense a generalization of Pentland's analysis of local shape from shading <ref> [24] </ref>. Pentland showed that only spherical points can be precisely recovered with local shading analysis. The analysis in section 3 shows that local shading can be used to give the shape of a richer family of surfaces, not limited only to spherical. <p> In this section, direct computation of the light source direction from the shading on occluding contours in smoothly receding objects in the image is discussed (see also <ref> [5, 24, 25] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This section extends the work of Koenderink & van Doorn [17] and Yuille [33]. Yuille [33] has shown that at a parabolic point the isophote points along the line of curvature (or a principal direction) at the point (see also <ref> [31] </ref> for a similar result). He concluded that "typically the parabolic lines give rise to ridges, or valleys, in the image intensity". Analysis of surfaces of revolution shows that more often the isophotes are perpendicular, or almost perpendicular, to the parabolic line.

Yuille [33] has shown that at a parabolic point the isophote points along the line of curvature (or a principal direction) at the point (see also [31] for a similar result). He concluded that "typically the parabolic lines give rise to ridges, or valleys, in the image intensity". <p> In such cases it is still possible to learn some shape properties from the isophotes. This section extends the work of Koenderink & van Doorn [17] and Yuille <ref> [33] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the following, the computation of these two angles from shading on occluding contours and self-shadow edges is discussed. This computation is mostly based on a general shading model with Lambertian, ambient and specular components. 4.1 Tilt computation Zheng & Chellappa <ref> [34] </ref> have discussed the computation of the tilt of the illuminant from shading on occluding contours. Their scheme involves an integration of the shading information over the entire occluding contour.
