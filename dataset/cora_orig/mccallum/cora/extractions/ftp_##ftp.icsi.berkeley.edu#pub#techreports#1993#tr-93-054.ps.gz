Abstract: As high speed networks are starting to provide guaranteed performance service, it is imperative to revise fault recovery techniques to support this new service. In this paper we investigate one aspect of fault recovery in this context, the rerouting of guaranteed performance connections affected by link faults in the network. Recovery is achieved by rerouting the affected connection so as to avoid the failed link while ensuring that the traffic and performance guarantees made along the previous route are satisfied along the new route. The goal of the rerouting schemes is to reroute as much of the affected traffic as quickly and efficiently as possible. We investigate rerouting along the lines of two orthogonal components: the locus of reroute, which determines the node that does route selection and the new route selected; and the timing component, which determines when the individual reroute attempts are initiated. Within each of these two components we examine approaches that span the spectrum of that component. We compare all possible combinations of these approaches under a cross-section of network workloads, using in our comparisons a novel metric, the Queuing Delay Load Index, that captures both the bandwidth and delay resources required by a connection. Extensive simulation experiments were conducted on the various combinations and their results and hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Cooperative Agreement NCR-8919038 with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., Pacific Bell, the University of California under a MICRO grant, and the International Computer Science Institute.

The guaranteed service class is similar to that of the Tenet approach, however, the predictive service class does not meet our definition of guaranteed service communication as the service varies with the network load.

Reference-contexts: However, their fundamental similarity lead us to believe that most of the conclusions of this paper could apply to designing fault recovery schemes for most guaranteed service communication networks. Fault recovery has been studied under the context of telecommunication networks and conventional data networks. <ref> [6] </ref> presents the issues of fault recovery in telecommunication networks against a four layer model of the transport network: the switched layer, the cross-connect layer, the multiplex layer and the physical layer. The highest two layers are of the most interest. <p> Thus the techniques used in the telecommunication network such as solving linear programming problems or pre-computing configurations for each network state are not feasible. Fault recovery can be divided into the tasks of detection, instigation, rerouting and restorative reconfiguration <ref> [6] </ref>. In our opinion, the most difficult problems of failure recovery occur in the rerouting task. Our work will focus on the rerouting task. Rerouting has two aspects which are sensitive to time, and hence are of interest in the context of guaranteed performance service communication.
