Reference-contexts: Neutronics INEL has developed a neural network that uses the neutronic data for each barrel to determine if the pattern of measurements is consistent with the pattern typically seen with a particular matrix material <ref> (Becker et al. 1995) </ref>. This evidence can be either positive or negative for barrels that are thought to contain graphite.

Reference-contexts: Because uncertainty is such an important aspect of this problem, we have undertaken a comparative study of several methods for representing and reasoning with uncertainty in this domain. The methods under consideration are certainty factors <ref> (Buchanan and Shortliffe 1984) </ref>, Bayesian networks (Pearl 1988), Dempster-Shafer theory (Shafer 1976), and fuzzy logic (Zadeh 1965). This report presents a description of our preliminary results using Dempster-Shafer theory for waste characterization.

Reference-contexts: First, if the evidence is totally contradictory (i.e., one piece of evidence supports G completely and the other supports ~G completely) the rule of combination is not defined because it requires division by zero. Zadehs famous medical example <ref> (see Giarratano and Riley 1994) </ref> illustrates how the normalization process can result in counter intuitive results when processing highly contradictory evidence.

Reference-contexts: INEL is developing a Waste Assay Measurement Integration System (WAMIS) to improve confidence in and lower the uncertainty of waste characterization data <ref> (Mousseau 2 et al. 1995) </ref>. WAMIS will consist of two major components - a data access/visualization component and a data interpretation component. <p> WAMIS will consist of two major components - a data access/visualization component and a data interpretation component. The WAMIS data interpretation component will make use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to determine waste matrix and source material characteristics and the relationships among them to derive improved assays <ref> (Mousseau et al. 1995) </ref>. The system will act as an expert in the domain of nuclear waste characterization that can bring a wide variety of information to bear to determine the reliability of a characterization produced by a nondestructive analysis/nondestructive examination (NDA/NDE) assay system (or set of assay systems).

This report presents a description of our preliminary results using Dempster-Shafer theory for waste characterization. In particular, we have designed and implemented a small Dempster-Shafer system that addresses the first two decision points in Figure 1. <p> The major appeal of the theory is that it admits partially specified models and it is compatible with classical proof-based style of logical inference, sharing the syntax of deductive databases and logic programming <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref>. The two major concepts of Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory are the frame of discernment and the basic probability assignment (Stefik 1995). In D-S theory, the domain must be described using an exhaustive, mutually exclusive set of ground elements.

In D-S theory, the domain must be described using an exhaustive, mutually exclusive set of ground elements. The complete set of these elements form the frame of discernment denoted Q. In diagnosis systems this set of elements generally represents diagnostic hypotheses.
