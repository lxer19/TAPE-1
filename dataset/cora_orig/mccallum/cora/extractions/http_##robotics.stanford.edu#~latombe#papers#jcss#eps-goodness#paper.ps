Abstract: The subject of this paper is the analysis of a randomized preprocessing scheme that has been used for query processing in robot path planning. The attractiveness of the scheme stems from its general applicability to virtually any path-planning problem, and its empirically observed success. In this paper we initiate a theoretical basis for explaining this empirical success. Under a simple assumption about the configuration space, we show that it is possible to perform preprocessing following which queries can be answered quickly. En route, we consider related problems on graph connectivity in the evasiveness model, and art-gallery theorems.

For the purposes of this abstract, we also assume that the space is reflexive: if a point p 1 in free space is reachable from p 2 , then p 2 is reachable from p 1 . <p> both directions | from p 1 to p 2 , and from p 2 to p 1 | simultaneously.) A word about the random sampling in Step 1 of the preprocessing: in the experimental work [14, 15, 16, 28] this is done simply by choosing a point at random from <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d . If the chosen point is in the free space, it is retained; else it is discarded and the process repeated.

Reference-contexts: In this context, a recent research trend in motion planning has been the use of randomized preprocessing to obtain global completeness using only local computations in query processing. For example, Barraquand and Latombe <ref> [2] </ref> present an approach based on potential functions with the twist that Brownian motion (random walk) is used to escape from local minima. <p> One example of such a complex planner for general configuration spaces is due to Barraquand and Latombe <ref> [2] </ref>. Such an error-free planner may be extremely slow and may not be run to completion in practice.

Broder, Dyer, Frieze, Raghavan and Upfal <ref> [3] </ref> have initiated progress in extending the above result: they show that if * = 1=3 + ffi for a simply-connected region in the plane, the number of guards is polynomial in 1=ffi; they also give a bound for arbitrary spaces in which the number of guards grows with the diameter

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Planning obstacle-avoiding motion for a rigid or articulated robot from a given initial configuration to a goal configuration is an important problem in robotics <ref> [4, 19] </ref>. The set of feasible paths depends on the robot geometry, its motion capabilities and the workspace geometry. In many applications the environment is static and the robot must perform a series of complicated maneuvers to achieve a sequence of goals. <p> Specifically, Schwartz and Sharir [31] considered the setting where the d-dimensional configuration space contains a free space defined by n polynomial constraints of maximum degree 2 m; they presented an algorithm that is polynomial in n and m, but doubly-exponential in d. Canny <ref> [4] </ref> gave a different algorithm that is only singly-exponential in d. Thus, the practical impact of such methods has been restricted to the case of a small number of degrees of freedom, e.g., the motion planning problem for rigid robots in the plane with polygonal obstacles. <p> Joseph and Plantiga [11] established the PSPACE-hardness for planar arms, a sequence of links connected by revolute joints moving in the plane among polygonal obstacles. Similar results have been obtained for problems such as motion planning with moving obstacles <ref> [4, 30] </ref> and compliant motion planning with uncertainty [5]. In all these cases, the basic source of complexity appears to be the dramatic increase in the difficulty of the problem with increasing dimensionality. <p> Examples of this include the visibility graph approach of Nilsson [25] and the silhouette approach of Canny <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Joseph and Plantiga [11] established the PSPACE-hardness for planar arms, a sequence of links connected by revolute joints moving in the plane among polygonal obstacles. Similar results have been obtained for problems such as motion planning with moving obstacles <ref> [4, 30] </ref> and compliant motion planning with uncertainty [5]. In all these cases, the basic source of complexity appears to be the dramatic increase in the difficulty of the problem with increasing dimensionality.

Reference-contexts: This view led to the development of several planning methods all of which modeled obstacles as having low-degree algebraic surfaces, and reduced the planning problem to deciding the satisfiability of sentences in the first-order theory of reals. Specifically, Schwartz and Sharir <ref> [31] </ref> considered the setting where the d-dimensional configuration space contains a free space defined by n polynomial constraints of maximum degree 2 m; they presented an algorithm that is polynomial in n and m, but doubly-exponential in d. Canny [4] gave a different algorithm that is only singly-exponential in d. <p> One example of a global method is the technique of Schwartz and Sharir <ref> [31] </ref> that computes a cell decomposition of the free space and uses a search graph based on this decomposition.

Reference-contexts: The configuration space representation of a motion planning problem is due to Lozano-Perez [22, 23], although it was implicit in some earlier work <ref> [24, 32] </ref>. This representation is particularly amenable to an algebraic treatment of the problem, such as in terms of semi-algebraic sets [19]. A semi-algebraic set is a subspace of &lt; d defined by quantified first-order formulas over comparisons of polynomials with constants.
