Abstract: Physiological measurements like branch angles, branch lengths, branch diameters and branch cross-sectional area of the 3-D pulmonary tree structures are clinically essential in evaluating the function of normal and diseased lung and during the breathing process. In order to facilitate these measurements and study relative structural changes, the 3-D lung tree volumes are reduced to a 3-D Euclidean straight line central axis tree. The central axis tree captures the branch topology and geometric features of the tree volume. Since matching 3-D tree volumes is complex, as they change in branch topology and geometry, we accomplish it by designing an efficient algorithm that matches their corresponding central axis trees. The algorithm takes two binary central axis trees T 1 = (V 1 ; E 1 ; W 1 ) and T 2 = (V 2 ; E 2 ; W 2 ), where W 1 and W 2 are set of tuples containing geometric attributes corresponding to the nodes in T 1 and T 2 , as inputs and returns the one-to-one matching function f of nodes in T 1 to T 2 that preserves the tree topology and closely matches the geometric attributes of these trees i.e. branch points, branch lengths, and branch angles between mapped nodes of T 1 and T 2 . Since the topology match alone could result in many choices of the mapping function f , we prune these choices by incorporating constraints on the geometric attributes of nodes in T 1 and T 2 . We design a linear time algorithm that matches the branch topology and geometric features of T 1 and T 2 . Our algorithm produced accurate matchings on various airway data sets of a dog lung obtained from Computed Tomography under simulated breathing conditions. T 1 and T 2 are obtained by running a two-pass central axis algorithm on the tree volumes.

Reference-contexts: It aligns adjacent to the airway tree throughout, with the airway wall separating them. Using High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT), one can obtain multislice lung data sets. In this paper, we assume that the three tree structures are already segmented <ref> [3] </ref> from the lung volume.

Reference-contexts: We provide an algorithm to correspond dynamically varying 3-D tree volumes by matching their tree topology and geometry. Our approach involves matching CATs corresponding to these tree volumes. The CAT is computed from the 3-D tree volume using a robust central axis algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. We illustrate some of the difficulties involved in matching CATs (refer Fig. 1). The dotted arrows in Fig. 1 correspond to the mapping of nodes from T 1 to T 2 . <p> The organization of the paper is as follows: In section 2, we provide an overview of the central axis algorithm to compute the central axis tree from 3-D tree volume. The interested reader is referred to <ref> [4] </ref> for more details. In section 3, we provide a linear time algorithm that matches two central axis trees and in section 4 we provide the results of the matching algorithm on airway data sets of a dog lung obtained from HRCT at different pressures. <p> We conclude in section 5 looking at applying these algorithms for better segmentation of airways. 2. Central Axis Algorithm (CAA) The central axis algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> uses a two-pass region growing of the tree volume and obtains branch points by solving a non-linear optimization formulation. By connecting the branch points using the tree topology, we obtain the central axis tree. <p> Linear interpolation was used to obtain cubic voxel data. Each image stack contained around 170 images each of which is a 256x128 8-bit grayscale image (reduced from 16 bit HRCT data). We segmented the airway trees and ran the central axis algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> on them. The central axis tree obtained by joining the 3-D branch points is superimposed in Fig. 6 for the airway volume at 20cm of H 2 O pressure. We ran the central axis algorithm on airway volumes at all three pressures.

Reference-contexts: We provide a brief overview of lung physiology <ref> [5] </ref>. Each lobe of a lung has an airway tree which contains the air we breath, and vascular trees which contain blood. The airway tree is surrounded throughout by an airway wall which, in turn, is blood filled.

Reference-contexts: If we use the proximity of 3-D branch points in T 1 and T 2 as the minimization criteria, the Hausdorff distance metric <ref> [6] </ref> results in a many-to-one matching of nodes in T 1 to T 2 , but, we require a one-to-one matching.

Reference-contexts: Previous work on pulmonary tree volume correspondence <ref> [7] </ref> involved manual processing in order to compare their central axis tree representations. In [7], the tree volume was reduced to a CAT. Starting from the root, the edges of the CAT were appended with binary values (0 or 1) based on the cross-sectional area of the corresponding branch. <p> Previous work on pulmonary tree volume correspondence <ref> [7] </ref> involved manual processing in order to compare their central axis tree representations. In [7], the tree volume was reduced to a CAT. Starting from the root, the edges of the CAT were appended with binary values (0 or 1) based on the cross-sectional area of the corresponding branch. This results in a binary string sequence corresponding to each edge of the CAT. <p> This arises due to the limitations in the resolution of HRCT or due to improper segmentation of these new branches in the smaller tree volume. Hence, the CAT correspondences were done manually <ref> [7] </ref>. We provide an algorithm to correspond dynamically varying 3-D tree volumes by matching their tree topology and geometry. Our approach involves matching CATs corresponding to these tree volumes. The CAT is computed from the 3-D tree volume using a robust central axis algorithm [4]. <p> We are currently generating complex data sets of the central axis trees to incorporate bad situations (Fig. 5) which make the matching algorithm fail. This, in turn, helps develop new and more robust heuristics. It turns out that the PA trees are easier to segment than the airway trees <ref> [7] </ref> and since both airway and PA tree run in parallel all along the lung with similar branching structure, one can use the information provided by the extra edges in the CAT of the PA tree to identify missing airway branches.
