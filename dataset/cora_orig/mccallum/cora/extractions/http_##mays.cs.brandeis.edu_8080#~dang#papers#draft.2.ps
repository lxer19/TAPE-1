Title: Adaptivity and the Cohesive Nature of Hypertext Activity  
Author: Daniel Griffin 
Degree: Dissertation Proposal  
Date: February 14, 1997  
Abstract: In this proposal, I outline a direction of research into the use of the cohesive nature of activity within a hypertext environment. Most techniques for hypertext adaptivity rely upon the complex structuring of models of the domain and/or of the user(s). Research has shown that it is difficult to infer from user activity in a hypertext (whether by looking at locational or temporal factors). This research will be an attempt to characterize hypertext activity in clearer detail by looking at user activity at the level of activity cohesion. Using models built from this analysis, hypertext systems with the ability to recognize and adapt to user behavior will be built.

Reference-contexts: This proposal results from previous research concerning the adaption of systems based on the practice of using the system <ref> (Alterman and Griffin, 1996) </ref>. This adaptation based on practice, or use-adaption, is presently being studied for the purpose of improving online manuals and for `training' systems based on expert usage.

Reference-contexts: Navigation adaptations involve changing the appearance of navigational tools in the AH system. So, for example, systems can adapt to users' goals, knowledge and preferences by adding non-contextual links (links in the hypertext which are not "hotlinks") <ref> (Armstrong et al., 1995) </ref>, by sorting existing links according to relevance (Mathe and Chen, 1994), and by hiding and/or annotating links to give the user more information about "what's behind this door" (Brusilovsky and Pesin, 1995) (among other techniques). 4 Cohesion and Comprehension Given the above discussions of hypertext activity structure <p> Adding contextual links is simply the idea that all words in the text are potential links to other nodes, and that they all initially are hidden. 3. Add non-contextual links: Similar to other systems (e.g., <ref> (Armstrong et al., 1995) </ref>), links can be added to the nodes (in some form like a `Related Concepts' list) when the system sees it as necessary or desired. 4. Sort existing links: Non-contextual links that are used on a node can be sorted based on perceived user task/preference etc.

Similar analysis of text and hypertext systems (Foltz, 1996) has been done to measure the effects of increasing cohesion between hypertext "jumps" on comprehension.

Reference-contexts: Link hiding is generally done when the AH system believes that the user does not have the knowledge or desire to go through an existing link, so the link is removed (but not the word of the text to which the link was connected) <ref> (Brusilovsky, Pesin, and Zyryanov, 1993) </ref>. Adding contextual links is simply the idea that all words in the text are potential links to other nodes, and that they all initially are hidden. 3.

Reference-contexts: for further discussion of an adaptive hypertext system which has as its main strength, the ability to recognize and differentiate different hypertext episodes. 2 3 Adaptivity in Hypertext Given the above framework of hypertext activity, this section discusses research into making hyper media systems adaptive 2 As pointed out in <ref> (Brusilovsky, 1996) </ref> the typical model for an AH system includes the following: * A base hypertext or hypermedia system. * A user model. * The ability to adapt the hypermedia using the user model. 3.1 How Are Decisions to Adapt Made? In addition to the above mentioned parts of an AH <p> Passively acquired user models are generally considered unreliable because of the distance between the observable user actions (the user's path through the hyperspace and the time spent on a node in the hyperspace, in other words, the actemes) and the user's intent is either too great or too unclear <ref> (Brusilovsky, 1996) </ref>. The problem with passive user modeling can be seen as the problem of determining when episode emmergence occurs. Most AH systems today choose more active means of acquiring user information, mostly out of necessity, not choice. <p> This research will include a phase of active modeling in which empirical analysis of user hypertext activity will lead to an adaptive system capable of passive user modeling. 3.3 Types of Adaptations Adaptations fall into two main categories: Presentation adaptations and Navigation adaptations <ref> (Brusilovsky, 1996) </ref>. Presentation adaptations are done in AH systems which present different text to different users based upon their level of knowledge of the domain (e.g., (Boyle and Encarnation, 1994; Hook et al., 1996)). Navigation adaptations involve changing the appearance of navigational tools in the AH system. <p> episodes, and which do not? * Is this user exhibiting browsing or searching behavior? * Is the repetition of a node along a path an instance of a revisit or of a return? (is the user clarifying a point or backing up from a dead end?) As pointed out in <ref> (Brusilovsky, 1996) </ref> and elsewhere, there are only so many factors (actemes) that can be considered when anaylzing user behavior in a hypertext system.

Reference-contexts: In addition to giving information about user knowledge and goals, user models can give information about user preferences. User preferences are necessary to aid the reader of an AH system in navigating to areas of interest, Especially in large hyperspaces such as online help or documentation <ref> (Rabinowitz, Mathe, and Chen, 1995) </ref>, NetNews (Morita and Shinoda, 1994; Lang, 1995), or the World Wide Web (Armstrong et al., 1995; Yan et al., 1996).

Reference-contexts: For example, take a context-sensitive spreadsheet help system <ref> (Fox, Grunst, and Quast, 1994) </ref>. This system knows the what a user has been up to in the spreadsheet, and it can infer much from this context. This proposal follows this last line of research.

Reference-contexts: In general, measures of time spent on a node can be used as an indicator of relevance of or user interest in that node. This time can also be normalized for information content of that node <ref> (Kaplan and Fenwick, 1993) </ref>. A threshold can also used to try to estimate `when' a node becomes relevant to the user (Vassileva, 1996). With or without this threshold, there is an inherent problem that an open-ended maximun of time spent on a node introduces.

Reference-contexts: Such an upper bound on time to determine different hypertext sessions has been used in (Yan et al., 1996). Similarly, others have looked at the role of the number of semantic propositions in a text in relation to reading rate <ref> (Kintsch and Keenan, 1973) </ref>. I would expect that interest or relevance of a node as a function of time spent on that node would appear somewhat like with the shaded area representing the interval of interest, so to speak.

Reference-contexts: One would expect that the number of necessary bridging inferences correlates with the level understandability, giving an indication of the level of expertise of the user. Predictions of comprehension based on the coherence of the text can therefore be made (e.g., <ref> (Miller and Kintsch, 1980) </ref>), and these predictions can also be used to improve texts (e.g., (Britton and Gulgoz, 1991; Foltz, 1996)). 4.2.2 Example For a better example of creating a coherency graph, consider the following example taken from (Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978): Given the following text (incomplete for brevity): A
