Reference-contexts: These sets of metaphoric associations, along with the concepts that comprise the source and target domains, were represented using the kodiak (Wilensky, 1986) representation language. kodiak is an extended semantic network language in the tradition of kl-one <ref> (Brachman and Schmolze, 1985) </ref> and its variants. These sets of metaphoric associations are full-fledged kodiak concepts. As such, they can be related to other concepts and arranged in abstraction hierarchies using the inheritance mechanisms provided by kodiak.

Reference-contexts: Ontolingua is intended to be used to represent and distribute common ontologies. It supports a canonical format which can be translated into a number of common representation systems including loom <ref> (Brill, 1992) </ref>. Facilities are also provided for the creation of generators for other representation systems like kodiak. Ontolingua is based on the kif knowledge interchange format (Genesereth and Fikes, 1992).

Reference-contexts: At the same time, however, these approaches have all avoided simplistic phrasal or word-sense approaches that neither adequately capture generalizations nor allow for novel cases. Finally, like midas, they all use small knowledge-bases of conventions with minimal coverage and little empirical validation. (Hinkleman's corpora-based <ref> (Hinkelman, 1990) </ref> research is a notable exception to this). The following discussion presents an overview of how this general approach has been applied to the problem of conventional metaphor.

Reference-contexts: If a word sense can safely be predicted from the spatial or physical meaning of the word combined with a known metaphor then the sense need not be listed in the lexicon. 7.2 Common-Sense Knowledge-Bases CYC (Lenat and Guha, 1990) and Tacitus <ref> (Hobbs et al., 1987) </ref> are two major recent efforts to construct large common-sense knowledge-bases.

Reference-contexts: Under this knowledge-based approach, the way to approach the study of metaphor is to study the underlying details of individual metaphors, and systems of metaphors in the language. This approach follows on the metaphor work of Lakoff and Johnson <ref> (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) </ref> and builds directly on the knowledge-based computational approaches to metaphor of Jacobs and Norvig (Jacobs, 1985; Norvig, 1987). <p> The second pertains to how we go about hunting for metaphors in a large corpus. 4.2.1 Conventional Metaphor Analysis We are interested in the kind of common-place conventional metaphor introduced by Reddy (Reddy, 1979) and elaborated on by Lakoff and Johnson <ref> (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) </ref> among many others. These are common-place uses of words and phrases that depart from their literal meanings in ways that systematically indicate that one concept is being thought of and spoken about in terms of another concept of a different kind.

Reference-contexts: We believe that a robust MetaBank would largely alleviate this problem with lexicons. If a word sense can safely be predicted from the spatial or physical meaning of the word combined with a known metaphor then the sense need not be listed in the lexicon. 7.2 Common-Sense Knowledge-Bases CYC <ref> (Lenat and Guha, 1990) </ref> and Tacitus (Hobbs et al., 1987) are two major recent efforts to construct large common-sense knowledge-bases.

Reference-contexts: The most straightforward way of acquiring such information would be to do an exhaustive metaphor analysis of each sentence in the corpus. Indeed such exhaustive analyses have been performed for the purpose of determining the overall frequency of metaphor and metonymy in a wide variety of corpora <ref> (Pollio et al., 1990) </ref>. These studies have found that these phenomena appear quite frequently, averaging around 5 uses per 100 words of text. <p> corpus? * What metaphors occur in this corpus? 19 * What is the relative frequency of these metaphors? * How many metaphors are there? 6.1 Overall Frequency of Metaphor Our sampling results are largely in agreement with the frequency results previously obtained through exhaustive analyses of a variety of English <ref> (Pollio et al., 1990) </ref> texts. Our sample produced 515 instances of metaphors out of 581 sampled sentences containing 11925 words of text.

Reference-contexts: The first pertains to the method of analyzing individual sentences used to identify underlying conventional metaphors. The second pertains to how we go about hunting for metaphors in a large corpus. 4.2.1 Conventional Metaphor Analysis We are interested in the kind of common-place conventional metaphor introduced by Reddy <ref> (Reddy, 1979) </ref> and elaborated on by Lakoff and Johnson (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) among many others.

Reference-contexts: In this example, the source component of the metaphor is attached to the concept of being enclosed, not to the lexical item in. These sets of metaphoric associations, along with the concepts that comprise the source and target domains, were represented using the kodiak <ref> (Wilensky, 1986) </ref> representation language. kodiak is an extended semantic network language in the tradition of kl-one (Brachman and Schmolze, 1985) and its variants. These sets of metaphoric associations are full-fledged kodiak concepts.

Reference-contexts: Among the research projects following this general approach are Zernik's rina system (phrasal idioms) <ref> (Zernik, 1987) </ref>, Fass's meta5 system (metaphor and metonymy) (Fass, 1988; Fass, 1991), and Hinkelman's system (indirect speech acts) (Hinkelman, 1989; Hinkelman and Allen, 1989). These systems all attempt to leverage knowledge of systematic language conventions in an attempt to avoid resorting to more computationally expensive methods.

Reference-contexts: This plot shows that a small number of metaphors account for a large number of instances, with the curve tailing off significantly to extremely low frequency metaphors. It appears, therefore, that the conventional metaphors in this corpus closely follow the Zipf's Law <ref> (Zipf, 1949) </ref> behavior observed in so many domains. This Zipf-like behavior has potential implications for both computational and psychological processing models of metaphor understanding.
