Title: The Minimum Equivalent DNF Problem and Shortest Implicants complete, and p 2 -hard to approximate

Abstract: We prove that the Minimum Equivalent DNF problem is p 2 -complete, resolving a conjecture due to Stockmeyer. The proof involves as an intermediate step a variant of a related problem in logic minimization, namely, that of finding the shortest implicant of a Boolean function. We also obtain certain results concerning the complexity of the Shortest Im-plicant problem that may be of independent interest. When the input is a formula, the Shortest Implicant problem is p

Reference-contexts: Our result for SHORTEST IMPLI CANT [DNF] should be contrasted with the proof in <ref> [1] </ref> that the Boolean Isomorphism problem cannot be p 2 -complete unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Our conditional collapse is weaker; to show a full PH collapse if SHORTEST IMPLICANT [DNF] is p 2 -complete would likely involve new general results on the power of limited non-determinism. 2.

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider the computational complexity of the shortest implicant problem, although variants of the problem are similar to certain circuit subfunction relation problems shown to be 2 -complete in <ref> [2] </ref>. Our result for SHORTEST IMPLI CANT [DNF] should be contrasted with the proof in [1] that the Boolean Isomorphism problem cannot be p 2 -complete unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.

Reference-contexts: This class (also called fi 2 ) is explored in [7], [5] and <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Several related open problems remain. It would be interesting to precisely classify the complexity of SHORTEST IMPLICANT [DNF] (i.e. show completeness for some complexity class). The appropriate class may be NP [log 2 or it may be a class analogous to the LOGNP class defined in <ref> [10] </ref>. Any approximability or inapproximability results for MIN DNF might yield insight into the best ways to attack this real-world problem. Similar results for some of the simpler optimization problems involving shortest impli-cants might be a useful starting point.
