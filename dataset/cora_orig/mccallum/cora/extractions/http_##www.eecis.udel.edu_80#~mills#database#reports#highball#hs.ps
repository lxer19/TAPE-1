Reference-contexts: The fact that data paths can be wide and propagation delays small leads to straightforward architectures using centralized control and multi-wire, point-to-point transmission links. An example of current fast LAN technology is the High Speed Point to Point Interconnect (HPPI) architecture and protocol <ref> [ANS90] </ref>. In HPPI data are transmitted in blocks of 32- or 64-bit words using a connection-mode protocol operating at speeds up to 1.6 Gbps. Wide area networks are usually constructed over dedicated or common-carrier transmission facilities.

Reference-contexts: These channels are then cross-connected and aggregated over multiplexed transmission facilities operating at rates to 2.4 Gbps. In future, it is likely that long distance, high speed digital networks will be constructed directly from the transmission facilities and interconnected with switching equipment using SONET <ref> [BEL88] </ref> interfaces operating at discrete rates from 51 Mbps (OC-1) to 2.4 Gbps (OC-48) in increments of 51 Mbps. Current common-carrier digital networks operate in synchronous mode, where all network clocks are synchronized at the same 125-m s frame interval.

Reference-contexts: The network design described in this report is based on an electronic crossbar switch assembled using specially designed VLSI chips fabricated using MOSIS and inexpensive 2-micron technology <ref> [DAV90] </ref>. While these devices are presently limited to 25 Mbps, it is expected that devices operating at speeds beyond 100 Mbps can be readily fabricated using other technologies at acceptable cost.

Reference-contexts: While the technology discussed in this report is believed new and subject to review and change as development proceeds, it should be recognized that many of the ideas embodied in the scheduling and synchronization algorithms have evolved from prior work, most notably the DARPA Packet Satellite Projects (SATNET and WIDEBAND <ref> [HA86] </ref>), Multiple Satellite System (MSS), the NASA Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) and the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [MIL90c]. 1.1. Overview The Highball Project is a research effort designed to specify and ultimately build a fast, wide area network.

McRoberts. </author> <title> Switched multimegabit data service and early availability via MAN technolgy. </title> <journal> IEEE Communications Magazine 26, </journal> <month> 4 (April </month> <year> 1988), </year> <pages> 9-15. </pages>
Reference-contexts: SONET interfaces operate in a fixed configuration (i.e., not switched on either a circuit or a frame basis). At low and medium speeds up to perhaps 150 Mbps (STS-3) for a single user, packetswitching access technologies, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Synchronous Metropolitan Data System (SMDS) <ref> [HEM88] </ref>, are appropriate for conventional interactive-access and bulk-transfer network services. For unconventional applications at speeds much above 150 Mbps for a single user, packetswitching technologies may not be the best choice.

Reference-contexts: There is a spectrum of algorithms that could be used from nondeterministic distributed ALOHA algorithms to receiver-directed algorithms such as proposed for MSS and deterministic centralized reservation algorithms similar to those used in SATNET/WIDEBAND <ref> [JAC77] </ref>. It is even possible to operate the network on a store-and-forward basis by staging transmissions in the node controllers themselves. However, the most interesting and useful algorithms are distributed R-TDMA algorithms similar to the PODA algorithm used in the SATNET and WIDEBAND satellite systems.

Reference-contexts: If retransmission (ARQ) methods are used, rather than forwarderror-correction (FEC) methods, a sender may have to buffer over seven megabytes of data between initial transmission and arrival of the acknowledgement. Proposed FEC transmission methods <ref> [MCA90] </ref> take advantage of the fact that fiber digital networks may suffer far fewer errors than older technologies; however, protocols designed for LAN internetworking, such as SMDS, are designed to drop packets under conditions of heavy load, which might easily overwhelm these methods.

Reference-contexts: The entire network must agree on the clock phase to within about one microsecond, while delays between nodes must be known as accurately. We believe the network clocks can be made this accurate using the methodology of NTP <ref> [MIL90a] </ref>, which has recently been extended for just this purpose. 1.2. Traffic Models Most traffic carried on existing interconnected networks such as the Internet consists of some variants of interactive terminal, bulk-data transfer or remote-procedure-call applications.

Reference-contexts: An appropriate mechanism for synchronizing the network may be NTP, which involves the exchange 10 of timestamps over the network and the adjustment of precision frequency and time references <ref> [MIL90b] </ref>. 2.2. Scheduling Algorithms We are investigating many paradigms for scheduling bursts and believe that two are most promising. <p> This is not believed to be a severe problem using the principles described in the Network Time Protocol Version 3 <ref> [MIL90b] </ref>, which was specially designed for these applications. NTP assumes a local-clock model based on an adaptive-parameter, type-II phase-lock loop. For the purposes required here, the NTP local-clock model can be applied directly, with incremental phase adjustments made by adjusting the master clock frequency.

Reference-contexts: Other examples in which R-TDMA technology may be used effectively include space science and surveillance. The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), which uses satellite-switched TDMA (SS-TDMA) and transponders that operate up to several hundred Mbps, would appear to be an ideal candidate for this technology. The Space Station <ref> [SMI90] </ref> is to operate using 3 a 300-Mbps space-ground link multiplexed for telemetry, video and voice.
