Title: Constructing Small Sample Spaces Satisfying Given Constraints  
Author: Daphne Koller Nimrod Megiddo 
Keyword: discrete probability distribution, linear programming, algorithm, sample space, derandomization, hypergraph, independent set, probabilistic constraint satisfaction, independent random variables.  
Abstract: The subject of this paper is finding small sample spaces for joint distributions of n discrete random variables. Such distributions are often only required to obey a certain limited set of constraints of the form Pr(Event) = . We show that the problem of deciding whether there exists any distribution satisfying a given set of constraints is NP-hard. However, if the constraints are consistent, then there exists a distribution satisfying them which is supported by a "small" sample space (one whose cardinality is equal to the number of constraints). For the important case of independence constraints, where the constraints have a certain form and are consistent with a joint distribution of independent random variables, a small sample space can be constructed in polynomial time. This last result can be used to derandomize algorithms; we demonstrate this by an application to the problem of finding large independent sets in sparse hypergraphs.

Reference-contexts: The probability space associated with these variables is = f0; : : : ; r 1g n . A distribution is a map f : ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that P x2 f (x) = 1. We define the set S (f ) = fx 2 j f (x) &gt; 0g to be the sample space of f . <p> Moreover, it suffices to search any subset of S (f ) that is guaranteed to contain a good point for each possible input. Adleman <ref> [1] </ref> shows that for any distribution f used in an algorithm in RP, there exists a space S 0 S (f ) of polynomial size that contains a good point for every possible input. The proof of this fact is not constructive, and therefore cannot be used to derandomize algorithms.

Reference-contexts: It was later derandomized also for d = O (polylog n) by Berger and Rompel [7] and Motwani, Naor, and Naor [14]. We show how this algorithm can be derandomized for any d. A sequential deterministic polynomial time solution for the independent set problem in hypergraphs exists <ref> [2] </ref>. However, the derandomization of this algorithm using our technique serves to demonstrate its unique power. 6 Moreover, as we have observed, Schulman's construction works only for random bits. 5 Algorithm 1: Reduction to Basic Solutions While fA flj : j 2 S (v)g are linearly dependent: 1. <p> This is the problem of finding large independent sets in sparse hypergraphs.

Reference-contexts: Most of the previous work has focussed on constructing approximations to such distributions. Joffe [10] first demonstrated a construction of a joint distribution of n d-wise independent uniformly-distributed random variables with a sample space of cardinality O ((2n) d ). Luby [13] and Alon, Babai, and Itai <ref> [3] </ref> show how Joffe's construction can be generalized to allow for non-uniform distributions using sample spaces of essentially the same cardinality. <p> In Section 4 we show an example of how our technique can be applied to derandomiza-tion of algorithms. We discuss the problem of finding a large independent set in a d-uniform hypergraph. The underlying randomized algorithm, described by Alon, Babai, and Itai <ref> [3] </ref>, was derandomized in the same paper for fixed values of d. It was later derandomized also for d = O (polylog n) by Berger and Rompel [7] and Motwani, Naor, and Naor [14]. We show how this algorithm can be derandomized for any d. <p> For the sake of simplicity and for ease of comparison, we will base our analysis on a single problem. This is the problem of finding large independent sets in sparse hypergraphs. The problem description and the randomized algorithm for its solution are taken from Alon, Babai, and Itai <ref> [3] </ref>. Note that a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem is known [2]. <p> A subset U V is said to be independent if it contains no edge. Consider the randomized Algorithm 2 (k will be defined later). The following theorem, due to Alon, Babai, and Itai <ref> [3] </ref>, states that this algorithm finds "large" independent sets in hypergraphs with "high" probability. We only sketch the proof of this theorem, concentrating on the part that is relevant to this discussion: the constraints on the distribution assumed by the proof. <p> This has probability at least Pr (fY &lt; kg " fX 2kg) &gt; 2 3 ; as desired. Derandomization I The derandomization procedure of Alon, Babai, and Itai <ref> [3] </ref> is based on constructing a joint distribution of d-wise independent variables X i that approximates the joint d-wise independent distribution for which Pr (X i = 1) = 3k=n (i = 1; : : : ; n). <p> For fixed d, this number is polynomial in n, resulting in a sample space of polynomial size (in fact, the size of the sample space is comparable to the one achieved in <ref> [3] </ref>). Therefore, the algorithm runs in polynomial time, including both the phase of constructing the sample space and the phase of running Step 2 of Algorithm 2 on each point of this space until a sufficiently large independent set is found. <p> This algorithm therefore applies to a larger class of graphs than the one presented by Alon, Babai, and Itai <ref> [3] </ref>. At first glance, it seems that as we have polynomially many neighborhoods of logarithmic size, Schulman's technique [17] can also be used in this case. However, his approach is limited to (uniformly distributed) random bits so it does not apply to this algorithm. <p> In particular, it may be possible to construct approximate distributions faster, or in parallel (see [11]), or over smaller sample spaces. We note that the original d-wise independent constructions <ref> [3, 10, 13] </ref> precisely satisfy the d-wise independence constraints but approximately satisfy the constraints on the value of Pr (X i = b). In contrast, the nearly-independent constructions [4, 5, 9, 15] approximately satisfy the d-wise independence constraints.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we obtain a polynomial-size sample space that is nearly d-wise independent for d = O (log n) (as compared to the lower bound of (n log n ) for truly d-wise independent sample spaces).

Finally, Even et. al [9] presented constructions for nearly independent distributions over non-uniform non-binary random variables. <p> Our construction has a number of advantages. First, the distributions generated always satisfy the constraints precisely. Thus, the correctness proof of the algorithm need not be modified.

Reference-contexts: Throughout the algorithm, S (v) denotes the set of indices fj : v j &gt; 0g. Intuitively, these indices represent points in the sample space of the distribution represented by v. Algorithm 1 is described in full detail by Beling and Megiddo <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> Thus, g ` satisfies requirements 1 and 2, but may not satisfy requirement 3. But g ` is a nonnegative solution to the system of linear equations defined by ` (C). Therefore, we may use Algorithm 1 or the algorithm of Beling and Megiddo <ref> [6] </ref> to reduce the cardinality of the sample space to c, as described in Section 2. Let f ` be the resulting distribution. It clearly satisfies all three requirements. We thus obtain the following theorem: Theorem 3..2.
