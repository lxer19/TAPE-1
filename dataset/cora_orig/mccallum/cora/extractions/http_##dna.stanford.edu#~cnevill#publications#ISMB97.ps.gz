Abstract: Discrete motifs that discriminate functional classes of proteins are useful for classifying new sequences, capturing structural constraints, and identifying protein subclasses. Despite the fact that the space of such motifs can grow exponentially with sequence length and number, we show that in practice it usually does not, and we describe a technique that infers motifs from aligned protein sequences by exhaustively searching this space. Our method generates sequence motifs over a wide range of recall and precision, and chooses a representative motif based on a score that we derive from both statistical and information-theoretic frameworks. Finally, we show that the selected motifs perform well in practice, classifying unseen sequences with extremely high precision, and infer protein subclasses that correspond to known biochemical classes.

Reference-contexts: As output, EMOTIF generates a graphical display of possible motifs in the style of PROSITE <ref> (Bairoch, 1991) </ref>. The motifs discussed here take the form of allowable amino acids for certain positions in a subsequence. Rather than permitting an arbitrary set of amino acids in each position, we prescribe a small number of sets that correspond to some biochemical property, such as charge or size.

Reference-contexts: E M O T I F is an extension of the SEQCLASS system described by Wu and Brutlag (1995), and is available at http://motif.stanford.edu/emotif As input, EMOTIF expects a multiple alignment such as those from the BLOCKS database <ref> (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1991) </ref>, which typically contains sequences from active sites where sequence homology stems from functional constraints. As output, EMOTIF generates a graphical display of possible motifs in the style of PROSITE (Bairoch, 1991).

Reference-contexts: This is wasteful, however, because there are 32 five-bit codes, of which only 20 are used. When several symbols are being transmitted, it is possible to transmit a symbol in a nonintegral number of bits using arithmetic coding <ref> (Witten et al., 1987) </ref>, so this could be reduced to log 2 20, or 4.3 bits. This transmission uses the same number of bits for each amino acid, regardless of whether it is a common amino acid such as leucine, or a very uncommon one such as cysteine.

Reference-contexts: The disjunction of these motifs matches three kinds of tubulins, while maintaining high specificity relative to a single motif that covered the same set. Furthermore, if the subclasses were biologically unknown, this process might provide some insights about function. 6 Conclusions We have extended SEQCLASS <ref> (Wu and Brutlag, 1995) </ref> in five ways. First, by using the concept of a canonical motif, and by observing that there are typically a much smaller number of such motifs than the exponential worst-case bounds suggest, EMOTIF is capable of enumerating all motifs, obviating arbitrary pruning of the search space.
