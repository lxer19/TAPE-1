Abstract: Recent attention to using case-based reasoning for intelligent fault diagnosis has led to the development of very large, complex databases of diagnostic cases. The performance of case-based reasoners is dependent upon the size of the case base such that as case bases increase in size, it is usually reasonable to expect accuracy to improve but computational performance to degrade. Given one of these large case bases, it is advantageous to attempt to induce structure from the case base whereby the diagnostic process can be made more efficient. In addition, certainty properties of case based reasoning make fault diagnosis difficult, in which case inducing structure and applying a method for reasoning under uncertainty becomes advantageous. In this chapter, we discuss an approach to analyzing a diagnostic case base and inducing a compact knowledge base using the diagnostic inference model with which efficient diagnostics can be performed. We then apply an approach to reasoning using Dempster-Shafer theory to improve the diagnostics using the resultant model.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, with a proper model, high confidence tests, and a reasonable fault universe, many faults will be identified in this manner. For illustration purposes, we will use a simple digital circuit <ref> (Abramovici, Breuer, and Friedman, 1990) </ref>. This circuit is given in Figure 2. From this figure and assuming a singlestuck-at fault model, we can identify 26 possible stuck-at faults. <p> These ambiguity groups, which were taken from <ref> ( Abramovici et al. , 1990) </ref> are shown in Table 1. <p> Given the single stuck-at fault model, we assume the circuit simulation accurately reflects the performance of the actual circuit. In other words, we 3 The previous set of ambiguities was constructed assuming all of the test vectors were available. This analysis was performed using a fault-collapsing technique <ref> ( Abramovici et al. 1990) </ref>. However, as we see, d 1 and i 1 are also inherently ambiguous, as are g 1 and j 1 , illustrating that fault collapsing is not sufficient for robust ambiguity analysis. Table 2. <p> We claim that applying the nearest neighbor classification method to outcome-based diagnosis such as that used with most case-based reasoners and fault dictionaries leads to ineffective diagnostics and, thereby, ineffective repair. In fact, we find in <ref> ( Abramovici et al. , 1990) </ref> that the following problems are already known to exist in using fault dictionaries. First, the computational 88 Chapter 5 requirements for computing fault dictionaries is quite high, making generating a dictionary for a large circuit with long test sequences expensive.

Reference-contexts: These approaches are analogous to determining which tests to include in the fault dictionary and form a method of compressing the dictionary along the test axis. Inducing Diagnostic Inference Models from Case Data 87 In the pattern recognition literature <ref> ( Dasarathy, 1991) </ref>, approaches to reducing the size of the instance base that more closely relate to the common fault dictionary compression methods are known as editing methods.

Reference-contexts: These compression techniques are analogous to the problem of selecting relevant features in pattern recognition. The two most common approaches to feature selection are stepwise forward selection and stepwise backward selection <ref> (Devijver and Kittler, 1982) </ref>. In stepwise forward selection, features are added until classification accuracy begins to degrade, and the features are selected incrementally based on maximizing classification accuracy. In stepwise backward selection, features are removed using the same criteria.

Reference-contexts: Early work by Wilson (1972) showed that examples could be removed from a set used for classification and suggested that simply editing would frequently improve classification accuracy (in the same way that pruning improves decision trees <ref> ( Mingers, 1989) </ref>). Wilsons algorithm classifies each example in a data set with its own k nearest neighbors. Those points that are incorrectly classified are deleted from the instance base, the idea being that such points probably represent noise.

Reference-contexts: DIAGNOSIS WITH DIAGNOSTIC INFERENCE MODELS In Chapter 6, we discuss using a diagnostic inference model (also called an information flow model) to capture relationships between test outcomes and diagnoses <ref> (Sheppard and Simpson, 1998) </ref>. The concept of the diagnostic inference model is closely related to the fault dictionary, except that it abstracts the concepts of a test and a fault to address testing at the system level (Sheppard and Simpson, 1991; Simpson and Sheppard, 1994). <p> Because of the inherent linked 102 Chapter 5 difficulties in processing erroneous test data in these approaches, we developed two alternative approaches to processing this data which are presented in Chapter 6 <ref> (Sheppard and Simpson, 1998) </ref>. The alternatives consider test results as evidence for or against the presence of a fault in the system. Test results are processed sequentially, and the evidence supporting or denying the presence of a failure mode is attributed to the set of failure modes in the system.

Reference-contexts: These approaches are based on the Dempster-Shafer method for reasoning under uncertainty ( Dempter, 1968; Shafer, 1976) and certainty factors as incorporated in the MYCIN system <ref> (Shortliffe, 1976) </ref>. In related research, Denux (1995) attempted to overcome some of the drawbacks of the nearest neighbor classification rule and proposed a modification to k-nearest neighbor using Dempster-Shafer.
