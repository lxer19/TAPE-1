Reference-contexts: Note: The latter property is less useful than it may appear, unless there is a guarantee of agent reliability as well. Such a guarantee is a policy issue, and may vary among systems but it is important (as an assumption) for the semantic description presented in <ref> [3] </ref> This abstraction may be implemented in many ways. For example, the links could be TCP/IP connections over the Internet, which may only actually exist during the transmission of a single message or groups of messages. The links could be email paths used by mail-enabled programs. <p> C :in-reply-to id3 :reply-with id6 :language KQML :ontology kqml-ontology :content (tell :receiver C :language Prolog :ontology foo :content "bar (X,Y)" )) The :from of the forward, which is also the value of the :sender of the tell, is omitted for reasons that are made clear in the semantic description (see <ref> [3] </ref>). A proposal for a new KQML specification 37 The constraint is that performative name be one of the performatives that can be used in advertise (see page 19). <p> Such an action initiates a sub-dialogue with another facilitator in order to serve the original query. Elaborate protocols of this kind are examples of conversations (interactions) that be built on top of the conversation policies presented in <ref> [3] </ref> * Facilitators may request the services of other facilitators in the same way that regular agents may request the services of their facilitator. Facilitators do not advertise, not even to other facilitators.
