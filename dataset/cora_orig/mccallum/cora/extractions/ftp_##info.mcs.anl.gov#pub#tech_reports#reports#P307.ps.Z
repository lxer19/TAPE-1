Abstract: The Ginzburg-Landau equations we study arise in the modeling of superconductivity. One widely used method of discretizing the equations together with the associated periodic boundary conditions, in the case of a rectangle of dimension 2, leads to a five-point stencil. Solving the system means inverting a sparse matrix of dimension N 2 , where N is the number of grid points on each side of the rectangle. We propose a method that is similar to the shooting technique in the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. For small N , the method requires inverting a full matrix of dimension 2N . When N is large, an iterative procedure combining partial sweeping and the technique of divide and conquer (domain decomposition) is appropriate.

Reference-contexts: Even though in 1959 Gor'kov [14] was able to derive the Ginzburg-Landau model from the more fundamental BCS (Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer <ref> [2] </ref>) microscopic theory, some idealization and approximations are adopted in the derivation. For example, the temperature is assumed to be close to T c , and the spatial variations of and A are slow.

Reference-contexts: Plassmann and Wright employ an iterative algorithm (nested within each Newton step) for this purpose. In theory, our approach inverts the Ginzburg-Landau operator directly, using an idea borrowed from the shooting method for solving ordinary differential equations; see, for example, <ref> [3] </ref>. We reduce the problem to the inversion of a (full) 2N fi 2N matrix. The inverse Ginzburg-Landau image of any given matrix can then be found without the explicit construction of the inverse of the Ginzburg-Landau operator. For small N , the method works beautifully.

Reference-contexts: A major disadvantage of using (2.14) is that the discretized form of the gauge invariance is only approximately satisfied. Two gauge-equivalent pairs do not necessarily yield identical values for G d . To remedy this, gauge field theorists have long been using a different approximation (see <ref> [4] </ref>) for the kinetic energy term: G = N 2 0 1 j j 4 + fi fi ! e iAh x fi fi fi + fi fi " e iBh y fi fi fi + fi fi fi h y B !

Reference-contexts: It then follows that the error can only converge to zero. The idea of the method is definitely not new. It can be traced back, for example, to the method of balayage of Poincare (see <ref> [6] </ref>) in proving the existence of a solution to the Laplace equation. A theoretical proof of convergence is, of course, not a guarantee for convergence in a numerical implementation; as usual, rounding errors can cause trouble.

Reference-contexts: A brief discussion of the Ginzburg-Landau theory and the discretization method will be given in Section 2. Numerical methods that have been tried on two-dimensional cases include simulated annealing <ref> [8] </ref> and relaxation [19] [16] (which is equivalent to solving a time-dependent version of the Ginzburg-Landau equations using a forward Euler scheme of integration). Although these methods are easy to understand and to implement, they are not efficient and require an enormous amount of computer time. <p> The latter is indeed a more commonly used form of the functional; see, for example, [9].

For our purpose, (2.2) is more convenient since the constant will not appear in the variational equation governing , which is the main object of our discussion in this paper. Instead, appears in the differential equation governing A; it affects indirectly through the coupling of the equations. <p> A thorough explanation of the implication of this statement can be found in [10]. Even after taking the gauge invariance into consideration, there is still some arbitrariness in choosing the boundary conditions. We follow Doria, Gubernatis, and Rainer <ref> [8] </ref> in using the so-called quasi-periodic boundary conditions. To be more specific, we take to be the rectangle [0; L x ] fi [0; L y ] which contains n vortices, and assume that A = (A; B; 0) has essentially only two components. <p> Note that our conditions are different from those in <ref> [8] </ref>, but only because we have made a 90 degree rotation in orientation. We find that the computer code is easier to write with this modification. Du, Gunzburger, and Peterson in [10] used as the core domain, , a parallelogram formed by the centers of four vortices.

Not only is the resolution coarse, but the size of the domains is unrealistically small in order to limit the number of vortices.

The approach used by Garner et al. in <ref> [12] </ref> is based on a conjugate gradient technique in optimization theory, but the nature of each iterative step is similar to that described above and involves the inversion of a linear system that encompasses the discrete Ginzburg-Landau operator.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The term Ginzburg-Landau equations has been applied to several sets of differential equations arising in diversified applications. The mathematical properties of the various sets, however, can differ widely. The particular equations we are interested in here were proposed by Ginzburg and Landau <ref> [13] </ref> in 1950 to model the phenomenon of superconductivity. They are derived as the first variational equations for the minimization of a certain free energy functional. One of the important goals of research is the understanding of the behavior of solutions satisfying given boundary conditions. <p> He also observed that, while at a temperature below T c , a sufficiently large external magnetic field could revert the metal from the superconducting state to the normal state. Ginzburg and Landau in 1950 <ref> [13] </ref> explained the phenomenon as a new type of phase transition, similar to the familiar solid-liquid or liquid-gas phase change of matter.

Reference-contexts: One must bear in mind, however, that the Ginzburg-Landau theory was first proposed as a phenomenological model, implying that its ultimate validity depends on the agreement of theoretical and experimental results. Even though in 1959 Gor'kov <ref> [14] </ref> was able to derive the Ginzburg-Landau model from the more fundamental BCS (Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer [2]) microscopic theory, some idealization and approximations are adopted in the derivation.
