Abstract: is specified by a triple of linear maps A : R n ! R n , B : R m ! R n , and C : R n ! R p so that, for each "input" !, F(!)(t) = C~(t), where the state ~ is the solution of the initial value problem ~ 0 (t) A~(t) = B!(t), ~(0) = 0. The study of representability and the analysis of qualitative properties of minimal realizations has its roots in the nineteenth century, in particular in the work of Lord Kelvin regarding the use of integrators for solving differential equations, Kronecker's contributions to linear algebra (to a great extent motivated by essentially these questions), and Hurwitz' and Routh's stability criteria. The theory, which is at the core of modern multivariable linear control, achieved full development mainly during the 1960s. Standard textbooks (e.g. [21]) cover this material, which forms the basis of widely used computer-aided design packages. Much effort has been directed since the early 1970s towards extensions to nonlinear operators, including the characterization of representability by means of explicit numerical invariants generalizing %, the equivalence to high-order differential constraints, and the synthesis of steering control laws. A still-developing but fairly detailed body of knowledge is by now available, covering both global algebraic and local analytic aspects.

Reference-contexts: Thus controls defined on a fixed interval, say, [0; 1=2], provide well-defined trajectories, and by the results previously stated, smooth ones are generically nonsingular. For any one such control !, one may consider the antisymmetric extension e! of ! to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> having e!(1t) = !(t) for t 2 [0; 1). This defines a measurable control which is again nonsingular for the system, but now in addition x e! = x for each state. Thus x (e!+v) = x+ff 0 x [e!](v)+o (v).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the set of smooth controls nonsingular for is generic. This result can be found, in this form, in [22]; a weaker form in which controls are multiplied by a scalar function of x was in <ref> [3] </ref>, for general smooth, not necessarily analytic, systems with g 0 = 0, and stronger results are now available as well ([4]). <p> The problem is reduced to finding inputs universal for F e . I end with an illustration, closely connected with the results in <ref> [3] </ref>, of how this corollary can be used to numerically approach certain control problems. 4. An Application: Steering Nonholonomic Systems It is often of interest to explicitly compute motions for mechanical systems, especially those subject to constrains such as the non-slippage of rolling wheels.

Reference-contexts: such 0 , with coordinates F i (!) := hc i jcf [!]i for some vector c = (c 1 ; : : : ; c p ) of convergent generating series c, is a local analytic response. (Various more global definitions of analytic response can be given; see e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>.) From now on, I will indentify any two F 's which coincide on the intersection of their domains and Eduardo Sontag 9 "response" will thus mean a germ of local analytic response. With this convention, responses are in 1-1 correspondence with p-vectors of convergent generating series.

Reference-contexts: Many sophisticated synthesis procedures have been proposed, most based on a nontrivial analysis of the structure of L 0 , and a rich literature exists (e.g. <ref> [13] </ref> and references there.) When the structure L 0 is too complicated for a detailed analysis, a numerical technique as follows could in principle be used. For simplicity of exposition, I'll assume that X = R n is Euclidean and x f = 0.
