Abstract: The prediction of survival time or recurrence time is an important learning problem in medical domains. The Recurrence Surface Approximation (RSA) method is a natural, effective method for predicting recurrence times using censored input data. This paper introduces the Survival Curve RSA (SC-RSA), an extension to the RSA approach which produces accurate predicted rates of recurrence, while maintaining accuracy on individual predicted recurrence times. The method is applied to the problem of breast cancer recurrence using two different datasets.

Reference-contexts: Schenone et al. [21] used a self-organizing neural network to find classes of cases with similar expected recurrence times. However, they did not directly address the problem of using censored data, that is, cases which have not been followed to recurrence / death.

Reference-contexts: follow-up data are available, many of the observed recurrences take place around the time they are predicted by SC-RSA. 4.2 SEER Data We repeated the above tests on a subset of the breast cancer outcomes data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute <ref> [5] </ref>, which contains follow-up data for over 24,000 breast cancer patients. The SEER program 7 cases from the WPBC dataset with various predicted recurrence times. uses survival time as the endpoint, rather than recurrence time.

Reference-contexts: A significant body of work concerning survival analysis exists in the statistics literature; see, for instance, the summary review by Henderson <ref> [8] </ref> and references therein.

Reference-contexts: In fact, RSA predicted all of the recurrence times to be less than 20 years; in reality, the expected recurrence rate at 20 years could be expected to be around 65% to 70% <ref> [9] </ref>. This follows the bias toward early recurrences which necessarily exists in all such datasets. Not all cases can be followed to an observed recurrence; patients move, change physicians, or die of unrelated causes. Therefore, the observed recurrences are unavoidably biased toward those which occur early in the study. <p> In order to compensate for this relatively short time interval and produce more realistic recurrence characteristics, we extend the actual disease-free survival curve by assuming a 7% per year recurrence rate between ten and twenty years, based on medical literature <ref> [9] </ref>. 5 year recurrence extension. This estimate of the true recurrence rate is compared to the predicted recurrence rate of SC-RSA using three different values of the parameter : 0.0 (corresponding to the RSA plot from Figure 1), 0.1 and 0.9.

Reference-contexts: However, while RSA successfully "rank-ordered" the cases based on expected outcome, the predicted recurrence times did not closely follow the observed outcomes as a group.

Error bars representing 95% confidence intervals 2 around the Kaplan-Meier curve are shown at each 12-month interval. The RSA method tends to cluster the predicted recurrences close together, and shows an overall bias toward pessimistic (that is, early) predictions.
