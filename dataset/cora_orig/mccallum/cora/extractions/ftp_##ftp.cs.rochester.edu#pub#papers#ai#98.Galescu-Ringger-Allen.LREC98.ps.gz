Abstract: Data sparseness has been regularly indicted as the primary problem in statistical language modelling. We go one step further to consider the situation when no text data is available for the target domain. We present two techniques for building efficient language models quickly for new domains. The first technique is based on using a context-free grammar to generate a corpus of word collocations. The second is an adaptation technique based on using out-of-domain corpora to estimate target domain language models. We report results of successfully using these two techniques individually and in combination to build efficient models for a spontaneous speech recognition task in a medium-sized vocabulary domain.

After setting up the TRIPS system, we also collected a small in-domain corpus (we will call it TRIPS as well) of 2389 utterances and 12656 word tokens. From these, we used 1500 randomly selected utterances as test data.
