Title: Hybrid Anatomically Based Modeling of Animals  
Author: Philip J. Schneider Jane Wilhelms

Affiliation: University of California  
Abstract: We describe a new hybrid approach to modeling and animating animals. A predefined skin is modeled as a triangle mesh, such as may be purchased from a digital model vendor, or generated with a typical modeling program. This skin is then attached to the underlying bone, muscle, and tissue model. The rest shape of the skin is exactly as given in the surface model of the animal. Internal components bones, muscles, and general tissue are directly modeled with triangle meshes or ellipsoids. Changes in joint angle result in changes to the position of bones and generalized tissue, and in changes to the shapes of muscles. The attached skin vertices move with their underlying components, resulting in natural-looking deformations to the animal modeled. This alternative approach to modeling skin allows for greater realism or detail without requiring more accurate internals, and it allows preexisting animal models to be realistically deformed using an anatomically based method.

Reference-contexts: Our modeling approach involves the following steps: (1) obtain a surface model of the desired animal, or create one using a modeling package such as SGI Alias/Wavefront <ref> [1] </ref>, (2) triangulate the surface model, if not already triangles, (3) specify a body hierarchy and rest position that fits within the surface model, (4) design individual muscles, bones, and generalized tissues to approximately fit within the skin, and (5) attach skin vertices to the nearest underlying tissue. <p> The horse skeleton consists of 45 individual triangle-mesh bones based on a human skeleton model from Viewpoint DataLabs [8] and altered using SGI Alias/Wavefront software <ref> [1] </ref> to be more horse-like. There are 42 ellipsoidal bones for the tail, feet, ankles, lower front legs, rear legs, sacral vertebrae, skull, and jaw. The unadorned skeleton in rest state can be seen in Figure 1. <p> Acquired a polygonal model of the desired animal. These can be purchased from digital model vendors such as Viewpoint DataLabs [8] (as we did), or created using modeling software such as SGI Alias/Wavefront <ref> [1] </ref>. 2. Examined the skin, and decided on a tree structure and number of segments. We modified the monkey hierarchy used in [28], in particular removing the extraneous fingers and toes. 3. Fit the hierarchy within the skin, taking into account the location of the joints.

Reference-contexts: Background and Related Work From the early days of robotics and animation research, robots, humans, animals and other articulated bodies have been represented using a tree-structured hierarchy of rigid segments connected by flexible joints. These hierarchies are generally constructed in the shape of the underlying skeleton <ref> [2] </ref>. Beyond this, research approaches diverge greatly in how (and if) the skin and internal components are modeled and deformed.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, transformations or modifications of the implicit functions are used to model deformations of the skin.

Reference-contexts: These components do not change shape during motion, but are each attached to a particular segment in the hierarchy, and thus move relative to one another. The horse skeleton consists of 45 individual triangle-mesh bones based on a human skeleton model from Viewpoint DataLabs <ref> [8] </ref> and altered using SGI Alias/Wavefront software [1] to be more horse-like. There are 42 ellipsoidal bones for the tail, feet, ankles, lower front legs, rear legs, sacral vertebrae, skull, and jaw. The unadorned skeleton in rest state can be seen in Figure 1. <p> This process is repeated with every change in joint angle. model. The muscles are extremely simplified relative to a real horse. Notice the simplification of the musculature. 4. Skin In our system, the skin is a preexisting triangle mesh, obtained from Viewpoint DataLabs <ref> [8] </ref>, as shown in Figure 4. There are two things to note: the relative coarseness of the model there are 2,027 vertices and 4,050 polygons, and that the horse is somewhat stylized, but fairly realistic. <p> Acquired a polygonal model of the desired animal.

Reference-contexts: Recent research in human modeling and animation has turned towards anatomically based methods, using underlying tissues to generate the surface shape <ref> [21, 28, 29] </ref>. Another class of approaches has attempted to deform an a-priori-defined surface model of the being, using ad-hoc techniques to relate changes in joint angles segment positions to changes in the skin [9, 15, 17, 18]. <p> Underlying bones, muscles and generalized tissues are used to generate a skin surface, using the marching cubes algorithm. Anatomically based modeling is also described by Scheepers et al. <ref> [21] </ref>. Their emphasis is on accurate modeling of bones and muscles, but do show preliminary results of generating a skin using the same technique. <p> Given these shortcomings, and considering the tremendous increases in CPU speed and availability of memory and disk space, researchers have turned to anatomically based approaches, with some success <ref> [21, 28, 29] </ref>. Their approaches create reasonably realistic skin surfaces, which behave in a relatively predictable and realistic fashion when the joints are moved. <p> For creating a model with anatomically believable skin and skin deformations, this approach doesn't require that the bones, muscles, and other tissue be modeled with a great deal of fidelity (as, for example, Sheepers <ref> [21] </ref> would). Indeed, consider the high fidelity to natural horse motion as seen in Figure 8 in spite of the very approximate skeleton (Figure 1) on which are placed some fairly quick-and-dirty muscles and stuffing (Figure 3).

Reference-contexts: Gascuel extracted a spline surface around a skeleton [9]. Sometimes the surface is geometrically adjusted during motion to mimic deformation [12]. Turner et al. used a de-formable, elastic skin for character animation <ref> [26] </ref>. A variant of this class of methods have attempted to use a predefined skin (usually a polygon mesh or spline surface of some type), which is embedded in some space filling function whose purpose is to deform the skin surface in response to movement of the hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Relaxation operations continue iteratively until a user-defined convergence tolerance is reached, or a user-defined maximum number of iterations has occurred. The resulting smooth redistribution is important to achieve a natural appearance for fur <ref> [27] </ref> or skin with markings.

Reference-contexts: Recent research in human modeling and animation has turned towards anatomically based methods, using underlying tissues to generate the surface shape <ref> [21, 28, 29] </ref>. Another class of approaches has attempted to deform an a-priori-defined surface model of the being, using ad-hoc techniques to relate changes in joint angles segment positions to changes in the skin [9, 15, 17, 18]. <p> Once the animal model has been defined and the skin attached, animation is accomplished as described in <ref> [28, 29] </ref>. Examples from our work on anatomically based modeling can be found on our web site: www:cse:ucsc:edu=~wilhelms=fauna. 2. <p> Generally, implicit surfaces are rendered either directly [4] or by gridsampling (voxeliz-ing) the implicit function and producing a polygonal surface from those samples (e.g., marching cubes [16]). The work presented in this paper is directly related to that found in <ref> [28, 29] </ref>, which shows that an anatomically based modeling approach can achieve a good balance be 2 tween realism and the efficiency needed for interactivity. Underlying bones, muscles and generalized tissues are used to generate a skin surface, using the marching cubes algorithm. <p> The Basic Underlying Model In order to demonstrate our approach, we set out to create a model of a horse. Most of the basic model of the horse is created using the techniques described in <ref> [28, 29] </ref>; we describe it here briefly for context and completeness. The horse model has 81 segments, including all segments connected by major moving joints in a vertebrate body: skull, jaw, vertebrae, pelvis, arms, legs, wrists, ankles, fingers, and toes. <p> The novel contribution of this paper is the demonstration that the methodology for skin deformation in response to deformation of the underlying tissue, introduced and used in <ref> [28, 29] </ref>, can be applied to preexisting skin, allowing anatomically realistic deformations to be applied to standard boundaryrep digital animal models. 4.1. <p> As the solution of the equation for an ellipsoid with a given point only gives the distance from the origin, a NewtonRaphson method <ref> [28] </ref> is used, iterating until a userspecified tolerance or iteration count limit is hit; the location at termination of the iteration becomes a candidate anchor point. <p> These can be purchased from digital model vendors such as Viewpoint DataLabs [8] (as we did), or created using modeling software such as SGI Alias/Wavefront [1]. 2. Examined the skin, and decided on a tree structure and number of segments. We modified the monkey hierarchy used in <ref> [28] </ref>, in particular removing the extraneous fingers and toes. 3. Fit the hierarchy within the skin, taking into account the location of the joints. <p> Transformed the hierarchy to approximately place the nowdefined skeleton inside the skin, taking advantage of our ability to display the skin translucently. 6. Added bones, again consulting [10, 24]. Some bones were taken from the monkey model used in <ref> [28, 29] </ref>, which had been modified from polygonal bone models from Viewpoint DataLabs [8]; others were ellipsoidal bones, sized to fit the location in question. 7. Interactively added stuffing ellipsoids to the model. 8. <p> Added relatively few default muscles where it seemed muscle-defined motion was essential, and interactively shaped them to fit the skin. 9. Finetuned the dimensions of the hierarchy, bones, stuffing, and muscles to more closely fit inside the skin. 10. Attached the skin as described earlier and in <ref> [28, 29] </ref>. At this point, we had a complete horse model with pre defined skin attached, which would now transform according to changes in the underlying bones, muscles, and stuffing. <p> Given these shortcomings, and considering the tremendous increases in CPU speed and availability of memory and disk space, researchers have turned to anatomically based approaches, with some success <ref> [21, 28, 29] </ref>. Their approaches create reasonably realistic skin surfaces, which behave in a relatively predictable and realistic fashion when the joints are moved.

The horse model has 81 segments, including all segments connected by major moving joints in a vertebrate body: skull, jaw, vertebrae, pelvis, arms, legs, wrists, ankles, fingers, and toes. <p> Contracted and shortened muscles bulge, and relaxed and stretched muscles become thinner; overlying skin changes shape in response. In our modeled animal, the reverse happens muscle shape changes because of joint motion, resulting in realistic skin deformations during animation. Our muscle model is that introduced in <ref> [29] </ref>. Briefly, muscles are positioned on the bones using two origins and two insertions on parametric locations on the bones. Between these sets of origins and insertions, a default dis ponents the skeleton. cretized, deformable cylinder is generated automatically by the system. There are no explicit tendons. <p> The novel contribution of this paper is the demonstration that the methodology for skin deformation in response to deformation of the underlying tissue, introduced and used in <ref> [28, 29] </ref>, can be applied to preexisting skin, allowing anatomically realistic deformations to be applied to standard boundaryrep digital animal models. 4.1. <p> This parameterized position becomes the (candidate) virtual anchor for the skin point. In Figure 5, the lighter skin vertex lies nearest to the muscle segment between slices 4 and 5, and will be mapped to a parametric location in this region. Details of this process can be found in <ref> [29] </ref>. A skin vertex may be near several underlying components of different types. By computing, as just described, the nearest point on each underlying component, we simply choose the closest one and use that as the anchor. This expensive process is done just once, at the initial anchoring time. 4.2. <p> Transformed the hierarchy to approximately place the nowdefined skeleton inside the skin, taking advantage of our ability to display the skin translucently. 6. Added bones, again consulting [10, 24].

Their approaches create reasonably realistic skin surfaces, which behave in a relatively predictable and realistic fashion when the joints are moved. <p> As noted earlier, the polygonal skin is quite coarse, a characteristic that tends to work quite strongly against high fidelity of deformations. Consider that the monkey modeled in <ref> [29] </ref> had a generated skin with approximately 150,000 triangles, while the horse skin used in this work had 4,050 triangles. Our experience suggests that a more finely-tesselated skin would show noticably better results.
