Reference-contexts: By starting from the initial vertex (cell), the goal vertex (cell) can be found by using a standard graph search 1.2. A MOTIVATIONAL PROBLEM 3 algorithm such as breadth first, Dijkstra, or A fl . For background material on graph search algorithms, see <ref> [1] </ref>. A solution method should be complete in the following sense: if a solution exists, the algorithm will find one; otherwise, it will return failure. We will focus on a complete algorithm known as trapezoidal decomposition. This method partitions the free space into convex cells. <p> It is also straightforward to incrementally construct the connectivity graph at each event. Extra Reading: Latombe, Section 5.1, Appendix D; <ref> [1] </ref>, Section 25.3 (plane sweep principle). The trapezoidal decomposition method is also covered in Section 5.1 of [3] and Chapter 13 of [2].
