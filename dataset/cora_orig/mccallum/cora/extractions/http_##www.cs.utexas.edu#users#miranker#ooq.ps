Title: Loop Optimizations for Acyclic Object-Oriented Queries  
Author: Vasilis Samoladas Daniel P. Miranker

Abstract: Nested loop execution of object-oriented queries retains the promise of maintaining the full generality of the object paradigm, independent of the specifics of any single object model. Thus, from this starting point we have developed an object-oriented query optimizer and execution engine. The methods, developed to date for only acyclic queries, augment nested loops structures with a simple marking mechanism such that unnecessary loop iterations are not repeated. In the case of acyclic queries, the executions are asymptotically optimal. In contrast to optimal query methods based on semijoin reductions our method involves no preprocessing step and thus avoids the extra I/O associated with semijoins and prevents the formal benefits of semijoin reduction from appearing as a practical improvement. Empirical results comparing our query environment with a commercially available product demonstrate significant performance improvement.

Reference-contexts: In the light of this work, we emphasize that an analogous technique to semijoin reduction did exist in the CSP world, under the term Directed Arc Consistency. A recent development in this area has been the TreeTracker algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>, from which we have derived the results of this work. 9 Conclusions and future work We have developed and evaluated a new approach to OODB query execution, based on intelligent backtracking and a form of nested-loop optimization, which we call marking. <p> Based on our experimental data, we advocate the depth-first approach to query execution, and demonstrate it to alleviate some of the problems of performing unnesting on the data. As a formal foundation, our approach relates to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem <ref> [11, 5] </ref>. Toward this goal we have developed a nearly uniform representation of elements of the object schema and the query in the form of a query graph. This form of a query graph retains the declarative form of a query.

Reference-contexts: The database was twice the size of physical memory. The schema was constructed after the Wisconsin benchmark paradigm, with integer unique or uniformly-distributed values in the various attributes. For comparison, we used ObjectStore's internal query facility to perform similar query processing on our data. As reported in <ref> [17] </ref>, the ObjectStore query facility executes neted loops with intelligent backtracking, and optimizes access paths, using any available indexes.
