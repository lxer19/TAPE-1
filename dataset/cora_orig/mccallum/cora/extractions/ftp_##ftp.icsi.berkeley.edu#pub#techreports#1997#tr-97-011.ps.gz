Reference-contexts: Nevertheless there are only few attempts to include these aspects into AI knowledge representation systems themselves (cf. Janas, Schwind [10] or Allgayer, Reddig <ref> [1] </ref>). MESNET consequently takes this distinction into account by introducing an intensional and a preextensional layer as a representational device. We call the second layer 'preextensional' instead of 'extensional' because the extensional aspect can be modelled only by mediation of the cognitive level.

Reference-contexts: We also believe that the MESNET approach is superior to DRT [12] and GQT <ref> [2] </ref> with regard to the cognitive adequacy, the interoperativity and the homogeneity criteria specified in section 1. In this section, sorts and features will be discussed which are organized in hierarchical or polyhierarchical structures respectively.

Reference-contexts: Speaking about KRS, there is an important question which has been already discussed by Brachman <ref> [3] </ref>. It is the question about the area represented by that system. Figure 1 illustrates which parts of the world have to be dealt with in knowledge representation systems. At the bottom there is the real world comprising all existing entities (objects, facts etc.).

Reference-contexts: The logical properties of the relations are specified by means of predicate logic expressions (see section 2.3.1). In that, the approach presented here is clearly distinguished from KL-ONE-like systems, see for example <ref> [4] </ref>, where no sharp criteria are given to decide which cognitive concept has to be represented as a 'concept' or as a 'role' in the technical sense of KL-ONE.

Reference-contexts: Extensional Aspect. The distinction of intensional and extensional aspects in the semantic interpretation of natural language expressions has been widely discussed in the philosophy of language, e.g. by Carnap <ref> [5] </ref>. Nevertheless there are only few attempts to include these aspects into AI knowledge representation systems themselves (cf. Janas, Schwind [10] or Allgayer, Reddig [1]). MESNET consequently takes this distinction into account by introducing an intensional and a preextensional layer as a representational device.

Bauerle et al., editors, </editor> <title> Meaning, Use and Interpretation of Language. </title> <publisher> de Gruyter, </publisher> <address> Berlin, </address> <year> 1983. </year>
Reference-contexts: With a representation technique combining the advantages of multilayered object-oriented semantic networks with representational means corresponding to the method of Skolemization in logics MESNET achieves an expressive power which is lacking in DRT [12] or File Change Theory <ref> [6] </ref>. The encapsulation of knowledge in semantic shells is a means for delimiting immanent knowledge which defines the inherent meaning of a concept from situative knowledge corresponding to the use of the concept in the description of a certain situation.

Reference-contexts: MESNET also provides the expressional means for the word-agent-based syntactic-semantic analysis of natural language in the system LINAS 2 . 2 A Natural Language Interface to Bibliographic Database Systems - Literaturrecherche in naturlicher Sprache, for details see <ref> [7] </ref> 3 2 The Representational Means of MESNET MESNET is based on the assumption that each concept of the cognitive level (cf. figure 1) has to be modelled by an object in the sense of an object-oriented representation.

Reference-contexts: There is exactly one node lying on the borderline of the shell which represents the concept defined by this shell. This partitioning method is more general in comparison to the one proposed by <ref> [8] </ref> because it differentiates between immanent parts (connected with inheritance mechanisms for categorical as well as prototypical knowledge) and situative parts. 13 14 The encapsulation of concepts plays an important part in the inferential answer finding in a QAS.

Reference-contexts: They form a more generic conditional which is also contained in the meaning of the counterfactual sentence (lower part of figure 6). With this approach we share an opinion hold by Hermodsson <ref> [9] </ref> who states that the contrafacticity of the two partial propositions of a counterfactual is not to be considered as a presupposition but as an intrinsic part of the content of the sentence itself. 2.2.5 The Order of Preextensional Representatives Collective nouns are a well-known category in traditional linguistics.

Reference-contexts: Extensional Aspect. The distinction of intensional and extensional aspects in the semantic interpretation of natural language expressions has been widely discussed in the philosophy of language, e.g. by Carnap [5]. Nevertheless there are only few attempts to include these aspects into AI knowledge representation systems themselves (cf. Janas, Schwind <ref> [10] </ref> or Allgayer, Reddig [1]). MESNET consequently takes this distinction into account by introducing an intensional and a preextensional layer as a representational device. We call the second layer 'preextensional' instead of 'extensional' because the extensional aspect can be modelled only by mediation of the cognitive level.

Reference-contexts: We call the second layer 'preextensional' instead of 'extensional' because the extensional aspect can be modelled only by mediation of the cognitive level. Also with human beings, sets or classes of objects are represented by a small number of sample elements or by a single representative (cf. <ref> [11] </ref>). The necessity for explicitly introducing an intensional and a preextensional layer can be seen on the base of the following considerations.

Reference-contexts: Together with the corresponding set and dependency relations on the preextensional layer the deep staggered structure of the nodes justifies the term extended semantic networks which has already been used by Schubert <ref> [14] </ref> in a somewhat restricted meaning. 3 Conclusion The conception of multilayered SN and especially the distinction between intensional and preextensional layers permits a fine grained and at the same time graded semantic interpretation.
