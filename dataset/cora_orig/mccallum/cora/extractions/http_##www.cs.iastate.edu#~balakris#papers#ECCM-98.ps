Abstract: This paper describes a computational model of spatial learning and localization. The model is based on the suggestion (based on a large body of experimental data) that rodents learn metric spatial representations of their environments by associating sensory inputs with dead-reckoning based position estimates in the hippocampal place cells. Both these sources of information have some uncertainty associated with them because of errors in sensing, range estimation, and path integration. The proposed model incorporates explicit mechanisms for information fusion from uncertain sources. We demonstrate that the proposed model adequately reproduces several key results of behavioral experiments with animals.

Reference-contexts: One such localization tool is the Kalman filter (KF) (Gelb, 1974) (or some extension or generalization of it), which allows the robot to build and maintain a stochastic spatial map, propagate sensory and motion uncertainties, and localize in optimal ways <ref> (Ayache and Faugeras, 1987) </ref>. A schematic for a KF is shown in Figure 3. As can be observed from Figures 2 and 3, the computational model of hippocampal function and KF both embody the same predict-observe-match-update principle.

Reference-contexts: update the place field centers of f old to f new via the transformation: ^x i = ^x i x 8i 2 f old (1) The covariances between units in f old and f new can be updated using the following expressions (details of the derivations can be found in <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1998) </ref>): Case I: i and j were both units in f old C ij = C ij C mj C im + C f old cc Case II: i was a unit in f new and j was in f old C ij = C ic where C <p> It can be shown that this update expression minimizes the variance of the goal position estimate <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1998) </ref>. These update expressions are applied each time the animat reaches the goal. If the ani-mat has never encountered the goal before, the goal variance 2 G is set to 1. <p> We are currently exploring the possibility of such a head-direction reset mechanism being implemented by place cells in the subiculum with the correction being performed by the head-direction cells in the post-subicular region. We have also developed a method to incorporate multiple goal locations in the model <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1998) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A detailed treatment of this model can be found in <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>; here we will only present a brief summary. As the animal explores its environment the model creates new EC units that respond to landmarks located at particular positions relative to the animal. <p> Further details of the model may be found in <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>. Hippocampal Kalman Filtering In the locale system hypothesis of hippocampal spatial learning, information is integrated from two streams: the sensory inputs and the dead-reckoning system (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978). <p> It also resets its dead-reckoning estimates to zero, thereby making the point of reintroduction the origin of its new dead-reckoning frame. Now it proceeds as before, learning places and creating EC, CA3, and CA1 cells using the algorithms detailed in <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>. At each step it also checks to see if sensory inputs excite CA1 cells residing in f old . If this happens, the animat is at a place it has seen earlier in the older frame (f old ). <p> Consequently, the animat localizes to the first place that sensorily matches a place it has seen before. If multiple places in the environment produce similar sensory inputs, this procedure will lead to localization problems. Goal Representation Since the computational model of <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref> allows the animat to learn places in a metric framework, goals encountered by the animat can also be remembered in terms of their metric positions. <p> Sensory inputs obtained in this fashion were used to generate the activations of the EC layer as well as the place firings of the CA3 and CA1 layers, using the algorithms described in <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>. The animat motions were also error-prone, with motion error modeled by zero-mean Gaussians with M = 0.5. The animats possessed means for fairly accurate dead-reckoning with errors being modeled as zero-mean Gaussians with D = 0.05 units. <p> Our simulation of this experiment produced similar results as shown in Figure 6 (Right). DISCUSSION In this paper we have extended the spatial learning and localization model developed in <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref> along several significant directions. We have developed mechanisms to learn local place maps in disjoint frames, and to merge these frames to produce global place maps. <p> The hippocampal model, on the other hand, provides a place-based extension of KF and easily addresses these problems <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>. A number of robot localization approaches based on cognitive mapping theories (or multi-level space representations) have also been developed (Levitt and Lawton, 1990; Kuipers and Byun, 1991; Kortenkamp, 1993). <p> However, these models deal with topological space representations (not metric ones), and are thus at discord with the cognitive map theory of (Tolman, 1948) and the locale hypothesis of (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978). These differences are treated at length in <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>. Future Work As we mentioned earlier, our computational model assumes that the animat has an accurate head-direction estimate. This may not be the case if the animal has been disoriented. <p> neural basis of these computations in the hippocampus, including the role of CA3 recurrent collaterals in the propagation and update of estimates and covariances of the places, sharp waves in the consolidation of position and covariance estimates, and the CA1 region in the computation of matrix inversions required for KF <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>. These issues remain to be explored and explained, both through computational modeling efforts of neuro-physiological and behavioral phenomena, and through biological studies in living, behaving animals.

Reference-contexts: HIPPOCAMPAL SPATIAL LEARNING The hippocampal formation is one of the highest levels of association in the brain and receives highly processed sensory information from the major associational areas of the cerebral cortex <ref> (Churchland and Sejnowski, 1992) </ref>. It is composed of the dentate gyrus (Dg), and areas CA3 and CA1 of Ammon's horn as shown in Figure 1. <p> It receives input primarily from the entorhinal cortex (EC), which is a part of a larger convergence area called the parahippocam-pal cortical area, and outputs to the Subiculum (Sb) and back to the EC <ref> (Churchland and Sejnowski, 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Gerbils were trained to locate a sunflower seed placed in different geometric relationships to a set of visible landmarks. The floor of the arena was covered with black painted granite chips to prevent the gerbil from spotting the seed until it was very close to it <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>. In our simulations, we used a square arena of size 20fi20 units. The walls of the arena were assumed to be impenetrable and devoid of any distinguishing sensory stimuli. <p> They found that well-trained gerbils run directly to the seed when introduced into the environment. Further, in testing trials the gerbils were found to concentrate their search efforts at the expected location of the seed even though the seed was absent (Figure 1 in <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>). In our simulation of this experiment, the goal location was 4 units to the south of a single landmark, as shown by the search distribution concentrated in that region (Figure 4, Left). In these figures, filled squares represent landmarks. <p> In our simulation of this experiment, the goal location was 4 units to the south of a single landmark, as shown by the search distribution concentrated in that region (Figure 4, Left).

Right: Two landmarks experiment with one landmark removed. Two Landmark Experiments In the next set of experiments, Collett et al. trained gerbils to locate a sunflower seed placed to the south of a line connecting two identical landmarks. <p> As seen in Figure 4 (Middle), the search effort of the animats is reliably concentrated in a region rather close to the position of the goal in the training trials. This figure compares well with Figure 7b in <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>. Collett et al. also trained gerbils on the two landmark task and tested them with one landmark removed. <p> They found that the gerbils searched on both sides of the sole landmark apparently matching the landmark either to the left or the right landmark of the original configuration (Figure 7c in <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>. Our animats demonstrated a similar behavior as seen in Figure 4 (Right). distance doubled. Middle: Three landmarks experiment. Right: Three landmarks with one removed. <p> Animats trained in this environment produce search histograms concentrated reliably at the correct position of the goal, i.e., the centroid of the triangle as shown in Figure 5 (Middle). This compares favorably with Figure 6b in <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>. Collett et al. also trained the gerbils on the three landmark task and tested them in environments with one or two of the landmarks removed. <p> Similarly, when the gerbils were trained on the three landmark task but tested with one landmark distance doubled they were found to search at a goal location at the correct distance and bearing from the two unmoved landmarks (Figure 8 in <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>). Our animats display similar behaviors (Figure 6 (Middle)). <p> With these additions, an-imats can not only learn maps of environments in a piecemeal fashion but also learn and reliably navigate to goals in the environment. This allowed us to simulate the behavioral experiments of <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>. The primary goal was to test whether our computational model of hippocampal spatial learning and localization was capable of explaining their behavioral data with gerbils. <p> This is especially interesting because our animats did not remember goals in terms of independent vectors to individual landmarks, as suggested by <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>. Our results indicate that if goals are remembered in terms of metric position estimates, localization errors are enough to explain the search distributions of the gerbils observed in environments with landmark configurations changed. <p> by <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>.

To the best of our knowledge, the only computational simulation of the (Collett et al., 1986) experiments, apart from the work presented in this paper, is that of (Redish and Touretzky, 1996).

In their simulations, the animat was placed at different random positions in the arena and was given its position relative to the goal (which was assumed to coincide with the origin). <p> Once the animat had localized, it could predict the goal location which was simply the origin of the coordinate frame with respect to its current localized position.

Reference-contexts: Cells with such location-specific firing have been found in almost every major region of the hip-pocampal system, including the EC, the Dg, regions CA3 and CA1, the Sb, and the postsubiculum. In addition to place cells, head-direction cells have also been discovered in the hippocampal region <ref> (Taube et al., 1990) </ref>. These cells respond to particular orientations of the animal's head irrespective of its location in the environment and fire only when the animal faces some particular direction (over an approximately 90 degree range) in the horizontal plane.

Reference-contexts: However, animal spatial learning is still far from being completely understood or successfully imitated. Based on a large body of experimental data it has been suggested that rodents learn cognitive maps of their spatial environments <ref> (Tolman, 1948) </ref>. These cognitive maps have been postulated to contain metric information, i.e., the places in the environment are represented in a metric coordinate system, allowing the animal to take novel short-cuts and measured detours. <p> Further, any restraint on active motion ceases the cell firings. HIPPOCAMPAL COGNITIVE MAP Based on extensive experimental evidence it has been suggested that rodents learn cognitive maps of their environments <ref> (Tolman, 1948) </ref>. These cognitive maps are metric in nature, i.e., the spatial representation encodes distances and directions between the environmental cues. <p> Finally, a number of neurobiological models of robot navigation have been developed (Mataric, 1992; Bachelder and Waxman, 1994; Recce and Harris, 1996). However, these models deal with topological space representations (not metric ones), and are thus at discord with the cognitive map theory of <ref> (Tolman, 1948) </ref> and the locale hypothesis of (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978). These differences are treated at length in (Balakrishnan et al., 1997). Future Work As we mentioned earlier, our computational model assumes that the animat has an accurate head-direction estimate.

Reference-contexts: In the two decades since the locale hypothesis was first proposed, a number of computational models of hip-pocampal spatial learning have been developed <ref> (Trullier et al., 1997) </ref>. Surprisingly, only a few of the models support metric spatial representations. Furthermore, the few models that are based on the locale hypothesis make the unrealistic assumption that the two information streams, namely, sensory inputs and dead-reckoning, are largely error-free.
