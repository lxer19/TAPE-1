Abstract: We used homotopy methods to find the dc operating points of the four-transistor Chua circuit. A parser generated the modified nodal equations from the SPICE file describing the circuit. This system of nonlinear equations could then be solved using homotopy methods. The MATLAB algorithm pchomotopy calculated the solutions. This algorithm uses the predictor-corrector method to solve the differential equation which describes the homotopy path. The nine operating points calculated by MAT-LAB are consistent with the results calculated by a commonly used circuit simulator

Reference-contexts: This method of solving equations was implemented through the use of two software programs. A parser, written by Chan <ref> [1] </ref>, generates the mathematical equations from a description of the circuit in the commonly used SPICE format. These equations are then solved by a MATLAB algorithm [4], written by Hoffman [5]. We tested this method for Chua's four-transistor circuit. <p> For some circuits, these equations can be written by hand, but this 2 is not possible for more complicated circuits. A C++ program written by Chan <ref> [1] </ref> generates nodal equations or modified nodal equations for the circuit to be solved. The parser takes as its input a SPICE input file [10] which describes the elements of the circuit and how they are connected.

Reference-contexts: It then outputs the circuit equations for either nodal analysis or modified nodal analysis and their Jacobians. One problem with the Parser was that the equations were not in the correct form for the MATLAB algorithm which finds the solutions <ref> [6] </ref>. The procedure for writing the equations was changed so that all nodal equations would be written first, then modified nodal equations would be written if necessary. This avoids any gaps in the numbering of the equations.
