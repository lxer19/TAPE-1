Title: Real-Time Reliable Multicast Using Proactive Forward Error Correction

Abstract: Real-Time reliable multicast over a best-effort service network remains a challenging research problem. Most protocols for reliable multicast use repair techniques that result in significant and variable delay, which can lead to missed deadlines in real-time scenarios. In this paper we present a repair technique that combines forward error correction (FEC) with automatic repeat request (ARQ). The novel aspect of the technique is its ability to reduce delay in reliable multicast delivery by sending repairs proactively (i.e., before they are required). The technique requires minimal state at senders and receivers, and no additional active router functionality beyond what is required by the current multicast service model. Furthermore, the technique uses only end-to-end mechanisms, where all data and repairs are transmitted by the data-originating source, leaving receivers free from any burden of sending repairs. We simulate a simple round-based version of a protocol embodying this technique to show its effectiveness in preventing repair request implosion, reducing the expected time of reliable delivery of data, and keeping bandwidth usage for repairs low. We show how a protocol using the technique can be adapted to provide delivery that is reliable before a real-time deadline with probabilities extremely close to one. Finally, we develop several variations of the protocol that use the technique in various fashions for high rate data streaming applications, and present results from additional simulations that examine performance in a variety of Internet-like heterogeneous networks.

Reference-contexts: Additional functionality within routers can also improve real-time reliable multicast performance. Several mechanisms have been suggested as a means of improving reliability [16, 9, 18]. However, this is at the cost of additional router state and / or processing. Forward error correction (FEC) <ref> [3] </ref> is a technique that reduces the bandwidth overhead of repairing errors or losses in bit streams. It has been shown in [6] that a hybrid approach combining FEC with ARQ can significantly reduce bandwidth requirements of a large reliable multicast session.

This is used in <ref> [15] </ref>, with the data source periodically choosing a small set of representative receivers that have priority in sending feedback.

Reference-contexts: We also considered models where losses on links are similar to what is observed in <ref> [20] </ref> (i.e., various links in the backbone have high loss rates, links near the edges have low loss rates), and we examined the impact of bursty loss using 2-state loss models at routers. <p> The observations made from these additional experiments vary slightly from the results presented in this section. The technique was still effective when using the loss model observed by Hand-ley in <ref> [20] </ref> for two reasons. First, receivers that experienced high losses required high levels of proactivity. Second, the drop in loss at the link next to the source made using FEC more effective, even though there was an increase in loss (which also caused correlated loss at receivers) in the backbone.

The simulation was written using the TeD network simulator <ref> [22] </ref>. The group size is restricted to 500 due to the memory and time constraints imposed by the multicast group size in such a simulation. The results presented here used a randomly constructed tree topology, where the minimum, average, maximum hops to the sender were 7, 15.1, and 25 respectively.
