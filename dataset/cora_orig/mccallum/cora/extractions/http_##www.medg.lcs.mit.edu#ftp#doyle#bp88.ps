Abstract: We compare the big problems studied in artificial intelligence and related fields in order to understand some major changes|both internal and external|recently suffered by AI. The comparison finds AI with few problems to call its own, and we identify some further major changes that may occur soon. This research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DOD), ARPA Order No. 4976, Amendment 19, monitored by the Air Force Avionics Laboratory under Contract F33615-87-C-1499. The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author, and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the Government of the United States of America.
