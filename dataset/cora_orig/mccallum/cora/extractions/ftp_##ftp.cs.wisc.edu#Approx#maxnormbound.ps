Reference-contexts: It is the purpose of this talk to survey the current status of this conjecture, to correct a mistake in the verification of the case k = 3 in de Boor <ref> [1] </ref> and to verify the conjecture for k = 4. For k &gt; 4, the only results known prove boundedness of kP S k 1 under some restriction on ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ and/or m. <p> In addition, as Gussmann [9] has recently pointed out, it gives a bound independent of l for the specific breakpoint sequence ~ i = i 1 ff for [a; b] = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and for any ff 1. But, this kind of argument has as yet not yielded a bound in terms of an arbitrary local mesh ratio, let alone the conjectured mesh-independent bound. I therefore come now to the mesh-independent results for low order mentioned earlier. 3 2. <p> He had read about Ciesielski's use of splines in the discussion of bases, and wanted to extend that work. Already for this case, A fails to be diagonally dominant, so a different argument has to be used. The additional ingredient (in de Boor <ref> [1] </ref>) is the total positivity of A. This means that all minors of A are nonnegative. <p> We need to show that inf min () i y i &gt; 0; but progress has already been made since this does not require consideration of a knot sequence t t t t t of arbitrary length but only of length 8. In de Boor <ref> [1] </ref> I made a mistake in the formula for a i;i1 (and in a i;i+1 , by symmetry), as was pointed out to me a year after publication by Lois Mansfield.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, we want to bound its norm kP S k 1 := sup kP S f k 1 nkf k 1 with respect to the max-norm kf k 1 := sup jf (x)j : Conjecture (de Boor <ref> [2] </ref>): sup ~~~~~;m kP S k 1 const k (&lt; 1). This conjecture has been verified for k = 1; 2; 3. The case k = 1 is, of course, trivial and the case k = 2 was first done by Ciesielski [5].

Reference-contexts: Experience has shown that it usually pays to express a spline problem, particularly a linear one, in terms of B-splines (see, e.g., de Boor <ref> [3] </ref>). These are spline functions whose support is as small as possible. <p> In addition, these B-splines are normalized to sum to one. Hence k ff i N i;k k 1 kff ff ff ff ffk 1 : More generally, one can show (cf. de Boor <ref> [3] </ref>) that (1:1) k ff i i N i;k k p kff ff ff ff ffk p ; 1 p 1 with i := k=(t i+k t i ) and, in particular, (1:2) k i N i;k k 1 = i N i;k = 1 : Now consider P S f <p> But that is not so. For, one can show (cf. de Boor <ref> [3] </ref>) that also (1:3) D 1 X 1=p for some positive constant D k which depends only on k, and this implies that (1:4) D 2 Hence, in bounding kP S k in the uniform norm, we are bounding kA 1 k 1 whether we want to or not. 2 Now,

Reference-contexts: It is also known (de Boor <ref> [4] </ref>) that sup kP S k 1 const k but already the case m = 2 is open. B. Mitiagin announced at a meeting at Kent State University in August 1979 that, for even k, sup kP S k 1 const k ; but he gave no proof. <p> But then, since A = E 1=2 A 2 E 1=2 , we obtain kA 1 k 1 max ( i = j ) 1=2 const k and so get de Boor's <ref> [4] </ref> strengthening sup kP S k 1 const k;c of (0.1). This argument can also be used to give a bound on kP S k 1 in terms of the local mesh ratio sup jijj=1 i = j =: %, as long as % is sufficiently close to 1.
