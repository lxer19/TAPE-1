Abstract: Accurately parsing natural language sentences requires large scale and detailed lexical grammars. We will see that for the problem of parsing natural language sentences, finite-state models are not an efficient but somewhat inaccurate tool but rather one of the best formalism to represent accurately complex linguistic phenomena. Finite-state transducers should appeal to the linguist looking for precise and natural description of complex syntactic structures while the wide range of formal operations on finite-state transducers provides the designer of parsing programs with powerful tools to improve parsing efficiency. The parsing programs derived from this approach are both simple, precise linguistically and This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Finite-State methods have recently improved computational efficiency for a wide variety of natural language processing tasks; ranging from morphological analysis <ref> [15, 26, 2] </ref> to phonetic and speech processing [22, 17, 18]. However, finite-state modeling is usually thought as a necessary evil in the sense that more powerful formalisms such as context-free grammars are more accurate but of intractable size for reasonable efficiency.

Reference-contexts: More formally, each interpretation can be written as a sequence of symbols. For instance, the interpretation of left as the past tense of the verb to leave will be the sequence: (9) # v pt leave left 3 The precise description of such dictionaries is described in <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, (23) is clearly present in sentence (26). In fact, the noun phrase construction N's N to N is not general and (29) * John's turn to his friend. is clearly forbidden too. These two observations, among others (see <ref> [5] </ref>), lead to analyze sentences such as (23) with the noun (called predicative noun) as the real head and the verb, called support verb (or light verb), as support for the tense. (23) will therefore be described by the structure (30) N 0 (V sup make V sup ) (N pred <p> Some of these hypotheses are invalidated at a later stage of the analysis and the correct support verb is recovered. 12 This transformation, first described by Z.S.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the sentence is ambiguous and the correct result of a syntactic analysis should provide these two analyses. 5.3 Support Verb Construction <ref> [9] </ref> demonstrates that three categories of sentences have to be considered to build complete grammars. The first category consists of free sentences like John eats potatoes, the second one consists of sentences like John makes concessions, with complements with a smaller degree of variability. They are called support verb constructions.

Reference-contexts: One of the main drawback in using context-free grammars for modeling language is the inability or the difficulty of handling various types of deletion. Consider the sentence (1) He expected John to buy a new book. In the transformational grammar of Z. S. Harris (see <ref> [12] </ref> for instance), this sentence is analyzed as the verb expected (an operator) taking three arguments: (1) the subject he, (2) the first complement John and (3) the sentence John buys a new book; the application of the verb operator deletes the subject of the last argument to transform the sentence <p> Such a syntactic dictionary would look like the sample of Figure 1 1 . 1 This grammatical representation is motivated by the fact that grammatical representa tions, whatever the formalism they are expressed in, should be lexicalized.
