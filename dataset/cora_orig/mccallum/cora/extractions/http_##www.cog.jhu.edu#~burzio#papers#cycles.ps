Reference-contexts: Hence there seems no loss of generalization in the reinterpretation of this class of cases, tha t has many other members in English, 14 like bom (b)/ bomBard, lon (g)/ elonGate <ref> (see Borowsky, 1993) </ref> and other languages. English vowel reduction also gives rise to cases of this sort rather massively. E.g. in par []ntal, the e must be present in the active input of this item, given its absence in the base form [pr 0 nt].

Reference-contexts: Beside asserting the necessity of ou tput-to-output Correspondence in OT, this article further asserts its sufficiency in dealing with allomorphy, leading to the rejection of the traditional notion of Underlying Representation <ref> (Burzio 1994a, 1996a,b) </ref>. The article is organized as follows. In section 2 I consider the Correspondence account of cyclic effect, essentially reviewing recent literature.

Reference-contexts: As for the IO-F of (8b) it is implicitly instantiated by the assumption of PES that English stress is prevalently regular rather than lexicalized. In OT, this entails that the phonology must dominate IO-F. 1 4 (while that of verbs and of adjectives in - ic follows from MC <ref> (PES, Burzio 1994b) </ref>. Since this occurs in a minority of cases, the facts are consistent with the ranking in (8), aside for the problem, which unique/ unambiguous ranking cannot deal with, of accounting for semi-regular patterns. <p> What this suggests is that, while OO-F for outer affixes outranks OO-F fo r stems, optimization is (or can be) global <ref> (the point made in Burzio, 1994b) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For inst ance, in Italian, several formation based on - ere conjugation verbs are transparently in correspondence with both th e participle and the infinitive simultaneously, as with ascens-ore elevator based on the participl e asces-o ascended, but featuring the n of the infinitive ascendere ascend <ref> (see Burzio, 1996b) </ref>. This raises no formal problem within OT, since multiple sets of OO-F constraints, with independen t rankings, can all apply simultaneously. <p> Italian syncopated participles <ref> (Burzio, 1996b) </ref>: as. cen .dere ascend as. ce .so ascended (less marked syllable) b.

Reference-contexts: This conception, independently proposed in th e context of an an alysis of English stress in PES, turns out to be in essence the conception lon g 7 advanced by J.Bybee <ref> (see Bybee, 1988, 1995) </ref>. In turn, the latter seems implementable along OT lines under Correspondence theory. The proposed conception also has points in common with Aronoff's (1976, 1994) "word-based" morphology. The type of misapplicat ion of phonology reviewed above, then, suggests, by invoking OO-F constraints, that UR may be superfluous.

Reference-contexts: A long tradition of use <ref> (insightfully reviewed in Cole 1995) </ref> has tended to obscure the fact that it is a stipulatory provision. It does not follow from the general theory that has underlying representations and rules that the rules should apply in cyclic order.

Reference-contexts: The descriptive adequacy of (47) is therefor e 20 understood from the present point of view. A major attempt to overcome the conceptual difficulty that (47) raises for rule systems was made in terms of the Strict Cycle Condition <ref> (Mascar, 1976) </ref>, a specific restriction on the mode of application of cyclic rules that would effectively exclude them from environments which are no t derived either in the morphological or the phonological sense.
