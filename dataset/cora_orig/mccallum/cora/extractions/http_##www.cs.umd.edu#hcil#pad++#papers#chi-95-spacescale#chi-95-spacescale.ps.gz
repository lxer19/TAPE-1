Information objects and the structure embedding them can be displayed at many different magnifications, or scale. <p> Our overall conclusion is that the information metric, based on analyses of spacescale diagrams, is quite a reasonable way to determine good pan/zoom trajectories. Showing semantic zooming Another whole class of uses for spacescale diagrams is for the representation of semantic zooming <ref> [10] </ref>. In contrast to geometric zooming, where objects change only their size and not their shape when magnified, semantic zooming allows objects to change their appearance as the amount of real zooms out till both are within the window (b), then zooms in (c).
