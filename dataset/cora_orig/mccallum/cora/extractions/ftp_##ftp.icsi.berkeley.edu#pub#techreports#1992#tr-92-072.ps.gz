Abstract: Multimedia communication can be supported in an integrated-services network in the general framework of realtime communication. The Tenet Group has devised an approach that provides some initial solutions to the realtime communication problem. This paper attempts to identify the principles behind these solutions. We also describe a suite of protocols, and their implementations in several environments, that embody these principles, and work in progress that will lead towards more complete solutions. fl This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Cooperative Agreement NCR-8919038 with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Digital Equipment Corporation, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., Pacific Bell, the University of California under a MICRO grant, and the International Computer Science Institute.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the ST-II approach seems to take an indifferent position with respect to the two principles in question. The Session Reservation Protocol (SRP) is based on an approach similar to ours, though the scheme and the protocol design are quite different <ref> [AHS90] </ref>. The main divergence between the two 10 schemes lies in their client interfaces; no statistical performance bounds (which can save considerable amounts of network resources, hence appreciably enhance the network's capacity) are offered to SRP's clients.

Reference-contexts: the telephone companies in several countries: the only guarantees offered by SMDS are that, within a Local Access Transport Area (LATA), the delay for at least 95% of the 53-byte cells will not exceed 130ms for T1 service, 20ms for T3 service, and 75ms for mixed T1 and T3 service <ref> [DKK90] </ref>. The predicted service proposed in [CSZ92] (unlike the "guaranteed service" mentioned in the same paper, which is based on deterministic bounds) does not offer a priori guarantees; thus, the quality of service that a client can obtain from it is not predictable.

Reference-contexts: At the transport level we designed two protocols: the Realtime Message Transport Protocol (RMTP) [ZVF92], which is 8 intended for message-based realtime transport between endpoints, and the Continuous-Media Trans--port Protocol (CMTP) <ref> [WM91] </ref>, which offers a stream-based interface and a time-driven mechanism for applications like video and audio. The protocol that controls data transfers, primarily reacting to the detection of error conditions, is called the RealTime Control Message Protocol (RTCMP).

Reference-contexts: To avoid this unacceptable situation, the network must either control the input rates explicitly on a per-channel basis or adopt scheduling algorithms that will do this automatically in the nodes (e.g., the rate-based service disciplines discussed in <ref> [ZK91] </ref>). 4 The Tenet realtime protocol suite To be able to offer a realtime service to applications, a network must have suitable realtime features throughout its protocol hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: For obvious reasons, the first Suite 1 implementation completed was the one for the local-area testbed, and some of the initial measurements of its performance can be found in <ref> [ZF92] </ref>. 5 The next scheme and protocol suite In many important respects, Scheme 1 is still as simple-minded and primitive as Scheme 0. The basic communication abstraction is the simplex, unicast, single-path and fixed-path realtime channel.

Reference-contexts: Our belief that several types of bounds are to be guaranteed is not shared by the Flow Protocol <ref> [Zha89] </ref>, whose client-service interface allows a client to specify only an average throughput bound; the resulting delay bound can be computed, but not specified as an independent primary performance objective. The Asynchronous Time Sharing (ATS) approach is based on a fixed menu of quality-of-service classes [HL91].
