Abstract: Best-first search algorithms have been widely used to find a minimum cost path in graph search. To formulate certain problems involving temporal events, it is at times instrumental to use graphs whose edge costs are time-dependent. In such a graph, shortest paths are dependent on time at which traversal in the graph begins. Typically, structural changes in t occur at discrete points in t, where t is the shortest path with start time t. In this paper, a best-first algorithm is generalized to handle time-dependent graphs to find shortest paths together with their start time characteristics and some properties of the algorithm are investigated.

Reference-contexts: Some properties described in Section 3 need revision. For example, when TDS terminates with cy &gt; YMAX, some paths found so far to node N may not necessarily be shortest paths to N . Ishida and Korf <ref> [6] </ref> have studied a real time search algorithm under the assumption 14 that heuristic values can change over time due to a moving target point.
