Abstract: We present a method for solving the following problem: Given a set of data points scattered in three dimensions and an initial triangular mesh M 0 , produce a mesh M, of the same topological type as M 0 , that fits the data well and has a small number of vertices. Our approach is to minimize an energy function that explicitly models the competing desires of conciseness of representation and fidelity to the data. We show that mesh optimization can be effectively used in at least two applications: surface reconstruction from unorganized points, and mesh simplification (the reduction of the number of vertices in an initially dense mesh of triangles).

Reference-contexts: We see at least two applications of mesh optimization: surface reconstruction and mesh simplification. The problem of surface reconstruction from sampled data occurs in many scientific and engineering applications. In <ref> [2] </ref>, we outlined a two phase procedure for reconstructing a surface from a set of unorganized data points. The goal of phase one is to determine the topological type of the unknown surface and to obtain a crude estimate of its geometry. <p> Mallet [7] discusses interpola-tion of functions over simplicial complexes of arbitrary topological type. Our method allows fitting of a parametric surface of arbitrary topological type to a set of three-dimensional points. In <ref> [2] </ref>, we sketched an algorithm for fitting a mesh of fixed vertex connectivity to the data. The algorithm presented here is an extension of this idea in which we also allow the number of vertices and their connectivity to vary.

Reference-contexts: An important feature of the matrix A is that it contains at most 3 non-zero entries in each row, for a total of O (n + m) non-zero entries. To solve the least squares problem, we use the conjugate gradient method (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>). This is an iterative method guaranteed to find the exact solution in as many iterations as there are distinct singular values of A, i.e. in at most m iterations. Usually far fewer iterations are required to get a result with acceptable precision.

Reference-contexts: The goal of phase one is to determine the topological type of the unknown surface and to obtain a crude estimate of its geometry. An algorithm for phase one was described in <ref> [5] </ref>. The goal of phase two is to improve the fit and reduce the number of faces. Mesh optimization can be used for this purpose. <p> This same schedule was used in all the examples. 5 Results 5.1 Surface Reconstruction From the set of points shown in Figure 7b, phase one of our reconstruction algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> produces the mesh shown in Figure 7c; this mesh has the correct topological type, but it is rather dense, is far away from the data, and lacks the sharp features of the original model (Figure 7a). <p> The search space consists of all meshes homeomorphic to the starting mesh. Mesh optimization has proven effective as the second phase of our method for surface reconstruction from unorganized points, as discussed in <ref> [5] </ref>. (Phase two is responsible for improving the geometric fit and reducing the number of vertices of the mesh produced in phase one.) Our method has also performed well for mesh simplification, that is, the reduction of the number of vertices in a dense triangular mesh.

Reference-contexts: The estimated surface has several spikes in regions where there is no data. These spikes are a manifestation of the fundamental problem that a minimum of E dist + E rep may not exist. To guarantee the existence of a minimum <ref> [6] </ref>, we add the third term, the spring energy E spring . <p> The other two transformations, on the other hand, can cause a change of topological type, so tests must be performed to determine if they are legal moves. 1 In fact, we prove in <ref> [6] </ref> that edge collapse and edge split are sufficient; we include edge swap to allow the optimization procedure to tunnel through small hills in the energy function. <p> An edge collapse transformation K ) K 0 that collapses the edge fi; jg 2 K is a legal move if and only if the following conditions are satisfied (proof in <ref> [6] </ref>): * For all vertices fkg adjacent to both fig and fjg (fi; kg 2 K and fj; kg 2 K), fi; j; kg is a face of K. * If fig and fjg are both boundary vertices, fi; jg is a boundary edge. * K has more than 4 vertices

Reference-contexts: The user-specified parameter c rep provides a controllable trade-off between fidelity of geometric fit and parsimony of representation. We discovered, as others have before us <ref> [8] </ref>, that minimizing E dist + E rep does not produce the desired results. As an illustration of what can go wrong, Figure 7d shows the result of minimizing E dist alone. The estimated surface has several spikes in regions where there is no data.
