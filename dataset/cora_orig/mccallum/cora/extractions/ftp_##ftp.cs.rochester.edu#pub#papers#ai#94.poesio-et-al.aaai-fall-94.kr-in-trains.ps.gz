Title: Knowledge Representation in the TRAINS System  
Author: M. Poesio G. Ferguson P. Heeman C. H. Hwang D. R. Traum J. F. Allen N. Martin L. K. Schubert 
Note: TRAINS, deals with these issues.  
Abstract: The long term goal of the TRAINS project is to develop an intelligentplanning assistant that is conversationally proficient in natural language. The TRAINS system helps a user construct and monitor plans about a railroad freight system; their interaction takes place in natural language. The representational needs of a system like TRAINS include representing lexical meaning, dealing with the problem of ambiguity, make use of information about context, and finding a connection between the content of the current utterance and the plan being jointly developed by system and user. The goal of the paper is to describe how TRAINS-93, the latest prototype of

Reference-contexts: It is also used by the Dialogue Manager to represent conversation level information. EBTL is a typed logic based on that presented in [ Allen, 1991 ] and is implemented using the RHET knowledge representation system <ref> [ Allen and Miller, 1991 ] </ref> . Rhet includes support for type reasoning, temporal reasoning, hierarchical belief contexts, equality and inequality reasoning. EBTL adds a much needed quotation facility (as some operators need to treat propositions as terms), lambda abstraction, existential and definite quantifiers, and discourse markers.

Reference-contexts: Then there are evaluation predicates. These include absolute predicates such as Plausible or Impossible and relative predicates that allow plans to be compared, for example, according to resource usage or time constraints. Further details are available in <ref> [ Ferguson and Allen, 1994 ] </ref> . As a result of processing utterances 1.1-4.1, the plan graph corresponding to [PLAN-2545] contains two Move-Car events: one is moving a car to Corning (where there are oranges), the other is moving a car from Corning to Bath (to move the oranges).
