Abstract: Many important physical phenomena, such as temperature distribution, air flow, and acoustic waves, are described as continuous, distributed parameter fields. Analyzing and controlling these physical processes and systems are common tasks in many scientific and engineering domains. However, the challenges are multi-fold: distributed fields are conceptually harder to reason about than lumped parameter models; computational methods are prohibitively expensive for complex spatial domains; the underlying physics imposes severe constraints on observability and controllability. This paper develops an ontological abstraction and a structure-based design mechanism, in a framework collectively known as spatial aggregation (SA), for reasoning about and synthesizing distributed control schemes for physical fields. The ontological abstraction models a physical field as a hierarchy of networks of spatial objects. SA applies a small number of generic operators to a field to compute concise structural descriptions such as iso-contours, gradient trajectories, and influence graphs. The design mechanism uses these representations to find feasible control configurations. We illustrate the mechanism using a thermal control problem from industrial heat treatment and demonstrate that the active exploitation of structural knowledge in physical fields yields a significant computational advantage.

Reference-contexts: All rights reserved. we are becoming increasingly reliant on large networks of sensors, actuators, and computational elements to augment our ability to interact with and control the physical environment <ref> (Berlin 1994) </ref>. However, there is enormous challenge in controlling and optimizing physical fields using networks of sensors and controllers. The difficulties arise from three sources. First, a distributed parameter field is conceptually harder to reason about and model than a lumped parameter system such as a circuit.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, qualitative physics has focused on lumped parameter models of physical systems. For instance, the device ontology describes an electrical circuit as a network of components, while abstracting away 6 In the Matlab-based routines, essentially each source communicates with each non-boundary field node each iteration. the spatial dimension <ref> (DeKleer & Brown 1984) </ref>. However, many important physical phenomena are modeled as spatially distributed parameter systems. The SA field ontology describes such physical phenomena by encapsulating the important spatial information in the spatial objects and the neighborhood structures, permitting efficient reasoning about these phenomena.

Reference-contexts: In practice, the design is often accomplished by brute-force numerical simulations. SA offers a powerful modeling framework and an alternative mechanism for synthesizing decentralized control. The multi-resolutional SA model is particularly useful for formulating structural design problems that are not well addressed by numerical methods. Doumanidis <ref> (Doumanidis 1997) </ref> addressed the problem of control parameter optimization for distributed parameter systems. He introduced a first-order approximation to local effects of heat sources during the optimization. However, his approach ignored effects of geometries and how a field can be decomposed using the structural knowledge.

It differs from relaxation labeling in that SA builds multi-layer spatial aggregates to exploit a variety of spatial and temporal constraints.

Reference-contexts: Control Optimization Once a source placement has been designed, the actions for the sources must be optimized. While algorithms for multi-parameter optimization exist <ref> (Press et al. 1986) </ref>, they are computationally expensive for large problems and difficult to parallelize for distributed applications. The basic optimization algorithm follows the structure of many standard multi-parameter optimizers: repeatedly adjust each source's value 4 in the direction that minimizes error.

Reference-contexts: Unlike control design for lumped parameter linear systems, few analytic design techniques have been developed for distributed control of large physical fields <ref> (Sandell Jr. et al. 1978) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Second, numerical methods developed for designing and controlling physical fields require solving large systems of equations and hence are prohibitively expensive for large, irregular geometric domains and highly non-uniform phenomena. Third, physical laws constrain the ability of spatially distributed, local agents to sense and affect the environment <ref> (Seidman 1996) </ref>. Local sensors and control elements measure and interact with small neighborhoods around them. Macroscopic consequences are aggregated from local actions.

Reference-contexts: The field values are determined by a local relaxation method that iteratively updates spatial objects using the local constraints. While the finite difference and finite element methods commonly used in engineering and science for numerically approximating a field <ref> (Vichnevetsky 1981) </ref> also build and manipulate such discretizations, SA subsumes many of the same operations and provides additional mechanisms for reasoning about and exploiting important structures in the fields (e.g. the isobars and low pressure cell in Figure 2).
