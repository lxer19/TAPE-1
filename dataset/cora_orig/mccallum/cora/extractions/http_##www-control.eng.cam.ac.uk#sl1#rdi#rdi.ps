Abstract: In this paper we give a direct derivation of the solution to the continuous time finite horizon H 1 synthesis problem. An explicit separation of the time domain cost function into past and future pieces is used. Perturbations are made to these pieces which lead to Riccati differential inequalities in the form of the solution, and demonstrate the correspondence between the inequalities and the cost func tion halves.

In this paper we give an explicit game theoretic derivation of the solution to the suboptimal H 1 synthesis problem on a finite horizon, and express this solution in terms of Riccati differential inequalities.
