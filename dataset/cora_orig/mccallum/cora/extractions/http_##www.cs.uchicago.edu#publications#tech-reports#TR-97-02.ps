Abstract: We construct an oracle A such that * Relative to A we have a collapse of EXP A ZPP A P A /poly. We also create a different relativized world where there exists a set L in NP that is NP-complete under reductions that make one query to L but not under traditional many-one reductions. This contrasts with the result of Buhrman, Spaan and Torenvliet showing that these two completeness notions for NEXP coincide.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1.8 shows a relativized world where this possibility holds. Buhrman, Spaan and Torenvliet [BST93] show that every 1-tt-complete set for NEXP is also m-complete.

Reference-contexts: Buss and Hay [BH91] and Wagner [Wag90] show that languages computable with a polynomial number of nonadaptive queries to SAT are equivalent to those computable with 4 O (log n) adaptive queries to SAT. For functions the equivalence would imply we can distinguish unique solutions (see <ref> [BFT97] </ref>). Theorem 1.4 gives a relativized world where the converse fails. Corollary 3.2 There exists a relativized world where we can distinguish unique solutions but there is a function computable with a polynomial number of nonadaptive queries to SAT but not with O (log n) adaptive queries. <p> Proof: Combine Theorem 1.4 with the fact that for all relativized worlds, if all functions computable with a polynomial number of nonadaptive queries to SAT are equivalent to those computable with O (log n) adaptive queries to SAT and NP = coNP then P = NP (see <ref> [BFT97] </ref>). 2 4 The Isomorphism Conjecture Berman and Hartmanis [BH77] consider whether all NP-complete sets are isomorphic. Conjecture 4.1 (Berman-Hartmanis) Every pair of NP-complete sets are polynomial-time isomorphic. Berman and Hartmanis [BH77] give an powerful tool to show that sets are isomorphic.

Reference-contexts: Corollary 1.7 There exists an oracle A such that EXP A = ZPP A P A =poly 2 Homer, Kurtz and Royer [HKR93] show that if L is complete for EXP under 1-truth-table reductions then L is also EXP-complete under the standard many-one reducibility.

Reference-contexts: Note that detecting unique solutions is a stronger restriction than P = UP. Since the famous reduction of Cook <ref> [Coo71] </ref> preserves the number of solutions, detecting unique solutions is equivalent to solving satisfiability on formulae with at most one satisfying assignment. In this paper we also consider different reductions between sets. <p> To distinguish completeness notions we often use the term m-completeness for this Karp definition. We say A is 1-li-complete if f can always be a length increasing injection. Cook <ref> [Coo71] </ref> uses the notion of Turing-completeness where instead of a function f we have a polynomial-time Turing machine M such that x is in L if and only if M A (x) accepts. We say A is 1-tt-complete if M can make only one query to A.

Their oracle is nonconstructive and makes the polynomial-time hierarchy infinite. Theorem 1.4 is the first to fulfill the Homer and Selman approach. <p> They showed the following result.

Reference-contexts: Not just the classes but the reductions themselves must have access to the oracle. We use the generic oracle approach along the lines of Fortnow and Rogers <ref> [FR94] </ref>. We show that the theorem is true for what Fortnow and Rogers call UP " coUP-generic oracles. For the construction we assume that P = PSPACE. Since the proof below relativizes, we can remove this assumption by first relativizing to an oracle that makes P = PSPACE. <p> We can create a nondeterministic machine M B (x) that runs in linear time, queries at most jxj strings whose length is less than jxj and M B (x) accepts an NP B -complete set under unrelativized reductions. Fortnow and Rogers <ref> [FR94] </ref> show that NP B = coNP B = PSPACE B for these oracles. Thus we have a polynomial p (n)-time computable function f such that M B (x) accepts if and only if M B (f (x)) rejects. The function f does not depend on B.

Reference-contexts: Thus our paper shows that the relativized results described in this paper cannot be proven false in the unrelativized world unless one uses nonrelativizing techniques. The only reasonable use of nonrelativizing techniques so far has been in the area of interactive proof systems <ref> [LFKN92, Sha92, BFL91, ALM + 92] </ref>. Complexity theorists have yet to find other interesting applications of these techniques. At this time we know no nonrelativizing techniques to handle the questions mentioned in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Valiant and Vazirani's construction creates random subspaces of the assignments. Mulmuley, Vazirani and Vazirani [MVV87] give an alternate proof looking at maximal weighted cliques after putting random weights on the edges. Buhrman and Fortnow [BF97] show how Lemma 3.1 follows from earlier work by Sipser <ref> [Sip83] </ref> on Kolmogorov complexity. Gupta [Gup97] gives a construction for Lemma 3.1 that improves the probability to a constant if we only require f () to have an odd number of assignments. Attempts at a relativized counterexample to Hypothesis 1.2 have a long history.

Reference-contexts: Toran [Tor88] constructs the first oracle A such that NP A 6 P A which also follows from Theorem 1.4. Tarui <ref> [Tar91] </ref> gives an alternate proof of Toran's result using the high degree of the OR function over GF [2]. This property of the OR function also plays an important role in our proof.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Valiant and Vazirani <ref> [VV86] </ref> show the surprising power of solving satisfiability on formulae with at most one satisfying assignment or equivalently detecting unique solutions to NP problems. fl On sabbatical from Yale 1996-97. Address: Dept. of Computer Science, University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD 20742-3251, USA. <p> We say A is 1-tt-complete if M can make only one query to A. We say two sets A and B are isomorphic if A m-reduces to B via a polynomial-time computable function that is one-to-one, onto and polynomial-time invertible. 3 Detecting Unique Solutions Valiant and Vazirani <ref> [VV86] </ref> show how to randomly map satisfiable formula to those with unique satisfying assignments.

Reference-contexts: Buhrman and Thierauf [BT96] give a relativized world where this fails deterministically. Theorem 1.4 gives the first relativized counterexample to Hypothesis 1.2. In fact Theorem 1.4 shows a stronger result. Buss and Hay [BH91] and Wagner <ref> [Wag90] </ref> show that languages computable with a polynomial number of nonadaptive queries to SAT are equivalent to those computable with 4 O (log n) adaptive queries to SAT. For functions the equivalence would imply we can distinguish unique solutions (see [BFT97]).
