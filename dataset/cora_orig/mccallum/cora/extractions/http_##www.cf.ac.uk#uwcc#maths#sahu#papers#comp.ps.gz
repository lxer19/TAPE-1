Abstract: Multivariate survival data arise when each study subject may experience multiple events or when the study involves several members of each group. Statistical analyses of such data need to account for the intra-cluster dependence through appropriate modeling. Frailty models are the most popular for such failure time data. However, there are other approaches which model the dependence structure directly. In this article, we compare the frailty models for bivariate data with the models based on bivariate exponential and Weibull distributions. Bayesian methods provide a convenient paradigm for comparing the two sets of models we consider. Our methods are illustrated using a data set of diabetic Retinopathy patients.

Reference-contexts: However, this conclusion may well be reversed in the general multivariate setup, i.e., when the failure times are multivariate. That is, when there are adequate data points to estimate the individual level effects. This discussion is closely related to its parallel in the generalized linear mixed models <ref> (Breslow and Clayton, 1993) </ref> literature. A largely unresolved question is `is it better to model correlated data points using the repeated measures trick than to model directly using multivariate models, e.g., multivariate probit models?'. Further investigation in this area is necessary.

Reference-contexts: For identifiability purposes the linear model z T i fi does not include any intercept term. Components of fi are assigned independent normal priors with large variances.

Reference-contexts: We implement the Gibbs sampler for all five models. See the appendix for implementation notes for implementing the Gibbs sampler. Many standard convergence diagnostic measures, <ref> (see, e.g., Cowles and Carlin, 1996) </ref> have been calculated to monitor convergence and those indicated rapid convergence. Based on the diagnostics we discard first 1000 iterates in each case and use the subsequent 10,000 iterates to make inference. We do not report the diagnostics due to space limitations.

Reference-contexts: The second term is a goodness-of-fit measure denoted by G.A model with minimum D 0 is selected as the best model among all the models considered. For censored data, the criterion (11) must be modified because t i;obs is not available. The modified criterion <ref> (following Gelfand and Ghosh, 1998) </ref> is D = i=1 n X ( i v i ) ( i v i ) ; (12) where v i is obtained as follows.

Reference-contexts: These methodologies, based on predictive model selection criteria (see, e.g., Laud and Ibrahim, 1995 and Gelfand, 1996), can be used to distinguish between different sets of models with different sets of assumptions. Recent advances in Bayesian computations using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods <ref> (see, e.g., Gilks et al., 1996 for an excellent review) </ref> have enabled the computation of such model choice criteria. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the frailty models with Weibull baseline hazards functions and gamma frailties.

The distribution reduces to the 4 Freund (1961) model under 3 = 0; the MO model (4) is obtained by setting 0 j = j ; j = 1; 2: The marginal distributions are not exponentials except for the above two cases.

Reference-contexts: For example, the breakdown times of dual generators in a power plant or failure times of twin engines in a 2-engine airplane are illustrations of bivariate survival data. We consider a data set obtained from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study <ref> (Huster et al., 1989) </ref> of time to blindness in each eye of 197 patients with diabetic Retinopathy. One eye of each patient was randomly selected for treatment (the effectiveness of laser photo coagulation in delaying the onset of blindness) and the other eye was observed without treatment.

Reference-contexts: However, convenient fix-ups are necessary if the data set is not rich enough to support all five models. For example, we can set some fi to zero. This has been done for the illustrative example in Section 5. 4 Model Choice Bayes factors <ref> (see, e.g., Kass and Raftery, 1995) </ref> provide model comparison measures from a pure Bayesian view. However, they are difficult to compute in many cases and are not meaningful for posterior distributions obtained using improper priors.
