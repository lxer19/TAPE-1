Abstract: The advent of high performance computing has led to an increased role of CFD in automated optimal design, particularly in aeronautics. This paper presents a brief description of the optimization problem, strategies for its solution, algorithms for optimization, references to recent applications, impact of high performance computing and paral-lelization, and two examples of application to the design of high speed inlets.

Reference-contexts: The P2 optimization employed four variables x l , x, y and . The P8 optimizations used from three to five variables depending on the optimization function f. The Design Associate (DA) employed a gradient optimizer CFSQP <ref> [47] </ref> which minimizes an objective function subject to general smooth constraints. The package uses the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method to solve a nonlinear programming problem by solving a sequence of quadratic programming problems. <p> No grid generation was required for the NIDA simulations. The Post Processing module evaluated the objective function r p t . The Design Associate employed three different optimizers: a genetic algorithm developed by Rasheed and Gelsey [19], the gradient-based CFSQP <ref> [47] </ref> with multiple starting points, and random probes. A genetic algorithm is a heuristic optimization method which attempts to mimic the process of natural selection [18]. The method used herein begins by taking a random population of points in the design space.

In 1995 the Propulsion Design Group (Rutgers University) and United Technologies Research Center initiated a collaborative research effort to develop an automated design methodology for 2-D/axisymmetric supersonic missile inlets <ref> [48] </ref>. The inlet, shown in Fig. 9, is a mixed-compression type 17 intended for a ramjet or combined rocket/ramjet missile. <p> This optimal design was confirmed using GASP which obtained r p t = 0:375. The genetic algorithm optimizer was observed to be somewhat more efficient than CFSQP in achieving the optimal design 19 , presumably due to the discontinuous structure of the design space <ref> [48] </ref> as illustrated in the single variable trade study of Fig. 10, wherein r p t vs x d is displayed. The gaps in the curve of Fig. 10 represent values of x d for which NIDA did not return a result. Fig. 10.

The external cowl is formed by an ellipse which is considered to have low cowl wave drag [49]. Table 5. Parameters to Optimize No. <p> This observation, coupled with the increased number of design parameters compared to the P2/P8 case (8 vs. typically 4) implies a new strategy is required. The multi-level strategy consists of a simple inlet analysis code in the optimization loop (NAWC Inlet Design and Analysis Code [NIDA] <ref> [49] </ref>) and a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes code (GASP c fl with the Chien k* low Reynolds number model) outside the optimization loop.
