Reference-contexts: As before, f (x) will denote x T Ax=2. 11 Since the value of ! is not known a priori, we consider the Parametrized Motzkin-Strauss problem P (s): s.t. x T e = 1 x 0; wherein the parameter s is a real number in the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>. Observe that this is precisely the range for which P (s) is feasible. Let the optimal value of this program be denoted by v (s). The following result (Theorem 4) relates v (s) to the maximal clique size !(G). <p> The following result (Theorem 4) relates v (s) to the maximal clique size !(G). But first let us define the following set of solutions for a given subset C of V , and a real number s 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>: X (s; C) := fxjx T e = 1; x T x = 1=s; x 0; x u = 0 8 u 62 Cg: The following lemma is easy to establish. Lemma 4 The set X (s; C) is nonempty if and only if 1 s jCj. <p> Proof of 4 The feasible region of P is the union of the feasible regions of P (s) for s in the range <ref> [1; n] </ref>. This, coupled with 1 and 2 implies 4. Proof of 5 By equation (2), every x 2 X (s; C), where C is a clique of size at least s, satisfies f (x) = (1=2)(1 1=s); and hence is globally optimal.

A graph G is said to be perfect, if for every induced subgraph H of G, the clique number !(H) equals the chromatic number (H). The fascination surrounding perfect graphs stems from, among others, the following aspects relating to them: 1.

Reference-contexts: It can be derived from Theorem 5. For the necessary background on perfect graphs, the reader is referred to Chapter 9 of <ref> [8] </ref> and the edited volume [2]. A graph G is said to be perfect, if for every induced subgraph H of G, the clique number !(H) equals the chromatic number (H). The fascination surrounding perfect graphs stems from, among others, the following aspects relating to them: 1. <p> For general graphs, the problems of finding the clique number, coloring number and the like is NP-Hard. But, when a graph is perfect, these problems can be solved in polynomial time, as demonstrated in the book <ref> [8] </ref>. 2. Among the most celebrated conjectures in graph theory is the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture (SPGC). This conjecture, made by Claude Berge in 1960, states that a graph G is perfect if and only if neither G nor G (complement of G) contains an induced odd cycle. <p> This conjecuture remains unsettled. 3. Perfect graphs have many interesting geometric and combinatorial features and intriguing connections with semidefinite programming. Much of the notation employed here is taken from <ref> [8] </ref>. Briefly, ff (w; G); !(w; G) and (w; G) denote the weighted stability number, clique number and the chromatic number, respectively. For a positive vector w, w 1 denotes the vector whose ith component is 1=w i .

Reference-contexts: is a local maximum, then from the homogeneity of the objective function, and since the feasible region is conical, the global maximality follows. 2 Thus, in general, detecting local maximality is a difficult problem (that local optimality detection in quadratic programs is NP-Hard was originally established by Kabadi and Murty <ref> [10] </ref>). See [17] for related results.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 The Problem of Interest Let A be the adjacency matrix of a graph G. Consider the Motzkin-Strauss formulation (also called the Motzkin-Strauss QP) of the Maximum Clique Problem: max : x T Ax=2 x 0: The following well known result is due to Motzkin and Strauss <ref> [13] </ref>. Proposition 1 The global optimal value of P is given by f fl = 1=2 (1 1=!(G)); where !(G) is the clique number of G.

Reference-contexts: It follows that x k = x 8 k, which is a contradiction. Hence x is an isolated local maximum of P. The theorem now follows. 2 Recently, Pelillo and Jalota <ref> [18] </ref> independently proved the implication 1 , 2 by employing second order sufficiency conditions of nonlinear programming. 9 5 Recognition Complexity In this section, we will address the issue of verifying whether a given feasible solution x is a first order point, second order point, or a local maximum.
