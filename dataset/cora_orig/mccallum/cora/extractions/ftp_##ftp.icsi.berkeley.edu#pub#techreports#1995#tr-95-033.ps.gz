Abstract: The burstiness of variable bit rate traffic makes it difficult to both efficiently utilize network resources and provide end-to-end network performance guarantees to the traffic sources. Generally, smoothing or shaping traffic sources at the entrance of the network reduces their burstiness to allow higher utilization within the network. However, this buffering introduces an additional delay so that, in effect, lossless smoothing trades queueing delay inside the network for smoothing delay at the network edge. In this paper, we consider the net effect of smoothing on end-to-end performance guarantees where a no-loss, no-delay-violation deterministic guarantee is provided with the D-BIND traffic model. We analytically quantify these tradeoffs and provide a set of general rules for determining under which conditions smoothing provides a net gain. We also empirically investigate these tradeoffs using traces of MPEG compressed video.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, statistical models of the source are inherently much more difficult to enforce. 2.1 D-BIND Model As shown in [8], previous deterministic traffic models such as the (; ) model <ref> [1] </ref> and the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model cannot capture the property that sources exhibit burstiness over a wide variety of interval lengths. The Deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent (D-BIND) traffic model was introduced to address this 2 issue. <p> In [8] it was shown that the D-BIND model's ability to capture both micro- and macro-level burstiness of the video sequence, lead to considerably higher utilization than that achieved with previous models. 2.2 Connection Admission Control Deterministic admission control conditions rely on the delay analysis techniques of <ref> [1, 14] </ref> which are illustrated in Figure 3. The horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis is bits. <p> up to S frame times, ^ R j tends to reach the smoothing rate R S . case smoothing delay when smoothing over S frames (using a FIFO with rate R S ) may be calculated as the maximum horizontal time distance between the two curves b and ^ b <ref> [1] </ref>. That is, t S = max ft 2 t 1 j ^ b (t 2 ) = b (t 1 )g: (8) From the definition of smoothing, ^ R k R S , and in most cases, ^ R j=1;2;;S1 = R S . <p> this delay bound occurs at the interval length I ff (i.e., Equation (12) is maximized at j = ff), then Equation (12) can be rewritten as d = (N R ff I ff l I ff )=l (13) Since the worst case smoothing delay will also occur at this point <ref> [1] </ref>, Equation (11) becomes: t S = I ff ( R S As in the case of Figure 8, with smoothing, the worst case queueing delay is reduced and shifted from the interval I ff to I S . <p> The shaping they consider affects only the peak rate or cell spacing. For a single hop they argued that with minimal delay (less than 1 msec), significant utilization gains are possible. However, this gain is overstated since a peak-rate-allocation is assumed which was shown in <ref> [1, 14] </ref> to be an unnecessary condition for providing deterministic service. Several other works consider the case of traffic shaping in terms of statistical performance guarantees. For example, [2] considers smoothing via periodic averaging of a sources rate (PARing).

Reference-contexts: Comparatively, without smoothing, the resulting utilization is 15.6% for the same delay bound. Thus, smoothing has resulted in a 99% increase in utilization in this case. 15 6 Related Work In the recent literature, traffic shaping or smoothing has received much attention in different contexts. For example, in <ref> [4] </ref>, the authors use similar techniques to those used here to show that with smoothing at the source, end-to-end delays with rate controlled service disciplines are strictly less than with Rate Proportional Processor Sharing (RPPS).

Thus, for a smoothed source, we can bound the end-to-end delay as: ^ D = t S + i=1 H X i (19) where i is the propagation delay of the i'th hop.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, recent studies in deterministic service indicate that, in many cases, reasonable network utilizations can be achieved even while providing worst-case guarantees <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. Within this context, we analyze smoothing via a FIFO (a first-in first-out queue) so that before the packets of a VBR video source are transmitted to the network, they are sent through a FIFO that shapes the traffic. <p> For example, the maximum backlog divided by the link speed provides an upper bound on delay for a FCFS server. Delay bounds for priority service disciplines that are more suitable for providing integrated services may be expressed in a similar manner <ref> [6] </ref>. The constraint function provides the required bound on arrivals in any interval of length t, so that with the aggregate of individual source's respective b (t) constraint functions forming the upper curve of Figure 3, admission control conditions for deterministic delay and throughput bounds may be derived. <p> The local delay bounds that constitute the sum in Equation (18) may then be calculated by the admission control tests that correspond to the local service discipline (see <ref> [6] </ref> for several examples). In practice, the smoothing decision could be made if the source specifies both its original and smoothed D-BIND parameters to the network.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, recent studies in deterministic service indicate that, in many cases, reasonable network utilizations can be achieved even while providing worst-case guarantees <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. Within this context, we analyze smoothing via a FIFO (a first-in first-out queue) so that before the packets of a VBR video source are transmitted to the network, they are sent through a FIFO that shapes the traffic. <p> We use the Deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent (D-BIND) traffic model to characterize traffic using bounding rates over multiple interval lengths. This model allows for a higher network utilization by providing a more accurate traffic specification than previous models <ref> [8] </ref>. The traffic shaping implemented by the FIFO results in a traffic stream that is "less bursty" than the original traffic stream, where "less bursty" is defined in terms of the D-BIND model in a manner similar to [9]. <p> However, the smoothing FIFO at the source has increased the end-to-end delay bound by adding a smoothing delay. Thus, a bound on the smoothing delay must also be accounted for when considering the total end-to-end delay bound. With the D-BIND model and associated admission control techniques <ref> [8] </ref> used to bound queueing delay, and the techniques described in this paper to bound smoothing delay, we analyze the effect of smoothing VBR video sources on the total end-to-end delay bound considering both smoothing and queueing delays at all hops along the path. <p> For example, if a source promises that its minimum packet inter-arrival time is Xmin, this may be easily verified and enforced by the network. Alternatively, statistical models of the source are inherently much more difficult to enforce. 2.1 D-BIND Model As shown in <ref> [8] </ref>, previous deterministic traffic models such as the (; ) model [1] and the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model cannot capture the property that sources exhibit burstiness over a wide variety of interval lengths. The Deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent (D-BIND) traffic model was introduced to address this 2 issue. <p> The key components of the D-BIND model are that it is bounding, required to provide deterministic QoS guarantees, and interval-dependent, needed to capture important burstiness properties of sources which in turn allows for a higher network utilization (see <ref> [8] </ref>). Each deterministic traffic model defines a traffic constraint function b (t) which constrains or bounds the source over every interval of length t. <p> Next, a P frame is transmitted (even in the worst case) and these tend to be smaller than I frames but larger than B frames. In <ref> [8] </ref> it was shown that the D-BIND model's ability to capture both micro- and macro-level burstiness of the video sequence, lead to considerably higher utilization than that achieved with previous models. 2.2 Connection Admission Control Deterministic admission control conditions rely on the delay analysis techniques of [1, 14] which are illustrated <p> This transformation is realized with the smoothing or buffering at the traffic shaper. The mechanisms for achieving this are similar to those used for policing such as multiple leaky buckets or multiple non-concave buckets as described in <ref> [8] </ref>. The primary difference is that we are considering smoothing policies that only buffer, and do not drop, incoming packets. <p> That is, any desired piece-wise linear constraint curve ^ b (t) can be constructed with the D-BIND model. The traffic could be shaped to conform to the new ^ b (t) with the policing or traffic shaping mechanism of the D-BIND model as described in <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> Thus, in the rest of the proof, we assume that ^ b (t) and t S correspond to their upper and lower bound R S t (for 0 t I S ) and t 0 respectively. Because of subadditivity of the constraint function b (t) (see <ref> [8] </ref>), the worst case smoothing delay t S (defined in Equation (8)) occurs between t = 0 and t = I S .

Reference-contexts: The traffic shaping implemented by the FIFO results in a traffic stream that is "less bursty" than the original traffic stream, where "less bursty" is defined in terms of the D-BIND model in a manner similar to <ref> [9] </ref>. When the smoothed, less bursty traffic sources are multiplexed at queues inside the network, the resulting bound on queueing delay will be reduced. Equivalently, with less bursty traffic, more admissible connections or higher utilization is achievable inside the network for a given queueing delay bound. <p> More formally, we define smoother traffic in the following manner (similar to the definition in <ref> [9] </ref> for "burstiness curves"): Definition 1 If lim t!1 b (t)=t = lim t!1 ^ b (t)=t, then ^ A (t) can be considered smoother or less bursty than A (t) if ^ b (t) b (t) 8t.
