Abstract: In recent years, a variety of mobile computers equipped with wireless communication devices have become popular. These computers use applications and protocols, originally developed for wired desktop hosts, to communicate over wireless channels. Unlike wired networks, packets transmitted on wireless channels are often subject to burst errors which cause back to back packet losses. In this paper we study the effect of burst packet errors and error recovery mechanisms employed in wireless MAC protocols on performance of transport protocols such as TCP. Most wireless LAN link layer protocols recover from packet losses by retransmitting lost segments. When wireless channel is in burst error state, most retransmission attempts fail, thereby causing poor utilization of the wireless channel. Furthermore, in the event of multiple sessions sharing a wireless link, FIFO packet scheduling can cause the HOL blocking resulting in unfair sharing of the bandwidth. This observation leads to a new class of packet dispatching methods which explicitly take wireless channel characteristics into consideration in making packet dispatching decisions. We compare a variety of channel state dependent packet (CSDP) scheduling methods with a view towards enhancing the performance of transport layer sessions. Our results indicate that by employing a CSDP scheduler at the wireless LAN device driver level, significant improvement in channel utilization can be achieved in typical wireless LAN configurations. fl This work was supported in part by NSF grant CCR 9318933

Reference-contexts: It attempts to isolate the dynamics of TCP's congestion control from the interference of losses on the wireless channel. The solution proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> achieves the same objective with less book keeping and state maintenance at the base station. Unfortunately, these techniques do not perform well when losses on the wireless channel are bursty. In this paper we investigate the design space of link layer mechanisms for recovering from burst errors.

Reference-contexts: A method for fast recovery from losses during handoff has been proposed in [3]. It exploits TCP's fast retransmit option to reduce TCP's loss detection latency. This method, however, cannot be effectively used to recover from burst errors due to fading. In <ref> [2, 16] </ref> another scheme is proposed that splits a TCP connection into two separate connections; one between the mobile host and the base station and the other between the base station and the stationary host. <p> A layer 2 solution is attractive due to many reasons. It only requires a software modification to the device driver which makes it easier to deploy and test. It can also be used in LAN-to-wireless bridges. Solutions that rely on a transport layer agent <ref> [2, 16] </ref> or require a soft-state maintenance at the wireless access point cannot be used in wireless bridges. The level of achievable performance of the CDPS approach depends on the accuracy of the channel state predictor.

Reference-contexts: Under these conditions, the performance of transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) degrades significantly. A method for fast recovery from losses during handoff has been proposed in <ref> [3] </ref>. It exploits TCP's fast retransmit option to reduce TCP's loss detection latency. This method, however, cannot be effectively used to recover from burst errors due to fading. <p> Similarly, after the 3 rd burst error period, which occurs at t = 12:8 seconds, TCP takes 1.01 seconds to resume the slow start phase. In <ref> [3] </ref>, similar phenomenon was pointed out in the context of losses during handoff. A microscopic view of the ftp trace reveals that the time spent in the slow start phase is negligible compared to the latency of loss detection. <p> The result is that receivers which are located in fade zones claim more wireless resources in comparison to receivers located in good zones. Moreover, packets which are lost during burst periods are interpreted by end-to-end transport layers as signs of congestion <ref> [3] </ref>. Transport layer mechanisms react to these losses by throttling their transmission rates causing poor throughput. We conducted a simulation study to to perform a careful investigation of this interaction, and to develop solutions to alleviate this problem.

Reference-contexts: However, WLAN channels are more susceptible to losses because of the higher bit rates, lack of sophisticated signal processing techniques such as adaptive power control, forward error correction, and bit interleaving. Measurements of a particular WLAN system appear in <ref> [6] </ref>. Their observations show that packet-error rates critically depend on the distance between the transmitter and receiver, and surprisingly, are not monotonically increasing with this distance. <p> We use this observation to capture packet loss characteristics by a 2-state Markov model. This model conforms with the observation reported in some of the earlier empirical studies of packet loss behavior on wireless LANs <ref> [6] </ref>. At any point in time, we model the channel as being in one of the two possible states, G (good) or B (bad). We use the term, p S to denote packet loss probability in state S, where S 2 fG; Bg. <p> Recent performance studies <ref> [6] </ref> and our experience with RF wireless LANs have shown that error behavior on wireless channels is often bursty. We have also observed that using a FIFO packet dispatcher in conjunction with typical wireless link layer protocols results in poor channel utilization, unfairness, and throughput degradation.

Reference-contexts: Since the behavior of TCP sources cannot be captured by any closed form analytical expression, it is not possible to analyze this system mathematically. To perform a careful investigation of this interaction we decided to conduct some experiments on the NETSIM <ref> [7] </ref> simulator. Each simulation run involves data transfer over N simultaneous TCP sessions, each starting from a stationary host and terminating at a mobile host. During the course of data transfer, channels between the base station and mobile hosts are independently subject to burst errors.

Reference-contexts: The distinction between the wired and wireless channels arises for many reasons. As users move, the received signal strength varies significantly. In addition, there are effects due to fading, interference from other users, and shadowing from objects, all of which degrade the channel performance <ref> [8] </ref>. Frequency-hopping WLANs are further subject to a unique 3 IBM Tech. Rep. RC 20093 error phenomenon. The WLAN may hop on to a frequency channel which is particularly susceptible to interference, e.g., a subset of the mobile users may be close to some other entity transmitting at that frequency.

Reference-contexts: Exponential Retransmit Back-off: If retransmission occurs during a period when the channel is in a burst error state, the retransmit timeout value is doubled by Karn's <ref> [9] </ref> exponential retransmit back-off algorithm. For example, in Figure 2, the packet retransmitted at t = 5:8sec falls in the burst error zone. Since the ACK for this packet is not received, TCP doubles its retransmit timeout period to 3 seconds and retries only after it expires.

Reference-contexts: See the completion time of various connections in Figure 9. In summary, FIFO scheduling at the link layer yields poor end-to-end throughput. Interaction of various scheduling policies with the end-to-end flow/congestion control has earlier been analyzed in the literature <ref> [12] </ref>. However, these studies do not consider packet losses on the output link. One of the important design considerations is to ensure that all sessions receive a fair share of the wireless bandwidth. When the medium is error free, a fair MAC protocol is sufficient to ensure this property. <p> In practice, however, we have observed that the timeout period of TCP 5 is on the order of seconds, while the 4 Prior studies <ref> [12] </ref> of TCP dynamics have shown that packets from a TCP session have a tendency to arrive in groups.

Reference-contexts: If errors on the wireless channels are statistically identical and packet arrivals follow a poisson distribution then this policy will provide fairness and maximize channel utilization <ref> [14] </ref>. 6 Numerical Results Mutual interaction of TCP's flow control and the link layer dispatching mechanism in quite complex. Since the behavior of TCP sources cannot be captured by any closed form analytical expression, it is not possible to analyze this system mathematically. <p> Under a RR policy all connections finish about the same time. Results for LQF policy 16 IBM Tech. Rep. RC 20093 are rather surprising. Some connections finish very fast while other remain blocked. For Poisson sources and a random error model, LQF is known to be the best policy <ref> [14] </ref> for this system. This result, however, does not hold when input traffic and loss characteristics on output channels are correlated. As LQF attempts to serve the queue with the maximum number of packets first, the corresponding TCP source receives a bigger share of the bottleneck link.
