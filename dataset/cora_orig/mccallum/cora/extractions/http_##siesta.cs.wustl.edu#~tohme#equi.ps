Title: EQUILIBRIUM WITHOUT QUASI-CONCAVE UTILITY FUNCTIONS  
Author: Fernando Tohme Departamento de Economa 
Address: del Sur  
Affiliation: Universidad Nacional  
Abstract: The assumption of quasi-concave utility functions is crucial for the existence of a general equilibrium in a competitive economy. To drop this assumption implies to lose a main condition for the usual fixed point theorems used in the proof of existence of general equilibrium. But it will be shown that changing this assumption by another one, the weak monotonicity of the derived demand correspondences, a fixed point theorem on lattices can be applied to show the existence of equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of the approach pursued here is that it follows the rules of methodological individualism, which constitutes the epistemological base of General Equilibrium Theory (see notwithstanding the discussion in <ref> [Arrow 94] </ref>). This result is relevant for the case in which consumers preferences are partially ordered. Pelegs theorem shows that for most orderings of Euclidean spaces there exists a representation by means a continuous utility function (not necessarily quasi-concave)[Peleg 70].

Reference-contexts: It ensures the convexity of demand correspondences, which is a condition for the applicability of the usual fixed point arguments. To drop this assumption implies, therefore, to lack the help from a very useful mathematical tool <ref> [Debreu 59] </ref>. The problem that arises considering non-convex preferences can be solved by means of a corollary to Shapley-Folkmans theorem. <p> The following result can be derived (see <ref> [Debreu 59] </ref>): Theorem 1 Let (X i ; U i ; w i ) be a consumer satisfying the conditions of defi nition 1.

Reference-contexts: The problem that arises considering non-convex preferences can be solved by means of a corollary to Shapley-Folkmans theorem. The argument is that the preferences become "convexified" if the number of consumers is infinite <ref> [Starr 69] </ref>. 1 An alternative assumption can be considered, making no reference to the number of consumers in the economy, one involving a weak monotonicity of the derived demand correspondences.
