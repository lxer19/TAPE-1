Abstract: All the recursive real functions are continuous; in fact all the B-recursive real functions are continuous for any oracle B, simply because Turing Machines computing them are finite objects. But simple functions like step functions have to be in some sense be "easy" if they have recursive values and break points, although by our usual definition, they are not computable at all. So it seems unfair to label them not computable in the entire region just because of a few break points. In this paper, we investigate the properties of broader classes of almost everywhere recursive, weakly almost everywhere recursive and recursively approximable real-valued functions, which captures these "easy" step functions and many other nonrecursive functions. A recursive version of the classical Lusin's and Egoroff's theorem are proved and we also try to characterize the property of the limit of a recursive sequence of functions and show that different notion of convergence (uniform, pointwise or in measure) will result in different characterization of the limiting function.

Reference-contexts: Also, this proof is very similar to the classical proof of the Egoroff Theorem, and hence it may help to read the classical proof first (see <ref> [Ha74] </ref>, for instance). Fix an integer t, and consider the open set C t i;j for all integers i &lt; j, C t fi d fi d where m i;j = maxfm i (t + 4); m j (t + 4)g.

Reference-contexts: weakly a.e. recursive and recursively approximable functions such that its ; 0 -relativized counterpart captures precisely the pointwise limit of a recursive sequence of functions? This class of functions cannot be continuous a.e. as shown above, but they cannot be totally discontinuous which can happen for recursively approximable functions (see <ref> [HS65] </ref>, page 79). Also, a related problem is that, while we have the notions of an "effective" uniform convergence and an "effective" convergence in measure, we do not have this corresponding notion of an "effective" pointwise (or a.e. pointwise) convergence.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1.1 A real-valued function f on [a; b] is recursive if and only if there exists a recursive sequence of functions ff n g such that f n converges to f uniformly and effectively on [a; b]. In <ref> [Ho93] </ref>, where the notion of a relatively recursive real-valued function is defined, we have the following version of the above theorem: Theorem 1.2 (Uniform limit) A real-valued function f on [a; b] is ; 0 -recursive if and only if there exists a recursive sequence of functions ff n g such <p> The proof is based on the fact that we can effectively construct a recursive sequence of functions that converges to f 0 uniformly. A detail proof can be found in <ref> [Ho93] </ref>. 2 Almost Everywhere Recursive Functions All B-recursive functions are continuous. Hence simple functions like step functions are considered to be nonrecursive by this definition. <p> Note that f is in fact continuous on [0; 1]. See <ref> [Ho93] </ref> for an example of an a.e. recursive that is nonrecursive on an uncountable set with measure 0. Next we have some basic properties of an a.e. recursive function. <p> Now f ( j&gt;i=n C t i;j )g q is a decreasing sequence of recursive real numbers and hence its limit (E t n ) is a ; 0 -recursive real (see Theorem 3.1 in <ref> [Ho93] </ref>). In fact f (E t n )g n is an increasing ; 0 -recursive sequence of reals since all constructions above is ; 0 -effective in n. <p> This should be compared to the case in uniform convergence. We know that the limit an effective uniform convergence of a recursive sequence of functions is again a recursive function (Theorem 1.1). However, in <ref> [Ho93] </ref>, we show that if we do not have this effectiveness in the uniform convergence, then we can be only sure that the limiting function is ; 0 -recursive. <p> In <ref> [Ho93] </ref> we used the same method to show that the a ; 0 -recursive function is a uniform limit of a recursive sequence of functions. <p> Then in fact we can find a modulus for this convergence recursively in ; 0 , and with this we can show that f is ; 0 -recursively approximable. The proof of the following lemma is very similar to the proof of Lemma 4.1 in <ref> [Ho93] </ref>. Lemma 4.6 Suppose ff n g is a recursive sequence of functions converging to a function f in measure on [0; 1], then there exists a modulus function for this convergence which is recursive in ; 0 . Proof. <p> This is not the best possible characterization we can have because in general convergence in measure does not implies convergence pointwise. In fact, we list finding a precise characterization of the pointwise convergence as an open problem. 5 Open Problems In <ref> [Ho93] </ref> and this paper, we have completely characterized the effect of taking the uniform limit or limit in measure of a recursive sequence of functions (and its relativized counterpart). However, we have not been able to give a precise characterization for the pointwise convergence.

Reference-contexts: If we have the additional property that the Lebesgue measure (S) = b a then f is said to be almost everywhere recursive (abbreviated a.e. recursive) on [a; b]. Ko in <ref> [Ko91] </ref> has shown that the domain of a partial recursive function is recursively open. In fact, a set is recursively open if and only if it is the domain of some partial recursive function. A consequence of this observation is that a partial recursive function is continuous on its domain. <p> We will prove a more general version in Theorem 4.4. On the other hand, the class of a.e. recursive functions are not closed under differentiation. This can be seen via a corollary to a theorem first proved by Myhill [My71] and generalized by Ko <ref> [Ko91] </ref>. Theorem 2.5 (Myhill-Ko) There exists a continuously differentiable recursive function f on [0; 1] such that f 0 (d) is not a recursive real number for all dyadic rational d 2 [0; 1]. 2 Proof. The proof can be found in [Ko91] page 193 to 196. <p> proved by Myhill [My71] and generalized by Ko <ref> [Ko91] </ref>. Theorem 2.5 (Myhill-Ko) There exists a continuously differentiable recursive function f on [0; 1] such that f 0 (d) is not a recursive real number for all dyadic rational d 2 [0; 1]. 2 Proof. The proof can be found in [Ko91] page 193 to 196. Corollary 2.6 There exists a recursive function f such that f is continuously differentiable on [0; 1] but f 0 is not a.e. recursive. Proof. Take f to be the one in the above theorem. <p> In the next section, we will look into a weaker kind of convergence, the convergence in measure, which is in some sense more "uniform". 4 Recursive Approximability In this section, the class of recursively approximable functions and its relativized version will be defined. The definition is due to Ko <ref> [Ko91] </ref>. This class of functions is closely related to another type of convergence, the convergence in measure. Definition. <p> automatically assume this whenever we have effective convergence in measure. 9 Note that, by definition, we have fl (A n ) &gt; 1 2 n . 17 The following characterization of a recursively approximable function as the limit in measure of a recursive sequence of functions is due to Ko <ref> [Ko91] </ref>. Theorem 4.3 (Ko) A real-valued function f on [0; 1] is recursively approximable if and only if there exists a recursive sequence of functions ff n g on [0; 1] such that f n converges to f in measure effectively. Proof. ((=).

Reference-contexts: A recursive sequence of B-recursive functions is defined similarly. Many basic properties of a recursive function can be found in <ref> [PR88] </ref>. An important result is that recursive functions are closed under effective and uniform convergence. <p> We make use of a theorem by Pour-El and Richards that if a recursive function f on [0; 1] is differentiable and such that f 0 is effectively uniformly continuous, then f 0 is also recursive. See <ref> [PR88] </ref> page 53 for detail. Theorem 2.7 Suppose f is a.e. recursive on [0; 1], then (1) if f is continuous, then it is ; 0 -recursive, and (2) if f is effectively uniformly continuous, then it is recursive. Proof.
