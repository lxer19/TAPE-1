Abstract: Human performance in a head-mounted display depends largely on the display's field of view (FOV). Light enters our eyes through an angular visual field that spans approximately 200 degrees horizontally and 150 degrees vertically, but this is not matched by typical head-mounted displays (HMD's), nor do we really know whether it needs to be for all tasks. Many commercially available HMD's have relatively narrow fields of view, ranging from roughly 30 to 70 degrees diagonally. Narrow FOV has been shown to degrade human performance on navigation, spatial awareness, manipulation, and target-tracking tasks, and to disrupt our eye- and head-movement coordination and our perception of size, space, and ego-center. Wide FOV displays are not yet generally available, and even when the engineering difficulties of realizing them are overcome, choosing the widest FOV possible may not be optimal for many applications. A wide FOV will aggravate simulator sickness effects, and in particular those due to vection and visual-vestibular mismatch, and may just not be necessary for a task that is localized in a small region of space. Three experiments were conducted under different field-of-view conditions, and goggles with circular apertures were worn by the subjects. In the first experiment, subjects looked around a room and were asked afterwards to recreate a model of the room with the objects in it. Subjects were less accurate under the restricted conditions (9, 14, 60 degrees). The second experiment required the subjects to walk a winding path and stay within two marked lines. Restricted field of view resulted in slower times and more errors. The third task, which required eye-hand
