Reference-contexts: The purpose of this chapter is to provide an understanding of the various alternatives in providing continuous connectivity to the mobile host and identify the weaknesses of these alternatives. 2.1 Introduction There have been many past efforts to support wireless mobile data communication, including ALOHA <ref> [Abra70] </ref>, DARPA Packet Radio [Lein87, Jubi87], commercial paging systems, Mobile-IP and cellular telephony. In this section, we only examine previous work that has concentrated on supporting host mobility in cellular style systems. This previous work falls into the following three categories: 1.

Reference-contexts: In fact, given the cell reuse patterns used by most AMPS systems 416 channels are never available in a single cell. A centralized control system can easily handle the routing load imposed by this number of channels. 2.2.2 VC Trees <ref> [Acam94] </ref> The VC Tree solution aims to support a PCS environment in which the wired and wireless network use Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology. The objective of the VC Tree approach is to reduce the number of router updates caused by handoffs.

Reference-contexts: This lifetime is at most the round trip time between the mobile and corresponding host. Therefore, the state for a connection at the base station can be recreated in a single round trip time. A preliminary design of a protocol based on these ideas appeared in <ref> [Amir95] </ref>. Simulations of the protocol indicated that it was capable achieving the same throughput as unmodified TCP at 10 times higher bit-error rates. These promising results were verified by an implementation described in [Bala95a]. This implementation was built on the same infrastructure as described in Chapter 4.

Reference-contexts: The AMPS system must support a single connection to a relatively simple mobile host. We also examine the VC Tree and Groups systems that provide support for more sophisticated mobile hosts in ATM environments. 2.2.1 Advanced Mobile Phone System <ref> [Anon93, Bals93, Ioan93a] </ref> The North American cellular telephone system, Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), is the largest mobile communication systems currently in operation. The AMPS system uses centralized control to provide connection-oriented network service to mobile users. The system consists of the following three types of devices: 1.

Reference-contexts: These measures result in an unnecessary reduction in the links bandwidth utilization, thereby causing a significant degradation in performance in the form of poor throughput and very high interactive delays [Cace94]. Recently, several reliable transport-layer protocols for networks with wireless links have been proposed <ref> [Bakr94, Bakr95, Cace94, Yava94] </ref> to alleviate the poor end-to-end performance of unmodified TCP in the wireless medium. <p> These proposals fall into two classes of approaches: the split-connection approaches and the link-layer reliability approaches. 2.4.1 The Split Connection Approaches [Badrinat93, Bakre95] The Indirect-TCP (I-TCP) protocol <ref> [Bakr94, Bakr95] </ref> was one of the first protocols to use this method. <p> However, this tuning results in poor performance over wireless links with high bit-error rates. We have developed a protocol, the snoop protocol, that alleviates the problems caused by high bit-error rate while supporting low-latency handoffs. Recently, several reliable transport-layer protocols for networks with wireless links have been proposed <ref> [Bakr94, Bakr95, Yava94, Paul95] </ref> to alleviate the poor end-to-end performance of unmodified TCP in the wireless medium. These proposals are summarized in Section 2.4. In summary, the existing approaches to combat high-bit error rates maintain a large amount of hard state at the base station.

The I-TCP handoffs range from 265 ms for empty socket buffers to 1430 ms for 32KByte socket buffers <ref> [Bakr95] </ref>. Clearly, this is an unsatisfactory solution. We must explore alternative mechanisms to perform this state transfer more quickly. 2.5 Summary of Related Work Unfortunately, prior work in this area has not provided a scalable solution that addresses the issue of providing consistent end-to-end performance. <p> The duration of this transfer is directly related to the amount of state present in a base station and inversely related to the wired network bandwidth available between nearby base stations. The I-TCP system uses this form of state transfer in their handoff <ref> [Bakr95] </ref>. In their system, the presence of a significant amount of state at the base station lengthens the handoff duration from 245 msecs to approximate 1435 msecs. <p> However, this tuning results in poor performance over wireless links with high bit-error rates. We have developed a protocol, the snoop protocol, that alleviates the problems caused by high bit-error rate while supporting low-latency handoffs.

Reference-contexts: In general, the errors and missing data (holes) in the state result in degraded performance in protocols using soft state. Therefore, our handoff protocol must attempt replicate 127 state as closely possible to provide the best possible performance.

This environment violates many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded end-to-end performance. Several proposals <ref> [Bala95b] </ref> for improving end-to-end TCP performance have appeared in recent publications. There remains work to be done in modifying existing protocols for operation in the ubiquitous information access environment. In addition, systems such as satellite communications, which provide highly asymmetric bandwidth and long round-trip times, will need entirely new protocols.

Reference-contexts: This results in a loss in efficiency for data communications, due to the lack of statistical multiplexing. However, the smaller channels make the individual transmitters and receivers simpler and cheaper. Some FDMA systems, such as the GSM-based <ref> [Bals93] </ref> digital cellular systems, combine FDMA with TDMA to provide multiple access to a single frequency channel. <p> The AMPS system must support a single connection to a relatively simple mobile host.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1.5 shows the effects of this procedure. The (inter)network layer of standard protocol stacks performs this routing. To understand the implications of adding these routing updates, we examine routing in different types of network layers today. Datagram routing protocols such as the Internet Protocol <ref> [Post81a, Brad89] </ref> (IP) are the basis of todays most popular internetwork systems. However, there are also a large number of connection-oriented systems including the telephone system and various Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. <p> When the mobile host is not at its home network, the MR responsible for the MH intercepts the packet. The MR uses its location information and the IP loose source routing (LSR) option to route the packet to the MH through the BAS serving it. In addition, RFC1122 <ref> [Brad89] </ref> specifies that if a host receives a packet with the LSR option it must use the reverse route for any replies. Therefore, the protocol requires the MHs to attach the LSR option to all packets transmitted. <p> The system must transfer this state quickly and efficiently to avoid adding significant delay to the handoff process. One system that performs this state transfer is I-TCP. Reliable transport protocols such as TCP <ref> [Post81b, Stev94, Brad89] </ref> have been tuned for traditional networks made up of wired links and stationary hosts. TCP performs very well 44 on such networks by adapting to end-to-end delays and packet losses caused by congestion. <p> This protocol is described in detail in the next section. 5.3 Case Study Snoop Protocol Handoff In Section , we described some of the problems TCP has in wireless networks. Reliable transport protocols such as TCP <ref> [Post81b, Stev94, Brad89] </ref> have been tuned for traditional networks made up of wired links and stationary hosts.

Although the portable terminal, called the pad, contains no general purpose computational resources, it does contain a sophisticated low power chipset that displays text and graphics, plays audio and compressed video, records audio, and captures pen input. <p> The hardware in the pad supports the operation of the wireless link, and the acquisition and display of multimedia data. A set of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed specifically for low power dissipation <ref> [Chan94] </ref> perform much of the processing in the terminal.

Reference-contexts: State replication, enabled by the multicast, to avoid explicit state transfers during the handoff processing. The advantages of each of these techniques have been successfully demonstrated in the mobility support implemented for the Daedalus <ref> [Dae95] </ref> and InfoPad [Shen92, Sesh94] testbeds. The Daedalus testbed uses off-the-shelf portable computer and wireless networking hardware to create the desired ubiquitous information access system. The InfoPad system presents a much different environment by using a custom portable terminal with limited computation capabilities. <p> We choose to implement the concepts in a IP network since IP is the most common routing protocol and is the basis of the rapidly growing Internet. This implementation operates on the Daedalus testbed <ref> [Dae95] </ref>, which uses off-the-shelf portable computers and wireless network hardware to create an IP-based mobile environment. This chapter presents the details and performance of this implementation. 4.1 Introduction As mentioned in Section 2.3, the introduction of mobile hosts in the IP based Internet introduces many new problems.

To provide mobile users access to such services we must understand the requirements of connecting to the networks available today and in the future. <p> To improve the efficiency of this delivery, many networks now perform the necessary maintenance of destination membership and duplication of packets.

The popularity of MBone applications indicates that future networks will support this multicast. <p> We chose to use IP Multicast to deliver packets to multiple base stations. However, many other mechanisms can be used to perform the necessary delivery of packets. The drawbacks of the IP Multicast currently used, DVMRP <ref> [Deer89] </ref>, include inefficient support for wide area, sparse membership groups and high overhead of maintaining multicast routing tables. The delivery of packets from the home agent to a few, possibly far away base stations is not well suited to DVMRP based IP Multicast. <p> The drawbacks of the DVMRP <ref> [Deer89] </ref> include inefficient support for wide-area, sparse membership groups and high overhead of maintaining multicast routing tables.

In order to provide these performance guarantees to individual conversations, approaches such as the Tenet Real-Time Protocol Suite <ref> [Ferr92] </ref> rely on connection-oriented networks and resource reservation. In this chapter, we examine and analyze various methods of supporting handoff in protocols such as Tenet. 49 These protocols use per-connection resource allocation in a connection-oriented network to ensure that guarantees will not be violated under conditions of heavy network congestion. <p> Many multimedia services, such as audio-video conferencing or video playback, have associated with them performance requirements that must be met to guarantee acceptable service to the users.

This approach relies on resource reservation in a connection-oriented network environment. The Tenet suite is used as the basis of the wired network for our analysis. <p> In the case where a network offers deterministic delay bounds <ref> [Ferr92] </ref>, it would be possible to use those values in this derivation.

Reference-contexts: The objective of aggregating the nodes together is to minimize the total weight of edges between the sets. This minimizes the amount of handoff traffic between networks. This step is known as the Graph Partitioning problem and is NP-Complete <ref> [Gare79] </ref>. The next step of the algorithm is to map the graph back to an actual network topology while taking the restrictions placed by router fan-out into account. This can be done using a greedy algorithm.

Reference-contexts: There is a single root node per region. However to reduce inter-region handoffs, regions must be made as large as possible.

The approach divides the wireless network into regions controlled by a supervisor host. In addition, the design puts the cells within a region into different groupings of likely handoff targets.

Reference-contexts: In the presence of the high bit-error rates, intermittent connectivity and handoffs characteristic of wireless environments, TCP reacts to packet losses as it would in the wired environment: it drops its transmission window size before retransmitting packets, initiates congestion control or avoidance mechanisms (e.g., slow start <ref> [Jaco88] </ref>) and resets its retransmission timer (Karns Algorithm [Karn87]). These measures result in an unnecessary reduction in the links bandwidth utilization, thereby causing a significant degradation in performance in the form of poor throughput and very high interactive delays [Cace94].

Reference-contexts: These characteristics include causes for data loss and variations in end-to-end delays. For example, the TCP <ref> [Post81b, Jaco92] </ref> transport protocol assumes that all losses in networks are a result of congestion and that any end-to-end delay greater than the average delay plus twice the variance is an indication of loss. When such delays or losses occur, TCP invokes the appropriate mechanism to avoid future problems.

Reference-contexts: This prevents the development of a simple mechanism to optimize routes from unmodified Internet hosts. A separate IETF draft presents mechanisms to add forwarding from previous foreign agents and route optimization from modified Internet hosts <ref> [John95] </ref>. To add this support, foreign agents and corresponding hosts must maintain a binding cache containing the home and care-of address for mobile hosts. In addition, these hosts must encapsulate and transmit packets directly to the MHs care-of address. <p> The Mobile IP protocol supports optimal routing between the computer servers and the mobile host through the use of the protocols route optimization option <ref> [John95] </ref>. This optimal routing allows corresponding host to transmit packets directly to a mobile host without the use of a home agent. However, the Mobile IP standard does not adequately support the real-time nature of data streams to the pad since packets during a handoff are unacceptably delayed or lost.

Reference-contexts: In this stage, our system uses multicast [Deer91], hints and intelligent buffering in nearby base stations to eliminate data loss and provide the consistent performance that applications and protocols require <ref> [Keet93] </ref>. We chose to use this form of second-stage routing based on our analysis of connection-oriented routing. The analysis indicated that multicast effectively reduces routing update time by localizing the changes and that, with the availability of hints, buffering eliminated the possible packet loss without the need for forwarding.

Reference-contexts: In the following subsections we describe the characteristics of some of the more popular transmission technologies. 1.1.1 Radio The characteristics of radio (&lt; 2.5 GHz carrier frequency) propagation and reception define the many of the capabilities and characteristics of cellular radio networks <ref> [Linn95, Schi91] </ref>. Most building structures do not interfere with these frequencies of radio waves. However, most radio networks have null regions, areas in which an MH loses wireless contact with its BS, possibly due to other forms of interference with radio propagation. <p> The same operation was done for packets 132 (acknowledgments) from the mobile host. We also experimented with using a two-state Markov error generator that more accurately modeled the wireless channel <ref> [Linn95] </ref>. The two states corresponded to periods of good connectivity and periods of poor connectivity. Poisson-distributed errors were generated at different rates in each state. We varied the transition probability from the good to the poor connectivity state from 1% to 0.1%.

Reference-contexts: These control messages install state for the connection in each router along this path. Each router maintains a table containing the next network hop and possibly some other state (for QOS or other purposes) for each of the connections that passes through it <ref> [Mah93] </ref>. Routers forward each packet based on the connection ID in the packet header and contents of the connection routing table. Although the system may take a long time to establish a connection, it can perform the routing of data for a connection very quickly and efficiently. <p> Assuming the tests succeed, the nodes tentatively allocate resources (such as bandwidth), pending the acceptance of this channel at all other participating nodes. On the return pass of a successful establishment, the nodes commit the resources to the channel. <ref> [Mah93] </ref> describes in detail a mechanism and protocol by which real-time channels can be established and managed. We also assume that all connections have at most one MH as an endpoint, i.e., at least one endpoint is a fixed host on the wired network.

To provide mobile users access to such services we must understand the requirements of connecting to the networks available today and in the future. <p> In the past, the source of the packet must perform the replication and transmission necessary to deliver the packets to multiple destinations. To improve the efficiency of this delivery, many networks now perform the necessary maintenance of destination membership and duplication of packets. The MBone <ref> [MBo95, Erik94] </ref>, a virtual network inside the Internet that uses IP Multicast [Deer89, Deer91], implements this efficient form of delivery. The popularity of MBone applications indicates that future networks will support this multicast.

Reference-contexts: The state maintained at a base station in I-TCP consists mainly of a set of socket buffers. Since this state must be moved to another base station during handoff, the latency of handoff is proportional to the size of these socket buffers. 2.4.2 Link-level Retransmissions <ref> [Paul95] </ref>: In this approach, the wireless link implements a retransmission protocol coupled with forward error correction at the data-link level. This approach improves the reliability of communication independent of the higher-level protocol. <p> However, this tuning results in poor performance over wireless links with high bit-error rates. We have developed a protocol, the snoop protocol, that alleviates the problems caused by high bit-error rate while supporting low-latency handoffs. Recently, several reliable transport-layer protocols for networks with wireless links have been proposed <ref> [Bakr94, Bakr95, Yava94, Paul95] </ref> to alleviate the poor end-to-end performance of unmodified TCP in the wireless medium. These proposals are summarized in Section 2.4. In summary, the existing approaches to combat high-bit error rates maintain a large amount of hard state at the base station.

Reference-contexts: The home agent uses IP-in-IP encapsulation <ref> [Perk95a] </ref> to forward the packet to the current care-of address for the MH. If the care-of address corresponds to a foreign agent (FA), it must decapsulate the packet and deliver it to the MH.

Any loss of a handoff control message can result in long periods during which inefficient or incorrect routing results. These problems prevent this approach from being a viable alternative. 2.3.6 IETF Mobile IP Draft 12 <ref> [Perk95b] </ref> The IETF Mobile IP protocol combines many of the concepts that were put forth in the IBM, CMU and IPTP proposals. Like these previous proposals, the IETF protocol uses the concept of a home agent (HA) that resides on the home network of the MH. <p> Among routing protocols, much has been accomplished in the context of providing support for the Internet protocol suite in a wireless environment <ref> [Perk95b] </ref>. However, these systems tend to have significantly degraded performance during handoffs. Conversely, the cellular telephone network uses circuit switching to provide connection-oriented services. It maintains these connections during handoffs through highly centralized knowledge and control by the mobile telephone switching offices. <p> A number of solutions to this problem have been proposed and are described in that section. In most proposed solutions, including IETF Mobile IP <ref> [Perk95b] </ref>, packets traversing the network during a handoff are lost or experi 87 ence unusually long delays. The IETF Mobile IP system assigns a home network to each mobile host.
