Reference-contexts: The analysis presented here is loosely inspired by work in two rather disparate areas of current research: Anderson's (Anderson, 1990; Anderson and Schooler, 1991) theory of the adaptive nature of human cognition, and work coming under the rubric of statistical natural language processing (See Charniak <ref> (Charniak, 1993) </ref> for a review of work in this area.) The common thread underlying both of these approaches is the notion that an efficient language processor can be seen as having molded itself to the regularities in its environment.

Reference-contexts: These results has been primarily used to argue against the stage model (Searle, 1979) of metaphor processing where the literal meaning of an utterance is first computed, found to be lacking, and then reanalyzed as a metaphor. There is, of course, still considerable debate over this issue <ref> (Dascal, 1989) </ref>. Somewhat lost in this debate is the fact that a considerable amount of information has been amassed showing how specific kinds of context facilitate or fail to facilitate metaphor comprehension. These results provide constraints on computational models of metaphor above and beyond basic timing constraints (Gerrig, 1989).

Reference-contexts: based on three interrelated research efforts: the notion of conventional conceptual metaphors as articulated in (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Lakoff, 1987; Johnson, 1987; Lakoff and Turner, 1988), direct computational implementations of this notion as in (Martin, 1990) and finally a fine-grained, on-line, computational implementation (Jurafsky, 1992) of a Construction Grammar <ref> (Fillmore et al., 1988) </ref> inspired conceptual analyzer. This implementation is based on a broadened notion of a construction that accounts for frequency based evidential access in a manner that is consistent with the data presented in this article.

Reference-contexts: In a separate experiment, they also showed that target contexts facilitate subsequent metaphor comprehension as compared to unrelated contexts. Kemper (Kemper, 1989) produced similar results for both the literal source and target conditions. The work reported in <ref> (Gerrig and Healy, 1983) </ref> is somewhat different from these other context studies. Rather than manipulate prior sentential context, in this work the presentation of material within metaphorical sentences was manipulated. Consider the following example. The train followed the parallel ribbons. The parallel ribbons were followed by the train. <p> These results parallel those in lexical access that show initial activation of all of a words senses followed by a rapid pruning based on local and global context. The On-Line Constraint <ref> (Gerrig and Healy, 1983) </ref> states that metaphorical interpretations, like other interpretations, are constructed in an on-line incremental fashion. Gerrig and Healy's research shows that the order of presentation of material providing evidence for or against a metaphorical reading has strong effects on on-line processing.

Reference-contexts: The principal areas of debate concern the conceptual nature and roles of these source and target concepts and the means by which the set of associations are arrived at. For an extensive discussion of these issues from a psycholinguistic perspective see <ref> (Gibbs, 1992) </ref>. Fortunately, for the purposes of this analysis, these issues do not need to be fully resolved.

Reference-contexts: To make these notions concrete consider the following example extracted from the Wall 4 Street Journal. 1 Spain Fund tumbled 23% in turbulent trading, dragging down the shares of other so-called country funds. This example has three instantiations of the numerical-value-as-location metaphor <ref> (Hobbs, 1979) </ref>. In this metaphor, the source concept is the notion of a location in physical space, often an altitude. The target domain is the notion of some abstract state that has an associated numerical value.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, there are results that can with some massaging be readily interpreted as relevant to our measures. 4.1 Literal Source Contexts The primary result for the case of literal source contexts comes from a series of studies reported by Inhoff <ref> (Inhoff et al., 1984) </ref>. In these experiments, subjects were first presented with a single context sentence followed by a metaphor test sentence. The three types of context that were investigated correspond nicely to our contexts: a literal source context, a literal target context, and a closely related metaphor context. <p> Contexts containing expressions of target concepts of subsequent metaphors facilitate comprehension of those metaphors. 4.3 Metaphorical Contexts Results concerning our final context type, metaphorical contexts, come from both the <ref> (Inhoff et al., 1984) </ref> and (Kemper, 1989) studies. In both cases, contexts were created containing instances of metaphors generated from constructs that correspond to the notion of conventional conceptual metaphors.

Reference-contexts: The account presented here is based on three interrelated research efforts: the notion of conventional conceptual metaphors as articulated in (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Lakoff, 1987; Johnson, 1987; Lakoff and Turner, 1988), direct computational implementations of this notion as in (Martin, 1990) and finally a fine-grained, on-line, computational implementation <ref> (Jurafsky, 1992) </ref> of a Construction Grammar (Fillmore et al., 1988) inspired conceptual analyzer. This implementation is based on a broadened notion of a construction that accounts for frequency based evidential access in a manner that is consistent with the data presented in this article. <p> At the core of this approach is the idea that individual constructions consist of a structural alignment of specific grammatical, semantic and pragmatic facts about the language. Grammatical constructs are, therefore, coupled directly with their specific semantic and pragmatic content. Under the account given in <ref> (Jurafsky, 1992) </ref>, interpretation is seen as a process of accumulating evidence in an incremental on-line fashion for the instantiation of a construction.
