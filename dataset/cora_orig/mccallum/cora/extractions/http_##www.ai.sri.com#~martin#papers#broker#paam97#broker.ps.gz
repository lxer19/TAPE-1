Abstract: To date, document identification based on keyword matching strategies has been the basis of most efforts to provide assistance in accessing information resources on the Internet. However, in view of the limitations on human browsing time and the evolution of more capable software agents, we can expect rapid expansion in the use of fully queryable information sources (such as databases and knowledge bases) and semiqueryable sources (such as form-based query pages on the World Wide Web, and collections of Web pages that are structured by textual markups). This paper describes a working prototype Information Broker system, developed within the Open Agent Architecture framework, that provides transparent access to a variety of information sources, each encapsulated as an independent agent. In this system, a broker meta-agent provides flexible mediation services, accepting queries expressed in broker or source schemas, gathering and integrating all available responses from the relevant sources, and allowing for the addition or deletion, at runtime, of participating information sources. Other broker features support the use of conversions, normalizations, and other basic domain knowledge in queries, and persistent queries (for which the Broker notifies requestors of changes in information sources that could affect their results). Source agents implement caching and retrieval strategies that alleviate problems related to the long access times and unreliability of Internet sources.

Reference-contexts: In the database community, several systems are being built around the notion of a mediator, including CARNOT [4], TSIMMIS <ref> [2] </ref>, and HERMES [14]. Broadly speaking, for each of a chosen set of queries, these systems provide a procedure to answer the query using the available sources. Given a new query, these systems attempt to answer it by relating it to the set of known queries.

Reference-contexts: The topic of interest is generally indicated by an expression containing keywords, and the goal of the retrieval is to locate documents from which a human reader can extract useful information. A number of systems | such as NTT Data's InterInfo 1 in the commercial realm and Amalthaea <ref> [11] </ref> in the realm of agent research | are providing increasingly sophisticated approaches to document retrieval. 1.1 Structured and Semistructured Information Sources An equally important set of challenges, but one that has not yet become as widely recognized, exists in the area of structured and semistructured information sources.
