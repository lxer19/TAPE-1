Reference-contexts: While book-like electronic media like CD-ROMs and diskettes are processed in libraries very similarly to print media, remotely stored electronic publications bring upon us changes that effect all phases of collection development. Selection criteria for purchasing material probably remain more or less as before <ref> (Nisonger, 1996) </ref>, but it might be more difficult to obtain evaluative information (e.g., book reviews) about electronic material. In January 1997, the first journal devoted to providing such evaluative information was launched 1 and may find a lot of approval among acquisitions librarians. 1 Electronic Resources Review, http://www.mcb.co.uk/liblink/err/jourhome.htm 6 U.
