Abstract: This paper describes multi-scale relaxation labeling for segmentation of fractal images. The images used are of pavement distress, on which simple edge detection schemes perform poorly. We use relaxation labeling to improve upon initial edge-based segmentation. Earlier work has shown that pavement distress can be well-modeled by fractals; the scale-invariance property of fractals suggests that information at different scales of resolution may be combined to improve segmentation. Thus, we have developed a multi-scale relaxation technique for use in a pavement distress detection system. To better model pixel interactions, we have included non-linear terms in the relaxation process. Symmetry arguments and careful engineering allow a 93% reduction in the complexity of this approach. To demonstrate the necessity of the multi-scale approach, examples with and without multi-scale relaxation are shown. We found that performance was greatly improved by multi-scale relaxation.

A more complicated non-linear model of pixel interactions was ultimately used, with attendant symmetry savings.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper describes the application of multi-scale relaxation to segment fractal images. Pavement distress (cracking) has been shown to be well-modeled by fractals <ref> [2] </ref>. This is a useful property which can be exploited to differentiate distress from the rest of the image. A fractal object or curve will appear to have the same fractal dimension, regardless of the scale that is used or the distance from the object [3].

Reference-contexts: We require that A + B + C = 1. The relaxation algorithm [5] adjusts these probabilities to make a pixel more consistent with is neighbors. Initially, zero crossings of a second directional derivative edge detector <ref> [4] </ref> are used to detect the boundaries in the image. After these boundaries have been detected, initial crack and aggregate regions are set up in the image using simple intensity value comparisons.
