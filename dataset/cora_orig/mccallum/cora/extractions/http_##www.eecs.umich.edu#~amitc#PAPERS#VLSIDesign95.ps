Reference-contexts: The effect of routability for varying switch box and connection box flexiblity has been studied and reported in <ref> [1] </ref> [4]. The channel width W obtained after routing the circuits using the sequential router is compared with the CGE router [3] in Table 3. It should be noted from Figures 7 and 8 that the router is capable of routing almost all nets with very small channel widths.

Reference-contexts: As results will show our router is capable of routing large industrial circuits with significantly smaller number of wiring segments. The channel width requirement is almost the same as that for CGE router by Brown et. al. <ref> [2] </ref>. In most cases we have observed that 95-99 % routing with channel width much less than that required by the CGE router is easily obtained by our router. Very few nets that are difficult to route in the later stages of routing increase the channel width locally.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2 illustrates a switch box and a connection box and their flexibilities respectively. The flexibilities of C and S boxes are shown in Figure 2. From now on, we will use the terms FPGA and LCA interchangeably. Brown et. al. <ref> [3] </ref> have developed a detailed router for LCAs that routes the two-terminal nets within their assigned global routes. The router, known as the Coarse Graph Expansion (CGE) router, expands the global route (coarse graph) of each net to find a detailed route. <p> The effect of routability for varying switch box and connection box flexiblity has been studied and reported in [1] [4]. The channel width W obtained after routing the circuits using the sequential router is compared with the CGE router <ref> [3] </ref> in Table 3. It should be noted from Figures 7 and 8 that the router is capable of routing almost all nets with very small channel widths. In fact in most cases the routability of as high as 98 % is obtained for substantially smaller channel widths. <p> For F s = 6 and F c = 0:6W , the total wire length in terms of the number of the used segments obtained by our router is always less than that obtained by the CGE router <ref> [3] </ref>. This is due to the fact that our router results in a Steiner tree type of final route for each multi-terminal net. This is usually less than the total length of the net if the net is decomposed into two-terminal nets. <p> Our results are the average case of topologies for switch box and connection box and compare well with the one reported in <ref> [3] </ref>. It should be noted that the channel width required for 100 % routing using our router is for a fully automated design.

Reference-contexts: A global route for a 1 In practice the multi-terminal router can save at most 33 % routing resources. This is due to the fact that Steiner trees are at most 33 % better than spanning trees over the same set of vertices <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 two-terminal net is a sequence of channel sections from one terminal to another. The search space for finding a detailed route is restricted to the assigned global route. The problem of finding detailed routes within the assigned global routes for FPGAs is NP-complete [8].

Reference-contexts: In worst case the path length can be as much as the cost of minimum spanning tree obtained for a net n k using Kruskal's method <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition the two terminal decomposition itself is time consuming as it takes O (p 2 ) time for a net with p terminals. 2. The input pins of a net are routed in the decreasing order of their Manhattan distances from the output pin of the net.

Reference-contexts: The channel density for the industrial circuits using our router are shown in Table 2. This channel density is compared with the density obtained after global routing by a modified version of the LocusRoute global router <ref> [7] </ref>. LocusRoute global router performs global routing for standard cell designs.

Reference-contexts: The two stage routing, i.e., global routing followed by the detailed routing is not very efficient. In fact, even in the presence of pre-defined routing architecture, the detailed routing problem in the presence of assigned global routes is NP-complete <ref> [8] </ref>. The results of Wu and Marek-Sadowska [8] are due to a graph based analysis of the routing architecture of logic cell arrays. We route multi-terminal nets directly after module placement. By doing so, we not only bypass the global routing but also enhance the probability of routing. <p> The two stage routing, i.e., global routing followed by the detailed routing is not very efficient.

In order to make full use of the available routing resources, nets are routed from the netlist description obtained after the placement of the modules, i.e., the global routing is bypassed.
