Title: Semi-automatic Differentiation  
Author: Thomas F. Coleman Fadil Santosa Arun Verma 
Date: October 29, 1997  
Abstract: We demonstrate how the structure that arises in inverse and optimal design problems can be used to aid in the efficient application of automatic differentiation ideas. We discuss the program structure of generic inverse problems and then illustrate, with two examples (one example involves the heat equation, the other involves wave propagation) how structure can be used in combination with automatic differentiation. Finally, we report numerical results and describe the ADMIT-2 software package which enables efficient derivative computation of structured problems.

Reference-contexts: Many inverse problems exhibit a time-stepping structure which can be exploited by applying the EASE (Extended functions And Structure Exploitation) scheme of Coleman and Verma <ref> [2, 1] </ref>. EASE provides an efficient way to compute the Newton step, and other derivative-related information, by exploiting the structure of the problem at hand. <p> In some cases this method might be more cost effective than the direct solve. EASE can be extended to Hessian computations, and allows for efficient computation of the Newton step (x = H 1 rf) and the true Hessian matrix from a (sparse) extended Hessian matrix <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Heat conductivity inverse problem To illustrate the structured application of AD in a concrete way, we consider a very simple inverse problem involving heat transfer. The problem is to find conductivity properties of a 1-dimensional bar whose predicted temperature evolution matches desired (or measured) behaviour. <p> Numerical results for heat equation problem The graph in figure 4 shows the effectiveness of EASE compared to the unstructured way of computing the Jacobian and Newton step. The size of the problem is N , the number of points in the discretization of spatial interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. It is easy to show that the unstructured method is quadratic in the dimension of the problem, but the EASE method is linear. Hence we can show an order of magnitude improvement over the dense, unstructured method.

Reference-contexts: Numerical Results for the wave equation problem for efficient computation of sparse Jacobian/Hessian matrices using the ADOL-C tool <ref> [4] </ref> for Automatic differentiation. ADMIT-2 builds on ADMIT-1, and provides efficient methods to compute the extended derivative matrices and the Newton step implementing EASE. ADMIT-2 recognizes different classes of real-world structured problems, such as inverse problems, partially separable problems, discrete-time optimal control problems etc.

Reference-contexts: In other words, we seek a model (or design) of earth which fits the data (or target) in the least squares sense. For a description of a complex reflection seismology inverse problem setting and more details on the nature of the problem, refer to Santosa and Symes <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper, we consider a simplified setup of the reflection seismology problem as shown in figure 5.

Reference-contexts: A related inverse problem in heat transfer 4 Fig. 2. 1-D inverse problem for the heat equation is described in Mukherjee et al <ref> [6] </ref>. The problem of solving for x (z) is phrased as a least-squares problem : min x (z) k tar () u (; T )k 2 : Computationally, this problem is solved using a discretization of spatial and time domains, and employing a suitable finite difference method.
