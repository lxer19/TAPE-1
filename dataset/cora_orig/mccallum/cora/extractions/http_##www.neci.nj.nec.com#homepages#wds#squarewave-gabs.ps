Abstract: is called the "square wave matrix." The ith row of A represents a 1-valued "square wave" function of j with half-period i. This paper shows that the inverse of the square wave matrix is sparse and its elements may be expressed in terms of the Mobius function from number theory; it follows that multiplying an N-vector by either A 1 or A (thus converting a waveform into a sum of squarewaves, or the reverse) may be very simply accomplished in O(N log N ) steps. This is a new kind of fast spectral transform, unrelated to the FFT. The same method can also be used to find the inverse of any matrix of the form
