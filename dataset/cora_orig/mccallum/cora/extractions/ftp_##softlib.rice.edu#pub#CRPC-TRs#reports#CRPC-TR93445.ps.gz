Title: Deterministic Parallel Fortran  
Author: K. Mani Chandy Ian Foster 
Abstract: We describe Fortran M, message-passing extensions to Fortran 77 that provide deterministic execution and information hiding while preserving desirable properties of message passing.

Reference-contexts: Hence, Fortran M can be used as a general-purpose modular framework for building earth system models on parallel computers <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 Data Parallelism The basic paradigm underlying Fortran M is task parallelism: the parallel execution of (possibly dissimilar) tasks. However, Fortran M also provides some support for data-parallel computation. Programs can use data distribution statements to create distributed arrays. Semantically, distributed arrays are indistinguishable from nondistributed arrays.

Reference-contexts: Fortran M's Extensions to Fortran 77 This paper provides an introduction to Fortran M. The reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref> for a detailed language description, a discussion of compiler techniques, and a survey of related work. A prototype Fortran M compiler for sequential and parallel computers is available from Argonne National Laboratory. <p> That is, the program is deterministic. This example is easily extended to incorporate parallel ocean and atmosphere models <ref> [3] </ref>. The atmosphere and ocean processes use process do-loops to create multiple subprocesses and the interface between the two components is defined in terms of arrays of channels.
