Reference-contexts: In recent years, an alternative closed-loop method has been proposed, whereby the endpoint is attached to the environment and no external sensors are required <ref> (Bennett and Hollerbach 1988, 1989, 1991) </ref>. A mechanism forms a single closed chain, which has to be mobile. Scenarios include a redundant manipulator with fixed endpoint or two nonredundant arms grasping. <p> For single closed-loop calibration (S J = 0) with rigid attachment (D J = 6) of the endpoint to the environment, all six loop closure equations are used, and the regular open-loop calibration procedure is applied with the measured location defined to be zero in position and orientation <ref> (Bennett and Hollerbach, 1988) </ref>. 3.2 C = 5 Lau et al. (1985) presented a steerable laser interferometer with steerable reflector. <p> These differential orthogonal rotations can be computed directly from the difference between measured and computed rotation matrices <ref> (Hollerbach and Bennett 1988) </ref>. 4.1 Task Variable Scaling Scaling is important for good numerical performance, but has not received that much attention in the calibration literature. <p> One common application is to fit a plane to a set of measured 3D points; all 3 components of measured position have noise. For example, this problem arises when measuring multiple points on an end effector and establishing a coordinate system <ref> (e.g., An et al. 1988) </ref>. Another example is circle point analysis, where a plane is to be fit to the circle of points generated by moving a single joint (Mooring et al. 1991). <p> If there is no brake, a very stiff servo with integral control would be necessary, and sufficient settling time must be allowed. If measurements are to be taken during a trajectory, then some form of iterative learning scheme is probably necessary <ref> (An et al. 1988) </ref>. Perhaps as a result, to date CPA has been applied only to the geometric factors. Another limitation is that the base parameters s 1 and 1 cannot be determined, because in the first joint screw the axis x 0 does not play a role.

Reference-contexts: The remaining DH parameters are straightforwardly found. For numerical stability, one again wishes to mix the Hayati parameters with the DH parameters for the case of nearly parallel joints. The details that handle all the various cases are presented in <ref> (Bennett et al. 1992) </ref>. 5.2 Jacobian Measurement Method Besides CPA, another screw axis measurement method is the Jacobian measurement method (Bennett et al. 1992, Hollerbach et al. 1993). <p> The details that handle all the various cases are presented in (Bennett et al. 1992). 5.2 Jacobian Measurement Method Besides CPA, another screw axis measurement method is the Jacobian measurement method <ref> (Bennett et al. 1992, Hollerbach et al. 1993) </ref>. The screw Jacobian J s matrix for an n-joint manipulator has the form: J s = z 0 z n1 Thus the columns of J s are the same joint screws (60) as determined by CPA.

Reference-contexts: To solve this equation, Press et al. (1992) proposed an iterative nonlinear optimization procedure. The formulation and solution of equations like (48) have appeared under various names and guises over the years, including total least squares (Van Huffel and Vandewalle 1991), orthogonal distance regression <ref> (Boggs et al. 1987) </ref>, or errors-in-variables regression (Fuller 1987). One common application is to fit a plane to a set of measured 3D points; all 3 components of measured position have noise. <p> As another simple example, suppose we are now trying to fit a scalar function y = f (x; a) by adjusting some parameters a <ref> (Boggs et al. 1987) </ref>. Assuming again equivalent error in x and y measurements, we should minimize the Euclidean distances from the measurements to the fitted curve f (Figure 5).

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, scaling is important for proper convergence in nonlinear optimization and for singular value decomposition. One wishes to examine the singular values for such reasons as optimum poses selection <ref> (Borm and Menq 1991) </ref> and elimination of redundant or unidentifiable parameters (Schroer 1993). Yet if parameters have vastly different magnitudes, then the singular values are not directly comparable. Another use of parameter scaling is incorporation of a priori information about likely parameter values into the performance index. <p> Major approaches towards quantifying observability involve an analysis of the singular values (36): the observability index <ref> (Borm and Menq 1991) </ref>, the condition number (Driels and Pathre 1990), and the minimum singular value (Nahvi et al. 1994). Assume that the rank has been determined and is r. <p> The observability index O BM was not as sensitive and not directly related to rms parameter errors.

Reference-contexts: Again, there is an issue of determining the covariances. As for the Gauss-Markov estimate, the expected value of 2 can be used to uniformly scale R and M post facto <ref> (Bryson and Ho 1975) </ref>. 4.3 Rank Determination Once all parameters have been scaled, singular value decomposition can be properly used to determine 11 identifiability of the kinematic parameters because the singular values are now comparable.

IEEE Intl. Conf. Robotics and Automation. </booktitle> <address> San Diego: </address> <pages> pp. 2776-2782. </pages>
Reference-contexts: The 3D position coordinates of the ball-joint would be provided by the measured calibrator joints. Instead of direct position measurement, another approach to CPA is the use of a triaxial accelerometer at the endpoint <ref> (Canepa et al. 1994) </ref>, 15 whose output is integrated. With the highly accurate accelerometers now on the market, precise calibration appears possible. Their advantage is portability and lack of viewing constraints. One complication in CPA is that there has to be a guarantee that the nonmoving joints are indeed stationary.

Reference-contexts: A recent novel device was presented by Renders et al. (1991), comprising a large-motion linear slide with small-motion orthogonal linear motions.

Eliminating the unsensed DOFs is easy in this case because the kinematic equations (8) decompose naturally into position and orientation equations. Thus simply throw away three of the six equations in (8) having to do with orientation.

For example, sliding joint and rotary joint variables cannot be directly combined when finding the minimum-norm least squares solution to the joint rates.

Reference-contexts: In each arm, there is an unsensed spherical wrist and sensed upper arm joints (S = 9). The unsensed wrist joints were eliminated by formulating a fixed distance constraint between wrist points. This approach is in principle the same as using a fixed ball bar <ref> (Driels 1993) </ref>, mentioned below for C = 1, between neighboring wrist points, where the unsensed spherical wrist joints are the kinematic equivalent of a ball joint.

Reference-contexts: For example, wrist force-torque sensors are known to suffer from cross coupling effects; a nominal accuracy of 0.5% for on-axis forces and torques can degrade to 3-4% for off-axis loading (Hirose and Yoneda 1990). With regard to joint torque sensors, the use of optical sensing may improve future accuracy <ref> (Hirose and Yoneda 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus the dimensions of the DH parameter vectors are usually N = L + 2. Although a variety of kinematic parameterizations have been proposed, the use of DH parameters is quite sufficient <ref> (Hollerbach 1989) </ref>. The case of nearly parallel neighboring joint axes is well handled by using the modified Hayati parameters (Hayati and Mirmirani 1983). The DH parameters represent the geometric components of the kinematic parameters.

Reference-contexts: For experimental robotics, without careful controls and calibration, the significance or veridicality of results cannot be gauged. We should expect to spend most of our experimental effort in calibration, relatively less in actually running the experiments in robot control <ref> (Hollerbach and Hunter 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, not all position or orientation components may be measured with equal accuracy. Ordinary least squares (16) weighs all task variables equally. To weigh these variables differently, the general solution is left multiplication of (17) by a scaling matrix G <ref> (Lawson and Hanson 1974) </ref>: ~ e = GC Gx ~ C ~ x (19) Then minimize the weighted index J W = ~ e T ~ e = e T G T Ge e T We (20) The well-known weighted least squares solution is: = ( ~ C where W = <p> In general, the measurement errors are not independent, and one must use the covariance matrix R = cov (x). If R = FF T is its Cholesky factorization, then define the weighting matrix W = F T F 1 . The weighted sum of squared errors then becomes <ref> (Lawson and Hanson 1974) </ref>: 2 = (F 1 e) T (F 1 e) = e T R 1 e (22) This corresponds to left multiplication of (17) by the matrix F 1 to yield: ~ e = F 1 e = F 1 C F 1 x ~ C ~ x <p> Another use of parameter scaling is incorporation of a priori information about likely parameter values into the performance index.

It makes sense to incorporate such an a priori preference 0 into the least squares optimization <ref> (Lawson and Hanson 1974) </ref>. To capture the notion of nearness, scale the squared parameter residual by a matrix K.

Reference-contexts: The orientation parameters are determined recursively by moving each joint to two positions, beginning with the base. At each of the two positions, the full endpoint pose is measured. A matrix equation is subsequently solved for the orientation parameters for each joint. In <ref> (Ma et al. 1994) </ref> a procedure was proposed for joint torque sensor calibration, using the arm's own gravity loading and the sinusoidal relation between joint torque and position. As a by product, the joint angle gains and offsets (2) are also determined. <p> Another variant involves measuring the Jacobian matrix, either with velocity sensing or with joint torque and endpoint wrench sensing. Joint angle offsets and gains can also be determined using joint torque sensing, as a side benefit of joint torque sensor calibration using an arm's gravity load <ref> (Ma et al. 1994) </ref>. It is interesting that measurements from the realm of kinetics can assist in calibration in the realm of kinematics.

Reference-contexts: The number of measured pose components can vary from 6 (full pose) to just 1 component of pose. In open-loop methods, individual poses are attained by moving all the joints, and the kinematic parameters are found from a nonlinear optimization of the total pose set <ref> (Mooring et al. 1991) </ref>. * Closed-loop methods. By attaching the end effector to the ground and forming a mobile closed kinematic chain, calibration is achieved using joint angle sensing only without any external metrology system (Bennett and Hollerbach 1991). <p> We also examine two methods which are not perfectly captured by this taxonomy. 2 Kinematic Loop Methods 2.1 Open-Loop Calibration The primary calibration method has been open-loop kinematic calibration, where a manipulator is placed in a number of poses and the complete or partial endpoint pose is measured <ref> (Mooring et al. 1991) </ref>. The phrase open-loop refers to an endpoint which is positioned freely in space. In the following, the developments are presented for all-rotary joint manipulators, but are easily recast to include prismatic joints. <p> For example, this problem arises when measuring multiple points on an end effector and establishing a coordinate system (e.g., An et al. 1988). Another example is circle point analysis, where a plane is to be fit to the circle of points generated by moving a single joint <ref> (Mooring et al. 1991) </ref>. Total least squares solves such equations analytically using singular value decomposition, making unnecessary the iterative solution proposed in Press et al. (1992). 4.5.1 Nonlinear Total Least Squares Even more pertinent to kinematic calibration, nonlinear versions of the total least squares problem have been developed. <p> From a knowledge of all of the joint screws, the kinematic parameters can be quite straightforwardly extracted. 5.1 Circle Point Analysis The main screw axis measurement method has been circle point analysis (CPA), where each joint is moved individually in a circle <ref> (Mooring et al. 1991) </ref>. The normal of the plane in which the circle lies and the center of the circle define the joint screw. In the past, position measurements of a point on the end effector have been used to define each circle (Stone 1987). <p> The problem is not serious because the base coordinate location is arbitrary, and so are these parameters. Different procedures have been proposed to extract the kinematic parameters from a knowledge of the joint axes <ref> (Mooring et al. 1991, Stone 1987) </ref>. An elegant method has been put forth by Sklar (1989), not well publicized except in (Mooring et al. 1991). <p> Different procedures have been proposed to extract the kinematic parameters from a knowledge of the joint axes (Mooring et al. 1991, Stone 1987). An elegant method has been put forth by Sklar (1989), not well publicized except in <ref> (Mooring et al. 1991) </ref>. Let each joint screw S j be represented as: S j = z j1 where z j1 is the joint j axis vector and b j is a vector from this axis to a fixed reference frame, such as the endpoint or an external measurement system.

Reference-contexts: ~ C ~ x (23) The performance index (22) is a 2 statistic, whose minimization for Gaussian distributions leads to the maximum likelihood estimate (Bevington 1992; Press et al. 1992): This solution is variously called the Gauss-Markov estimate, the generalized least squares estimate, or the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) <ref> (Norton 1986) </ref>. It is the minimum covariance estimate (on the parameter error) of all unbiased estimators. A significant point is that cov ( ~ x) = I, i.e., the uncertainty in components of ~ x are about the same size. <p> Thus scale R by -= 2 . Another approach is to treat the elements of R as additional variables to be estimated when (22) is minimized. The solution is then a pair of coupled nonlinear equations <ref> (Norton 1986) </ref> that yields both and R. 4.2 Parameter Scaling With regard to parameter scaling, in related applications such as redundancy resolution, problems created by improper scaling of joint variables have been identified (Doty et al. 1993). <p> Then cov ( ~ e ) = I, and hence the parameters are scaled evenly and are now comparable. After calibration, a revised estimate ^ M of the covariance can be derived from the data <ref> (Norton 1986) </ref>. This estimate can be used for subsequent SVD analysis for rank reduction. Assume that the task variables x have been previously scaled for equal uncertainty , that there is no bias (Ee = 0), and that the errors are uncorrelated (cov (e) = 2 I). <p> If input noise (in the joint angles) is significant, then bias errors may result; Appendix A provides a synopsis from <ref> (Norton 1986) </ref> that demonstrates this important fact. With few exceptions, this potential problem does not yet appear to have been generally addressed in the 13 calibration literature. As a simple example, consider the linear equation y = ax, where only the slope a is to be determined. <p> Personal support for JMH was provided by the NSERC/Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIAR) Industrial Research Chair in Robotics.

Reference-contexts: This section considers least squares methods, task variable scaling, parameter scaling, rank determination, pose selection, and handling input noise. We begin by describing the nonlinear iterative least squares method normally used to estimate the kinematic parameters. Because robot kinematics (6) are only mildly nonlinear <ref> (Schroer 1993) </ref>, linearization is an effective means for iteratively solving the nonlinear optimization and for qualitative analysis. x = @ where x is the error between measured and computed enddpoint position and orientation, C is the gradient or Jacobian, and is the correction to be applied to the 8 current parameter <p> Nevertheless, scaling is important for proper convergence in nonlinear optimization and for singular value decomposition. One wishes to examine the singular values for such reasons as optimum poses selection (Borm and Menq 1991) and elimination of redundant or unidentifiable parameters <ref> (Schroer 1993) </ref>. Yet if parameters have vastly different magnitudes, then the singular values are not directly comparable. Another use of parameter scaling is incorporation of a priori information about likely parameter values into the performance index.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that input noise leads to bias errors in estimation. The method to handle input noise is total least squares or orthogonal distance regression. An extension is the Implicit Loop Method <ref> (Wampler et al. 1995) </ref>, which is based on the viewpoint of all calibration methods as 2 closed-loop methods (leading to an implicit constraint equation) and which places all measurements (whether joint or endpoint) on an equal footing. 1.3 Screw Axis Measurement The last section reviews screw axis measurement methods, which determine <p> Define = 0 + e , where is the true parameter value vector and e is the error <ref> (Wampler et al. 1995) </ref>. Incorporate 0 as constants into (6), which then becomes x = f ( e ). The problem now is to estimate the error e , by iterative least squares adding corrections e as in (18). <p> Following the development in 14 <ref> (Wampler et al. 1995) </ref>, an implicit equation results from the unifying view of open-loop kinematic calibration methods as closed-loop methods. <p> Total least squares and orthogonal distance regression are methods that handle input noise.

Reference-contexts: These observability measures have direct parallels in the literature on dexterity measures for redundancy resolution of manipulators (Table 1). The manipulability index q been proposed <ref> (Yoshikawa 1985) </ref> to quantify configurations, where J is the rank l Jacobian and the j 's are its singular values. The manipulability index is directly analogous to the observability index O BM , as they both involve the product of the singular values.

Reference-contexts: With regard to joint torque sensors, the use of optical sensing may improve future accuracy (Hirose and Yoneda 1989). With improvements in inertial sensors, the use of endpoint velocity sensing could potentially be sufficiently accurate. This method has not yet been implemented. 5.3 Other Methods In <ref> (Zhuang and Roth 1993) </ref> a linear identification method was presented that is neither a kinematic loop method nor a screw axis measurement method, but is listed here because it shares the feature of CPA of moving one joint at a time. The orientation parameters are determined before the displacement parameters.
