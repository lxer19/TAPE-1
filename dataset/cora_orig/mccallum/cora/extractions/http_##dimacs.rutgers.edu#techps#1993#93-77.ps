Reference-contexts: This is an analog of a theorem of G. Freiman which describes the structure of such sets in the group of integers. Let A be a set of integers, jAj = n, and suppose that jA + Aj cn. A famous theorem of Freiman <ref> [1, 2] </ref> provides a certain structural description of these sets; in one of the possible formulations, it says that A can be covered by a generalized arithmetic progression fa + q 1 x 1 + q 2 x 2 + ::: + q d x d : 0 x i l

Reference-contexts: ffn (in particular, if jA + Aj ffn or jA Aj ffn), then A is contained in a subgroup H of G such that jHj f (r; ff)n; where f (r; ff) = ff 2 r ff 4 The proof goes along similar lines to my proof of Freiman's theorem <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, but is consid erably simpler. For a nonnegative integer k and a set A G we introduce the notation kA = A + ::: + A; k summands; 0A = f0g; 1A = A: Lemma. <p> If A; B G, jBj = n and jA+Bj ffn, then for arbitrary nonnegative integers k; l we have jkA lAj ff k+l n: See <ref> [3] </ref>, Lemma 3.3. Proof of the Theorem. Let b 1 ; b 2 ; :::; b k be a maximal collection of elements such that b i 2 2A A and the sets b i A are all disjoint.
