Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the last lecture, we covered the material on the effective bandwidth for multiplexed multiple time-scale traffic (see <ref> [1] </ref>). In this lecture summary, we examine the relationship between such effective bandwidth and the statistical multiplexing gain (SMG). We then define the Renegotiated Constant Bit Rate Service (RCBR see [2]).

In this lecture summary, we examine the relationship between such effective bandwidth and the statistical multiplexing gain (SMG). We then define the Renegotiated Constant Bit Rate Service (RCBR see <ref> [2] </ref>). <p> They demonstrate that the RCBR are able to extract most of the statistical multiplexing gain. Those figures can be found in the reader <ref> [2] </ref>.
