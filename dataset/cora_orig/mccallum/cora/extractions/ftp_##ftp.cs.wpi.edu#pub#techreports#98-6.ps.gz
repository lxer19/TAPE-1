Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The exploration of large information spaces remains a challenging task especially with the growth of the World Wide Web and other such huge repositories <ref> [AS94] </ref>. Many users are not able to cope with the flood of information. Visual Information Seeking (VIS) addresses this problem by recognizing the enormous capacity of human visual information processing [AS94]. <p> information spaces remains a challenging task especially with the growth of the World Wide Web and other such huge repositories <ref> [AS94] </ref>. Many users are not able to cope with the flood of information. Visual Information Seeking (VIS) addresses this problem by recognizing the enormous capacity of human visual information processing [AS94]. By presenting information visually and allowing user interaction through direct-manipulation, users can traverse larger information spaces in shorter time [Shn92]. <p> Our goal is to apply the concept of VIS to special-purpose data types such as spatial and temporal data, as to the best of our knowledge VIS has up to now only been applied to simple numeric data types <ref> [AS94] </ref> [WS92]. Our previous work focussed on designing a direct manipulation environment for one-dimensional temporal data, called TVQL [HR97] [HR96a] [HR96b] [HR98a], that allowed a user to visually specify temporal queries over video data giving an instantaneous visualization of the results of the query. <p> Visual query environments based on VIS [Shn92] [WS92] are typically restricted to simple numeric domains. The Dynamic Homefinder, a Real Estate Information Exploration System based on VIS [WS92], allows users to search for a house that meets their criteria by manipulating sliders <ref> [AS94] </ref> for different input parameters (such as number of rooms, price, distance from a fixed point, etc). However, it does not allow the user to specify the relative spatial position of two objects. Our goal is to provide a new class of dynamic filters tuned for continuous spatial querying.

Our goal is to provide a new class of dynamic filters tuned for continuous spatial querying. Most existing spatial query languages are textual (SQL-based) <ref> [Ege94] </ref>. The possibly most popular GIS system MapInfo fl uses an SQL-style language to specify queries to query primarily over non-spatial and a few spatial attributes such as area and distance of the underlying data.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 shows the positions of the sliders for the refined query. In order to prevent the specification of illegal queries, constraints and dependencies are introduced between the sliders so that only legal combinations of values can be specified using our interface <ref> [KR97] </ref>. fl Axl, Axr, Bxl, Bxr are the extremities of A and B in the X dimension. Ayt, Ayb, Byt, Byb are the extremities of A and B along the Y dimension. We assume that each object has a finite non-zero width and height. <p> The tight coupling between S-sliders and APIQ achieved by our mapping functions gives new settings of the S-sliders as a result of the direct manipulation of APIQ <ref> [KR97] </ref>. The resulting APIQ and S-sliders [KR97], consistent with the integrated neighborhood model, are shown in Figure 5. As demonstrated, APIQ increases the utility of SVIQUEL for spatial browsing with no particular query in mind. <p> The tight coupling between S-sliders and APIQ achieved by our mapping functions gives new settings of the S-sliders as a result of the direct manipulation of APIQ <ref> [KR97] </ref>.
