Abstract: The dominant theme of case-based research at recent ML conferences has been on classifying cases represented by feature vectors. However, other useful tasks can be targeted, and other representations are often preferable. We review the recent literature on case-based learning, focusing on alternative performance tasks and more expressive case representations. We also highlight topics in need of additional research.

Reference-contexts: The CBR problem solving cycle <ref> (Aamodt & Plaza, 1994) </ref> contains four steps: 1. Retrieval: Retrieve a set of cases whose problems are similar to the query. 2. Reuse: Apply the retrieved cases' solutions to solve the query. 3. Revision: Evaluate this solution, and revise it as necessary. 4.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we outline some open CBL research issues in Section 3. Space constraints prevent us from reviewing CBL research on classifying feature vectors here, which is the focus of <ref> (Aha, 1997a) </ref>. 2 Case representation and case-based learning We begin by describing the CBR problem solving cycle and its knowledge sources, and then use them to organize our brief description of relevant CBL research. The CBR problem solving cycle (Aamodt & Plaza, 1994) contains four steps: 1.

Reference-contexts: For example, CAPlan/CbC (Mu~noz-Avila & Hullen, 1996) learns feature weights to index plan descriptions, and RUNNER (Seifert et al., 1994) learns operator application conditions and uses them to index cases represented by semantic networks. Hamlet <ref> (Borrajo & Veloso, 1997) </ref> learns to improve its search efficiency and resulting plan quality by incrementally refining its control rules using a CBL approach.

These integrations frequently use CBL in innovative fashions.

Reference-contexts: More robust techniques are needed for learning and modifying constraints in case-based planning and design systems (Avesani et al., 1993; Purvis & Pu, 1995). Several case-based systems, especially those that target legal analysis, learn to synthesize explanatory arguments for (and sometimes also against) specific decisions <ref> (e.g., Branting, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Also needed are techniques for validating the behavior of case revision operators, and further research on how abstraction can be used to reduce search without requiring that solutions be downward refinable <ref> (Branting & Aha, 1995) </ref>. 3.2 Synthesis performance tasks Most CBL research has focussed on analysis (e.g., classification) rather than synthesis (e.g., design, planning) tasks. It is not clear what modifications of techniques for classifying feature vectors are needed for synthesis tasks.

Reference-contexts: These require structural similarity functions, and the performance task is typically design construction rather than classification. Other performance tasks also typically influence choices for representing cases. For example, CIBL <ref> (Branting & Broos, 1997) </ref> learns the concept of a preference pair, where each case is an ordered pair of states (feature vectors) in which the first is preferable to the second. Given a new pair of states, it predicts which is preferable.

Reference-contexts: Sequential problem-solving tasks, such as two person games, often demand complex case representations. Kerner's (1995) chess player represents cases as frames that serve as explanation patterns to evaluate game patterns. He described several learning operators for modifying them. CABOT <ref> (Callan et al., 1991) </ref>, an Othello player, represents cases as hstate,movei pairs. Given a query, it retrieves a most similar (game) state, and then uses a second similarity computation to select the move that best mimics the retrieved case's implicit state changes.

Krovvidy and Wee's (1993) CBL system saves partial planning solutions and learns heuristics for selecting them during problem solving.

Reference-contexts: Horn clauses have also been used to represent cases. Grolimund and Ganascia (1995) used them for an optimization task. Their learning algorithm stores and reuses operator selection experience during a tabu search. RIBL <ref> (Emde & Wettschereck, 1996) </ref>, a first-order classifier, instead constructs cases from mul-tirelational data and computes the similarities between arbitrarily complex cases. Finally, Malek and Rialle (1994) described a medical diagnosis task and learning procedures for modifying Horn clause cases. <p> Case-based learning systems can assist in data mining activities in several ways. For example, CBL can be used to locate extreme cases (i.e., gems) that are of particular interest. Also, CBL is a promising approach for mining in multi-relational databases <ref> (Emde & Wettschereck, 1996) </ref>, which has not yet been extensively investigated even though many large databases employ relational representations.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge on the adaptability of retrieved cases can also be used to successfully bias retrieval behavior (Smyth & Keane, 1995a). 2.3 Learning adaptation knowledge Learned adaptation knowledge can be used to bias the case vocabulary. For example, ROBBIE <ref> (Fox & Leake, 1995) </ref> uses constructive induction to learn new indices by estimating their ability to retrieve more easily adapted cases.

Reference-contexts: The following subsections summarize CBL research that targets one or more of these containers. We focus on research that either uses alternatives to feature vector representations for cases and/or addresses tasks other than classification. 2.1 Alternative representations for describing cases Several representations for cases have been investigated <ref> (Gebhardt, 1996) </ref>. For example, cases in case-based design systems (Maher et al., 1996; Borner, 1995; Surma & Braunschweig, 1996) are complex design artifacts. These require structural similarity functions, and the performance task is typically design construction rather than classification. Other performance tasks also typically influence choices for representing cases.

Reference-contexts: Adaptation knowledge can also be learned by integrating case- and rule-based approaches (Leake et al., 1996), by evolutionary algorithms (Hunt, 1995), or by analyzing case comparisons <ref> (Hanney & Keane, 1996) </ref>. CARMA (Hastings et al., 1995) instead learns weights on adaptation operators. Approaches that annotate case solutions with explicit justification knowledge for guiding reuse and revision employ a form of adaptation known as derivational analogy. This is most often used in planning tasks.

Reference-contexts: Messmer and Bunke (1995) described a TDIDT approach that allows graph-structured cases to be retrieved in polynomial time, but it trades off exponential space. Applying tree simplification strategies (e.g., pruning) can decrease space requirements, but they also reduce gains in computational efficiency. In contrast, cases in CABINS <ref> (Miyashita & Sycara, 1993) </ref> are schedules; it improves their quality using an iterative refinement process. Ramsey and Grefenstette (1994) defined a case as a (genetically induced) rule population. Their CBL algorithm uses environmental cues to select which population to use in response to concept drifts.
