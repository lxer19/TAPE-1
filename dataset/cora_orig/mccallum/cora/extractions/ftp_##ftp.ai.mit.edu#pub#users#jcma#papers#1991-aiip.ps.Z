Abstract: Semantic content analysis differs from traditional computerized content analysis because it operates on the referentially integrated, meaning representation of a text instead of a linear string of words. Rather than assessing the thematic orientation of texts based on the frequencies of word occurrences, this new methodology examines and interprets explicit knowledge representations of texts. There are three phases to a semantic content analysis: - phrases in surface semantics). Word senses are semantically disambiguated by incorporating selection constraints into the descriptions that select correct lexical realizations. An advanced definition interface allows users to supply English sentences or noun phrases to specify constraint descriptions that retrieve and label lexical realizations. This frees the user from the need to know the details of the constraint language. Composite patterns can be detected by hierarchical application of lexical recognizers. Beyond semantic content analysis, lexical classification expands the referential performance because it provides a basic inference mechanism to extend indexation, semantically disambiguate word senses, and provide criteria for further deliberation in reference.

Reference-contexts: This may, in turn, lead to differential problem framing. 3.4.4 Recognizing Argument Connectives Computational argument analysis can provide a formal basis for regrounding political science <ref> (Alker, 1988a) </ref>. Minsky (1987) suggests that arguments can be treated like proofs, except that the logical chain operates at a higher level of abstraction and makes larger, less justified steps. Lexical classification could recognize argument connectives if they were explicit.

Reference-contexts: Lexical classification could recognize argument connectives if they were explicit. Unfortunately, most precomputational theories of argument seem to be AI- complete, or require arbitrary inferences to identify the connective relationships. Largely syntactic theories emphasizing explicit lexical markers possibly Rescher's (1977) dialogical theory of argument which has shown political relevance <ref> (Alker, 1988b) </ref> could be usefully recognized. This kind of application for lexical classification shades into parsing semantic structures, and in principle, could even extend to complete deductive inference (McAllester & Givan, 1989). 4 Conclusions Lexical classification for text models yields the new methodology of semantic content analysis.

Reference-contexts: Its communitarian orientation is reflected in Butterworth's inclusion of symbolic actions in addition to the usual realist instrumental actions. The symbolic social interactions include numerous speech acts (Searle, 1969) through which parties express commitments, directives, acknowledgments, and information <ref> (Bach & Harnish, 1979) </ref>. Figures 9, 10, 11 use semantic content analysis to view the Hungary story through the prism of speech acts. In international politics, Bennett (1987) characterizes nuclear deterrence between the superpowers as a social relationship whose evolution is mediated by symbolic actions, specifically the speech acts. <p> Instead, they have specialization, generalization, and equality relationships to situate them taxonomically with respect to base categories or other abstract categories. 47 Figure 8 shows the hierarchical organization of categories for a lexical classification system that identifies speech acts <ref> (Bach & Harnish, 1979) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The need to deliberate about referents is certainly signalled by contradictory, incommensurate, or non-existent referents as well as violation of selection constraints for word senses, semantic or pragmatic ambiguity, or conversational inadequacy (Searle, 1979; Levinson, 1983: 157-158). But it also seems required to find coherent interpretations of discourse situations <ref> (Hobbs, 1979, 1986) </ref>. 11 11 Roger Hurwitz (personal communication, Spring, 1989) notes a deconstructive component to deliberative reference.

Reference-contexts: The texts each run about ten pages and create about 6000 graph structure nodes each. The coding employed Winston's (1980) conventions, making liberal use of the connective `because' to create causal relations between clauses. These connectives allowed the Winston analogy system, and later the RELATUS analogy routines <ref> (Mallery & Hurwitz, 1987) </ref>, to follow causal relations and formulate analogies. <p> A better alternative is to devise test vectors for natural language systems that identify failures for implementors to correct and determine if they cover their advertised processing model. Beyond coding issues, different text types may have important consequences for the validity of lexical classifiers <ref> (Hurwitz & Mallery, 1987) </ref>. Propaganda or insincere texts can produce spurious results for classifiers devised for sincere texts. Insincere texts make inferential demands beyond the processing model and would produce spurious classifications due to inaccurate coding. <p> unanticipated sources of erroneous classifications remain, at least, text modeling allows explicit, reproducible representation and analysis of texts. 3.4.2 Precedent Logics The various types of precedential reasoning, such as precedents repeated over time, analogies, and metaphor are distinguished by the inductive distance between the target situation and the source situation <ref> (Mallery & Hurwitz, 1987) </ref>. For an AI system to retrieve source situations for a given target, it is necessary to make a match specification which generalizes the target situation.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the quality of precedent search increases as the classification of semantic memory becomes richer and more fine-grained. 49 3.4.3 Modeling Differential Perception Lexical classification opens the possibility of formally modeling differential classifications or "differential perceptions" <ref> (Jervis, 1976) </ref>. Here is how it could work. First, assume no convergence in the lexical classification systems of actors and construct them independently. This will help prevent bias in favor of convergence.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the implementation adds a constraint to suppress the unknown, preventing it from appearing in the answer. The advantage of this approach for question answering is that it does not require ad hoc manipulations of syntactic parse graphs <ref> (Katz, 1988) </ref> for questions to produce a query specification. <p> Although it is not presently implemented, backward chaining to infer implicit answers <ref> (Katz, 1988) </ref> would enhance question answering. Figure 11 shows some examples of RELATUS answering questions. In general, questions are correctly and robustly answered to the extent that the question parses and references correctly so that semantic inversion can build correct constraints that pick out the right answer.

Reference-contexts: Drawing knowledge directly from long-term social memory (text) into computer systems <ref> (Lenat & Guha, 1990) </ref>, provides one of the few ways to increase the productivity of social science and extend its ability to effectively cope with the expanding complexities of the modern world. <p> scientific point is that the distinction between immediate and deliberative reference provides a theoretical framework to decompose AI-complete natural language understanding into a bootstrap succession of simpler, independent extensions fixed interpretive templates for standard metaphors cover a surprising number of cases arising in his project to develop encyclopedic knowledge bases <ref> (Lenat & Guha, 1990) </ref>. 16 This referential competence sketches a foundation for a computational theory of something like a "universal pragmatics" or a communication theory social action (Habermas, 1979, 1981). 17 By analogy to NP-completeness in complexity theory, Fanya S. <p> This decision science would build from a structural theory of rationality whose inferential capabilities draw from research to create unified theories of cognition (Newell, 1989) but whose noetic foundation is in text modeling. Access to the gnoosphere (collective human knowledge) through the development of encyclopedic knowledge bases <ref> (Lenat & Guha, 1990) </ref>, especially text models derived from the literature on international politics, could provide grist for the mill.

Reference-contexts: Largely syntactic theories emphasizing explicit lexical markers possibly Rescher's (1977) dialogical theory of argument which has shown political relevance (Alker, 1988b) could be usefully recognized. This kind of application for lexical classification shades into parsing semantic structures, and in principle, could even extend to complete deductive inference <ref> (McAllester & Givan, 1989) </ref>. 4 Conclusions Lexical classification for text models yields the new methodology of semantic content analysis. Analysts can use this method to rigorously and reproducibly simulate classifications in political texts and political action.

Reference-contexts: Since RELATUS retains the original lexical items from sentences, the resulting semantic representations are lexicalist and referential opacity is the norm <ref> (Maida & Shapiro, 1982) </ref>. Semantic perception does not substitute equals for many cases. 9 Substi- tution of equals across opaque contexts never takes place; instead identity relations may be asserted after valid equalities are determined.

Reference-contexts: The intended perlocutionary effects arise because the labels elicit particular ways of framing the problem, or "seeing-as" (Wittgenstein, 1953), and from these stereotypical, or "natural" political responses follow. Examples such as this suggest that classification is a fundamental political act <ref> (Mefford, 1988a) </ref> standing behind conflict and cooperation. The basic cognitive process at work in classification involves an interplay between the micro-classifications of actions and relationships that call forth particular constructions of situations. These constructions, in turn, demand concordant micro classifications. 1 Paul Ricoeur (1971) has dubbed this the double hermeneutic.

This decision science would build from a structural theory of rationality whose inferential capabilities draw from research to create unified theories of cognition <ref> (Newell, 1989) </ref> but whose noetic foundation is in text modeling. Access to the gnoosphere (collective human knowledge) through the development of encyclopedic knowledge bases (Lenat & Guha, 1990), especially text models derived from the literature on international politics, could provide grist for the mill.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, universalist semantics (Katz and Fodor, 1963; Schank, 1972; Schank and Abelson, 1977) advocates determining equivalent meanings (paraphrases) through the decomposition of different surface forms to a canonical semantic form composed of semantic universals, such as "conceptual dependency" primitives <ref> (Schank and Abelson, 1977) </ref>. But, lexicalist semantic theories argue that most meaning equivalences must be determined constructively for specific linguistic communities (or even individual language users) and dynamically for the intentional context. The experimental psycholinguistics supports the lexicalist position (Fodor, et al., 1980; Gentner & Landers, 1985).

Reference-contexts: The Butterworth's Brezinski-inspired account of the 1956 Hungarian Intervention is the source of examples for this paper. Its communitarian orientation is reflected in Butterworth's inclusion of symbolic actions in addition to the usual realist instrumental actions. The symbolic social interactions include numerous speech acts <ref> (Searle, 1969) </ref> through which parties express commitments, directives, acknowledgments, and information (Bach & Harnish, 1979). Figures 9, 10, 11 use semantic content analysis to view the Hungary story through the prism of speech acts.

In April 1988, the author created a 250,000 node representation of 14 SHERFACS cases. Later in August, a lexical classification system was developed to identify Sherman conflict actions categories (Mallery, 1988c). <p> This system also suffers from the absence of selectional constraints. * SHERFACS Actions: A lexical classification system was defined for application to narrative precis automatically generated (Mallery, 1988b) from the SHERFACS International Conflict Management Dataset <ref> (Sherman, 1987a, 1987b, 1988) </ref>. This system categorizes the various actions that a political actor may take in conflicts as coded in SHERFACS. These action categories include the COPDAB categories (Azar, 1982). 60 3.4 Analytical Applications 3.4.1 Semantic Content Analysis The immediate political-analytic application of lexical classification is semantic content analysis.

Reference-contexts: Since these inferences may also draw on arbitrary knowledge accumulated over a lifetime of social relations and social communications, effective study of the internal reference conundrum requires a division into simpler, "nearly decomposable" <ref> (Simon, 1962) </ref> components. The theory behind the RELATUS reference system envisions two categories of internal reference: * Immediate Reference simply looks up literal relations from explicit representa <br>- tions in memory. * Deliberative Reference relies on reasoning, which may be arbitrarily complex, to select possible referents.

Reference-contexts: reordering the list rather than exponential, tree-descent copying of parse structure. 30 The parser has quite broad coverage of English grammar. 31 The parser incorporates a categorial disambiguator (Duffy, 1986) that identifies the correct part of speech for each word in a sentence by means of a constraint propagation scheme <ref> (Waltz, 1975) </ref>. When an ambiguous category is encountered, the disambiguator exploits constraints propagated from its neighbors. Thus, the successful disambiguation of one ambiguity in a sentence propagates additional constraint which may be helpful in disambiguating other ambiguities.
