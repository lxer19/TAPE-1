Reference-contexts: To address these problems, we feel that a free and highly portable interactive system that can illustrate important and fundamental concepts is required. 2 Related Work Although surface design is important in graphics, CAD and computer aided geometric design <ref> [2, 1] </ref>, there are only a handful pedagogical aids. Rockwood and Chambers' multimedia tutorial [3] runs on Microsoft Windows with an emphasis more or less on the curve part. Yen's Knotty [4] is a video program explaining important features of B-Spline and NURBS curves and surfaces. <p> Students can change the position of a control point to modify the shape of the surface. The surface is in parametric form mapping (u; v) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1] to a point p (u; v) on the surface. <p> Students can change the position of a control point to modify the shape of the surface. The surface is in parametric form mapping (u; v) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1] to a point p (u; v) on the surface. For B-Spline and NURBS surfaces, the u- and v-direction are further subdivided with knots 0 u 0 u 1 : : : u p 1 and 0 v 0 v 1 v 2 : : : v q 1. <p> Figure 1 shows a NURBS surface and its control points and control net. The position of (u; v) is controlled by the upper-right window. As (u; v) moves in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1], our system can display on-the-fly the point p (u; v) on surface. The knots, shown on the bottom side and left side of [0; 1]fi [0; 1], can also be changed to modify the shape of the surface. <p> Figure 1 shows a NURBS surface and its control points and control net.

The position of any control point can be changed to modify the shape of the surface. <p> For example, the inner working of de Casteljau's algorithm (for Bezier and rational Bezier surfaces) and de Boor's algorithm (for B-Spine and NURBS surfaces). With this capability activated, all intermediate computations along the u- and v-direction are displayed as shown in Figure 2. As (u; v) moves in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1], the whole configuration moves accordingly. Therefore, students learn the way of generating a point on the surface. For portability reasons, we only use OpenGL and GLUT. <p> With this capability activated, all intermediate computations along the u- and v-direction are displayed as shown in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Yen's Knotty [4] is a video program explaining important features of B-Spline and NURBS curves and surfaces. Neither provides an interactive environment for students to carry out experiments. A fully interactive system is being developed by Zhao et al. <ref> [5] </ref> in which students can interactively create, edit and modify one or more curves on screen. 3 Approach and Uniqueness Our system supports four types of surfaces: Bezier, rational Bezier, B-spline, and NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) surfaces.
