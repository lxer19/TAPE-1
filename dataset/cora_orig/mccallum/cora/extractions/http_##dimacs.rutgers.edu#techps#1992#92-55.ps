Reference-contexts: In Section 4 we formulate the duality statement for the max-cut problem. We also discuss a relation to the optimality certificate introduced in <ref> [5] </ref>. In the last section we propose a computational framework where the two approaches are combined. Notation. We fix some notation that will be used throughout paper. G = (V; E) denotes a graph on n nodes, with node set V and edge set E. <p> We use a notation different from the previous sections for two reasons; (i) to avoid confusion with the minimization problem, and (ii) the notation '(G; c) has already been used in <ref> [5] </ref>. The node-relaxation '(G; c) was introduced in [5] as '(G; c) := min n max (L + diag (u)) (56) Let us note that (56) is nothing else but '(G; c) := min n max x t (L + diag (u))x (57) when using the Rayleigh quotient to express max <p> We use a notation different from the previous sections for two reasons; (i) to avoid confusion with the minimization problem, and (ii) the notation '(G; c) has already been used in <ref> [5] </ref>. The node-relaxation '(G; c) was introduced in [5] as '(G; c) := min n max (L + diag (u)) (56) Let us note that (56) is nothing else but '(G; c) := min n max x t (L + diag (u))x (57) when using the Rayleigh quotient to express max , and thus (57) is quite analogous to <p> Now it is easy to see that (62) and (63) are equivalent to (56). 2 In the rest of this section, we show the way in which the optimum solution Y of (58) is related to the optimality certificate formulated in <ref> [5] </ref>. Let (G; c) be a weighted graph and u 2 U . Let (z 1 ; : : : ; z m ) = (z im ) 2 Eig ( max (L + diag (u)) be a collection of m eigenvectors. <p> m X z 2 ij = 1 for every i = 1; : : : ; n: (71) Let us say that u fl 2 U is an optimum correcting vector for (G; c) if '(G; c) := n 4 max (L + diag (u fl )): 19 Theorem 4.2 <ref> [5] </ref> Let u 2 U . Then u is the optimum correcting vector if and only if there exists an optimality certificate for u. 2 The next theorem describes the mutual relation between an optimal Y in the edge-relaxation (58) and an optimality certificate. <p> Then x determines a cut of size '(G; c), and hence mc (G; c) = '(G; c). However, it is NP-hard to determine the minimum size of an optimality certificate ([6]). The optimality certificate from <ref> [5] </ref> recalled in Theorem 4.2 is related to an optimality criterion of Overton, formulated in [12] for a more general problem. We will re-phrase this criterion. Let (G; c) be a weighted graph, and u 2 U .

Reference-contexts: We distinguish three cases. Case (i). Assume that the eigenvalue min M (s; t) is simple. Using e.g. Theorem 2 of <ref> [7] </ref>, we get that the function g (s; t) is differentiable at the point (s; t), and its partial derivatives are given by @g (s; t) = i=1 x 2 @g (s; t) = ( i=1 x i ) 2 where x = (x i ) is the eigenvector of min

Reference-contexts: The gap-inequalities with fl = 1 are called the hypermetric inequalities, and have been quite intensively studied in the literature. An important theoretical result about the hypermetric inequalities was proved in <ref> [8] </ref>, telling that, for every n, the hypermetric inequalities define a polytope. The use of hypermetric inequalities in max-cut computation, and a heuristic search for violated ones, was proposed by G. Rinaldi and C.

Reference-contexts: This shows the equivalence of the two approaches. Remark 2.4 One of the early relaxations of graph partitioning was proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>. In the case of bisections, this approach amounts to optimizing over all matrices X satisfying just the orthogonality constraints described above. <p> On the other hand, it was proved in [15] that the ratio (G;c) mc (G;c) tends to 2 for a certain class of random graphs (with c e = 1 for e 2 E (G)). 5.2 Eigenvalue Approach The earliest experiments based on the eigenvalue approach are reported in <ref> [9] </ref>. However, the bound considered there was not the best possible for the approach. The computational experiments with the bound -(G; c; 0) (graph bisection into equal sizes) are reported in [10], and the bound '(G; c) on the max-cut problem is computed in [14].

Reference-contexts: An important theoretical result about the hypermetric inequalities was proved in [8], telling that, for every n, the hypermetric inequalities define a polytope. The use of hypermetric inequalities in max-cut computation, and a heuristic search for violated ones, was proposed by G. Rinaldi and C. De Simone <ref> [16] </ref> at the workshop on graph partition problems at Rome 1991. 24 The class of inequalities (89) contains all hypermetric inequalities. We propose to search for possible violated inequalitites (89) in the `neighbourhood' of the eigenspace of min ( 1 2 J X), but details will be elaborated elsewhere. Acknowledgement.

Reference-contexts: That is, b (G; c; k) := min X c ij Clearly, the integer k has to satisfy 0 k n, and n k 0 (mod 2). We will call any such k admissible. 4 Rendl and Wolkowicz <ref> [17] </ref> introduced in an equivalent form (see the remark at the end of this Section) the following lower bound -(G; c; k) on the bisection width. <p> Let -(G; c; k) := max min n x t (L + diag (u))x (10) where U , X k and the Laplacian matrix L = L (G; c) were defined above.

Reference-contexts: Thus, y is a feasible solution of the above program, and hence (G; c; k) b (G; c; k): 2 In subsection 5.4 the condition (12), which is equivalent to (5) is further strengthened. We also point out that A. Schrijver <ref> [19] </ref> proposed formulation (12) with Y instead of y to derive tractable relaxations of the max-cut problem. This formulation of Schrijver was in fact the motivation for the approach described in the present paper.
