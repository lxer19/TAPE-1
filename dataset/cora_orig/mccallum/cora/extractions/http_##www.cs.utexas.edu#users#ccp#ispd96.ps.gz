Abstract: In this paper, we consider non-uniform wire-sizing. Given a wire segment of length L, let f(x) be the width of the wire at position x, 0 x L. We show that the optimal wire-sizing function that minimizes the Elmore delay through the wire is f(x) = ae bx , where a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 are constants that can be computed in O(1) time. In the case where lower bound (L &gt; 0) and upper bound (U &gt; 0) on the wire widths are given, we show that the optimal wire-sizing function f(x) is a truncated version of ae bx that can also be determined in O(1) time. Our wire-sizing formula can be iteratively applied to optimally size the wire segments in a routing tree.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As VLSI technology continues to scale down, interconnect delay has become the dominant factor in deep submi-cron designs. As a result, wire-sizing plays an important role in achieving desirable circuit performance. Recently, many wire-sizing algorithms have been reported in the literature <ref> [1, 2, 4, 5, 7] </ref>. All these algorithms size each wire segment uniformly, i.e., identical width at every position on the wire. In order to achieve non-uniform wire-sizing, existing algorithms have to chop wire segments into large number of small segments.

Recently, <ref> [2] </ref> presents a wire-sizing algorithm GWSA-C for sizing the wire segments in routing trees to minimize weighted delay. Each segment in the tree is sized uniformly, i.e. uniform wire width per segment. Basically, GWSA-C is an iterative algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a global optimal solution.

Reference-contexts: We discuss in Section 4 the importance of our wire-sizing formula in sizing the wire segments in a routing tree. Finally, we present some experimental results and concluding remarks in Section 5. 2 Elmore Delay Model We use the Elmore delay model <ref> [3] </ref>. Suppose W is partitioned into n equal-length wire segments, each of length 4x = L n . Let x i be i4x, 1 i n.

Reference-contexts: When the wire is chopped into 1000 segments, it can be shown that the corresponding curve and the non-uniform wire-size curve are almost identical. Finally, we note that the authors in <ref> [8] </ref> independently solved the unconstrained wiring-sizing problem using a different approach.

Reference-contexts: Thus g (z) has a unique root b &gt; 0. We can use Newton Raphson method <ref> [9] </ref> to determine b and, in practice, five to seven iterations are sufficient. Since a = r 0 R d b and b &gt; 0, we have a &gt; 0. Figure 4 shows the exponentially decreasing nature of the optimal wire-sizing function. 3.2 Constrained Wire-Sizing We now consider constrained wire-sizing.
