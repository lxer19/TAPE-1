Abstract: We propose a computational framework for assessing uncertainty of structure estimates under perspective projection for a given camera configuration. Unlike probabilistic models, the approach takes into account finite sensor areas and relates the uncertainty in estimating a set of points to the volumes formed by the intersections of their associated frustums. Simulations demonstrate and compare the effectiveness of lateral and semicircular motion for structure recovery of arbitrarily-shaped objects.

Reference-contexts: Image sequences are typically obtained either by a set of cameras fixed in various positions in the scene or by a single camcorder moving along some trajectory. Once the relative orientation is known among the given frames, scene structure may be computed using a variety of correspondence-based techniques <ref> [2, 1] </ref>. For a sensing device with infinite resolution, structure recovery results in the same accuracy independent of camera motion, as long as the motion and correspondences are known exactly. <p> Candidate points are determined by intersecting the current plane with every other plane; details may be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 4. RESULTS FOR 2-D MOTIONS The algorithm presented in the previous section computes the uncertainty volume for a specific point with respect to a set of cameras. <p> Starting from several different initial conditions leads to solutions that are very similar but not exactly the same. One reason is that the cost function is a shallow surface and minimization over such a surface has convergence problems. Details on this and other optimization experiments may be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 7. CONCLUSIONS The paper has focused on a computational framework by which to assess the accuracy of structure estimation from known camera motion and correspondences taking into account finite sensor size.
