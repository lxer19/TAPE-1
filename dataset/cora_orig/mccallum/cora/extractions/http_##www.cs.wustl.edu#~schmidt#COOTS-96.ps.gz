Abstract: This will appear in the November/December Computing Systems Journal, USENIX, Vol. 9, No. 3., An earlier version of this paper appeared in the USENIX COOTS conference, Toronto, Canada, June 1996. Abstract This paper describes the design and performance of an object-oriented communication framework being developed by the Health Imaging division of Eastman Kodak and the Electronic Radiology Laboratory at Washington University School of Medicine. The framework is designed to meet the demands of next-generation electronic medical imaging systems, which must transfer extremely large quantities of data efficiently and flexibly in a distributed environment. A novel aspect of this framework is its seamless integration of flexible high-level CORBA distributed object computing mid-dleware with efficient low-level socket network programming mechanisms. In the paper, we outline the design goals and software architecture of our framework, describe how we resolved design challenges, and illustrate the performance of the framework over high-speed ATM networks.
