Title: The Schema Theorem and Price's Theorem  
Author: Lee Altenberg 
Address: Durham, NC, USA 27708-0251  
Affiliation: Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences Duke University,  
Abstract: Holland's Schema Theorem is widely taken to be the foundation for explanations of the power of genetic algorithms (GAs). Yet some dissent has been expressed as to its implications. Here, dissenting arguments are reviewed and elaborated upon, explaining why the Schema Theorem has no implications for how well a GA is performing. Interpretations of the Schema Theorem have implicitly assumed that a correlation exists between parent and offspring fitnesses, and this assumption is made explicit in results based on Price's Covariance and Selection Theorem. Schemata do not play a part in the performance theorems derived for representations and operators in general. However, schemata re-emerge when recombination operators are used. Using Geiringer's recombination distribution representation of recombination operators, a "missing" schema theorem is derived which makes explicit the intuition for when a GA should perform well. Finally, the method of "adaptive landscape" analysis is examined and counterexamples offered to the commonly used correlation statistic. Instead, an alternative statistic | the transmission function in the fitness domain | is proposed as the optimal statistic for estimating GA performance from limited samples.

Reference-contexts: Often with genetic algorithms, the genetic operator is applied to only a proportion, ff, of the population. In this case one would have: T (x y; z) = (1 ff)[ffi (x; y) + ffi (x; z)]=2 + ff r2f0;1g L Examples. Uniform crossover <ref> (Ackley 1987, Syswerda 1989) </ref>, i.e. free recombination (Charlesworth et al. 1992, Goodnight 1988), is described by R (r) = 2 L .

Reference-contexts: This change in the genetic operator produces evolutionary dynamics identical to that produced by the change in the representation. This exemplifies the duality between representations and operators <ref> (Altenberg 1994) </ref>. Rather than trying to push the landscape metaphor further, it may be more fruitful to return to the roots of the concept, which is the existence of multiple attractors in evolutionary dynamics (or metastable states, in the case of stochastic evolutionary systems). <p> The canonical recursion in the fitness domain (2) is then written: p (w) 0 = (1 ff) p (w) w=w + ff 0 uv where the transmission function P (w u; v) represents the action of the genetic operator and is referred to as the search kernel <ref> (Altenberg 1994) </ref>. Therefore, the values of ff and P (w u; v) contain all the information about the landscape that affects performance. The statistic op is always taken with respect to the search kernel P (w u; v).

Reference-contexts: So conditions that produce growth in the frequencies of different schemata are independent of conditions that produce growth in the upper tails of the fitness distribution. For example, consider a fitness function with a random distribution being the one-sided stable distribution of index 1/2 <ref> (Feller, 1971) </ref>: R (w) = 2N (a= p w) 1, where N (y) is the Normal distribution and a is a scale parameter. This distribution is a way of generating "needles in the haystack" on all length scales.

Reference-contexts: However, under recombination operators, schemata reappear in the formula for the change in the fitness distribution. This "missing" schema theorem shows explicitly that there must be correlations between schema fitnesses and offspring fitness distributions for good GA performance. It gives a quantitative expression to the Building Blocks Hypothesis <ref> (Goldberg 1989) </ref> and suggests ways to modify recombination operators to improve genetic algorithm performance. 2 GENETIC ALGORITHM ANALYSIS USING PRICE'S THEOREM The strategy I take here (see Altenberg (1994) for details) is to start with a general formulation of the "canonical" genetic algorithm dynamics, for arbitrary representations, operators, and fitness functions.

Reference-contexts: Price's theorem has been applied in a number of different contexts in evolutionary genetics, including kin selection (Grafen 1985, Taylor 1988), group selection (Wade 1985), the evolution of mating systems <ref> (Uyenoyama 1988) </ref>, and quantitative genetics (Frank and Slatkin 1990). Price's theorem gives the one-generation change in the population mean value of F : Theorem 1 (Covariance and Selection, Price, 1970) For any parental pair fy; zg, let (y; z) represent the expected value of F among their offspring.

Reference-contexts: fitness of the population; This general form of the transmission-selection recursion was used by Slatkin (1970), and has been used subsequently for a variety of quantitative genetic and complex transmission systems (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1976, Karlin 1979, Altenberg and Feldman 1987), and has been derived independently in genetic algorithm analysis <ref> (Vose 1990, Vose and Liepins 1991) </ref>. No assumptions are made about the structure of the chromosomes | e.g. the number of loci, the number of alleles at each locus, or even the linearity of the chromosome.

Reference-contexts: Vose (1990) and Vose and Liepins (1991) independently developed a different representation for (25) assuming two alleles at each locus, which has been called the "exact schema theorem" <ref> (Juliany and Vose 1994) </ref>.
