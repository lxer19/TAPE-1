Abstract: This work presents a new efficient method for fitting ellipses to scattered data. Previous algorithms either fitted general conics or were computationally expensive. By minimizing the algebraic distance subject to the constraint 4ac b 2 = 1 the new method incorporates the ellipticity constraint into the normalization factor. The new method combines several advantages: (i) It is ellipse-specific so that even bad data will always return an ellipse; (ii) It can be solved naturally by a generalized eigensystem and (iii) it is extremely robust, efficient and easy to implement. We compare the proposed method to other approaches and show its robustness on several examples in which other non-ellipse-specific approaches would fail or require computationally expensive iterative refinements. Source code for the algorithm is supplied and a demonstration is available on http://vision.dai.ed.ac.uk/maurizp/ ElliFitDemo/demo.html

Reference-contexts: F (a; x i ) is called the algebraic distance of a point (x; y) to the conic F (a; x) = 0.

These Hough-like techniques have some great advantages, notably high robustness to occlusion and no requirement for pre-segmentation, but they suffer from the great shortcomings of high computational complexity and non-uniqueness of solutions, which can render them unsuitable for real applications.

Reference-contexts: The appropriate constraint is well known, namely that the discriminant b 2 4ac be negative. However, this constrained problem is difficult to solve in general as the Kuhn-Tucker conditions <ref> [14] </ref> do not guarantee a solution. In fact, we have not been able to locate any reference regarding the minimization of a quadratic form subject to such a nonconvex inequality.
