Abstract: We consider the problem of indexing general database workloads (combinations of data sets and sets of potential queries). We identify two measures of efficiency of an indexing scheme for a work load: storage redundancy (how many times each item in the data set is stored), and disk access ratio (how many times more blocks than necessary does a query retrieve). We show interesting upper and lower bounds and trade-offs between them in the case of multi-dimensional range queries and set queries.
