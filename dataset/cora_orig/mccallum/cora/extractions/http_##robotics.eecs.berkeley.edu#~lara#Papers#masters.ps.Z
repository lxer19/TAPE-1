Abstract: Minimally invasive surgical techniques, in particular laparoscopy, have many advantages over traditional surgery, most notably more rapid patient recovery. Limitations of current instrumentation, however, can make laparoscopic surgery awkward for the surgeon. A teleoperative surgical workstation would improve the surgeon's dexterity and control during laparoscopy. This report first presents a brief background on laparoscopy, describes a proposed telesurgi-cal workstation, and discusses design goals for the human interface, or dextrous master, for this workstation. It then describes a prototype glove-like master and presents preliminary performance and calibration data obtained with this device.

Reference-contexts: The main advantage to the minimally invasive nature of the surgery is more rapid patient recovery ([13], pp. 1-3; [24], pp. 239-240; <ref> [5] </ref>, p. 1); for example, using laparoscopic techniques for cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal) reduces the hospital stay by 2-4 days, and the patient can return to work within a week ([13], p. 2).

Reference-contexts: The master must be comfortable, lightweight, and easy to use so the surgeon will not become fatigued ([18]; <ref> [7] </ref>). It must be easy to put on and remove, since the surgeon may need to use his or her hands in a hurry. Low cost is also important, so that hospitals will be more willing to try the new equipment.

Reference-contexts: This glove uses flexible optical fibers on the back of the glove to sense the amount of bending of the finger joints; the more the joint flexes, the less light is transmitted through the optical fiber (see <ref> [11] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: These two developments contributed to changing diagnostic laparoscopy from a non-standard technique used mainly by medical pioneers (many of whom were gynecologists) into a much more widely accepted diagnostic method ([24], Ch. 2; <ref> [13] </ref>, p. 7). Many operative laparo-scopic/pelviscopic techniques were pioneered by gynecologists as well, but only very recently (within the last five years or so) has operative laparoscopy been in common use ([24], p. 15; [13], p. 3). 2.1 Laparoscopic Procedure There are several steps that all laparoscopic operations have in common. <p> (many of whom were gynecologists) into a much more widely accepted diagnostic method ([24], Ch. 2; <ref> [13] </ref>, p. 7).

Stereo endoscopes are currently being developed to address this problem. There are other disadvantages associated with the viewing system, including reduced angle of view, reduced resolution, and the lack of ability to scan a view by moving one's head ([28]; [13], p. 39, p. 85). There are also quite a few problems associated with the mechanical aspects of laparoscopy. Since the instruments pivot about a fulcrum in the patient's abdominal wall, the instrument moves left when the surgeon moves the han dle right, and forward when he moves it back. <p> This type of control does not exhibit stimulus-response compatibility, a natural correspondence between the movements of the operator and the movements of the tool; it is not very intuitive ([7]; <ref> [13] </ref>, pp. 83-85). Also, the single access point to the abdomen makes it impossible for instruments to reach all positions and orientations; the instruments have only four degrees of freedom in position and orientation instead of six, which makes some tasks much more difficult.

Reference-contexts: The patient can be given either local or general anesthesia, depending on the procedure to be done and the preferences of the surgeon and the patient ([13], Ch. 6; [24], pp. 37-39; <ref> [21] </ref>, p. 28). The first major step of the procedure, and one of the most critical, is establishing the pneumoperitoneum. <p> The surgeon must perform various tests both before inserting the needle and before beginning insu*ation to ensure that the needle is inserted correctly and to avoid puncturing bowel or arteries. ([13], pp. 7-10; [24], pp. 132-171; <ref> [21] </ref>, pp. 29-33.) Next, the surgeon inserts the trocar, a metal rod with a sharp (usually conical) tip, through the abdominal wall. The trocar is placed in a cannula, or trocar sleeve, and both are inserted together, usually near the umbilicus. <p> Additional cannulas may be placed in a similar manner at other locations on the abdomen for the insertion of various laparoscopic instruments.

A light source cable is attached near the eyepiece. <p> Gastrointestinal endoscopes also have narrow instrument channels in them since in a gastroendoscopic procedure there is no easy way to insert instruments except through the endoscope. ([13], pp. 14-16, Ch. 2; <ref> [21] </ref>, pp. 9-12; [24], pp. 46-55.) After the laparoscope is inserted into the body cavity, the main procedure can begin. The surgeon makes a preliminary survey of the abdominal cavity, then begins the diagnostic phase of the procedure. <p> Most of the instruments are opened and closed via tendons attached to a handle that operates like the handle of a pair of scissors.

Some common laparoscopic equipment is shown in Figure 1. 10/11mm trocar. After the operation is complete, the instruments are removed and the abdominal cavity is deflated. Closure of the puncture incisions is relatively easy; the surgeon can use either skin clips, staples, or a few stitches. ([21], p.

Reference-contexts: In order to create a more natural-feeling link between the surgeon and the la-paroscopic operation we envision a surgical workstation (cf. <ref> [23] </ref>). The surgeon will use a master device to drive a remote miniature robotic tool or hand. The robotic hand will replace current endoscopic instruments in the patient's body. The surgeon will receive visual, tactile, and force feedback from the operative environment.

Reference-contexts: Minimally invasive surgery is often an alternative to more conventional types of surgery involving large incisions, for example, laparotomy, which involves a large incision through the abdominal wall. The main advantage to the minimally invasive nature of the surgery is more rapid patient recovery ([13], pp. 1-3; <ref> [24] </ref>, pp. 239-240; [5], p. 1); for example, using laparoscopic techniques for cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal) reduces the hospital stay by 2-4 days, and the patient can return to work within a week ([13], p. 2). <p> use (<ref> [24] </ref>, p. 15; [13], p. 3). 2.1 Laparoscopic Procedure There are several steps that all laparoscopic operations have in common.

The trocar is placed in a cannula, or trocar sleeve, and both are inserted together, usually near the umbilicus. <p> The cannulas come in different sizes (typically from five to ten millimeters in diameter) for use with different sizes of scopes or instruments. Additional cannulas may be placed in a similar manner at other locations on the abdomen for the insertion of various laparoscopic instruments. ([13], pp. 11-14; <ref> [24] </ref>, pp. 144-146, p. 150; [21], p. 14, pp. 33-35.) A laparoscope is essentially a rigid tube containing lenses and optical fibers with an eyepiece at one end.

The surgeon makes a preliminary survey of the abdominal cavity, then begins the diagnostic phase of the procedure. <p> The diagnostic phase includes a thorough examination of the area of suspected pathology, possibly including biopsies. Typical procedures performed in the operative phase include cholecystectomy, appendectomy, peptic ulcer surgery, adhesiolysis, tubal sterilization, puncture and excision of ovarian cysts, and many others ([13]; <ref> [24] </ref>). There are many instruments available for use in laparoscopic operations, including biopsy forceps, various types of graspers, scissors, tools for electrocautery, needleholders, and special suture loops for ligation. <p> Most of the instruments are opened and closed via tendons attached to a handle that operates like the handle of a pair of scissors. (There are other instruments specific to gastrointestinal endoscopy, such as polyp snares.) ([13], pp. 19-28; <ref> [24] </ref>, pp. 106-123; [21], pp. 9-25.)

([21], p. 39; <ref> [24] </ref>, p. 120, p. 142.) 2.2 Limitations of Laparoscopy There are several limitations of the laparoscopic instruments and imaging equipment which make laparoscopy more awkward and difficult for the surgeon than traditional surgery. <p> The lack of dexterity when operating with these instruments makes some tasks especially difficult, like suturing and tying knots within the body cavity ([13], pp. 23-25; <ref> [24] </ref>, p. 98). In addition, the instruments are single-purpose, so in order to change from grasping to cutting, for example, the surgeon must switch from one instrument to another. <p> When complications occur, or even if upon examination of the abdominal cavity the surgeon decides the planned procedure cannot easily be performed laparoscopically, the operating team must switch to performing a standard laparotomy ([13], p. 79; <ref> [24] </ref>, pp. 16-17, pp. 225-227). 3 Telesurgery Teleoperation simply means remote operation. Since during a laparoscopic procedure the surgeon operates through the medium of the endoscopic instruments and observes the operation through the medium of the video equipment, laparoscopic procedures are essentially teleoperative. <p> suturing and knot-tying inside the body cavity are particularly difficult with current endoscopic instruments, and there are times when suturing is preferable to using absorbable clips or electrocautery, such as when closing large wounds after the removal of an ovarian cyst, a tubal pregnancy, or an appendix ([13], p. 23; <ref> [24] </ref>, p. 113).

Reference-contexts: First, the view of the operative field through the scope is only two-dimensional, so the surgeon loses depth perception, making control of movements perpendicular to the viewing frame more difficult ([13], p. 39; <ref> [28] </ref>). Stereo endoscopes are currently being developed to address this problem. There are other disadvantages associated with the viewing system, including reduced angle of view, reduced resolution, and the lack of ability to scan a view by moving one's head ([28]; [13], p. 39, p. 85).
