Abstract: Wirelength estimation in VLSI layout is fundamental to any pre-detailed routing estimate of timing or routability. In this paper, we develop new wirelength estimation techniques appropriate for top-down floor-planning and placement synthesis of row-based VLSI layouts. Our methods include accurate, linear-time approaches, often with sublinear time complexity for dynamic updating of estimates (e.g., for annealing placement). The new techniques offer advantages not only for early on-line wirelength estimation during top-down placement, but also for a posteriori estimation of routed wirelength given a final placement. In developing these new estimators, we have made several theoretical contributions. Notably, we have resolved the long-standing discrepancy between region-based and bounding box-based RSMT estimation techniques; this leads to new estimates that are functions of instance size n and aspect ratio AR.

Reference-contexts: We now review the most relevant literature for this problem. Growth rates of subadditive functionals in the Euclidean plane. The work of [17] [15], in a literature that stems from the seminal work of Beardwood et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, shows that the expected cost (total tree length) of a Euclidean Steiner minimal tree over n uniformly random points chosen within a bounded plane region R of area w R h R is proportional to w R h R n for sufficiently large n. <p> that we use as the basis of new estimators in later sections. 2.1 Exact Solution of the Expected Minimum Prob lem We work with a random point P i on a segment in terms of its cumulative distribution function p i (t) : [a i ; b i ] ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, which gives the probability of the point appearing to the left of t. Thus, 1 p i (t) gives the proba bility of the point appearing to the right of t. The uniform distribution corresponds to the cumulative distribution p i (t) = ta i . <p> Fact 4 The expected minimum for k independent random points uni formly distributed on the segment <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is 1 k+1 . Example. If two points are uniformly distributed on [0; 1] the leftmost is expected at 1 3 and the rightmost at 2 3 . <p> Fact 4 The expected minimum for k independent random points uni formly distributed on the segment <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is 1 k+1 . Example. If two points are uniformly distributed on [0; 1] the leftmost is expected at 1 3 and the rightmost at 2 3 . <p> However, when the step is applied many times, additional error is incurred by our removing higher momenta of the expected minimum. To show that the sorting step (Step 1) in the Expected Minimum Heuristic improves accuracy, consider segments [a 1 ; b 1 ] = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and [a i ; b i ] = [ 1 2 ], i = 2; : : : ; n. <p> We leave determining the exact performance ratio as an open problem. 3 Expected RSMT Cost for n Random Points Distributed in a Plane Region A literature on growth rates of subadditive functionals of pointsets, originating with Beardwood et al. <ref> [1] </ref> and continuing through works of Steele and Snyder [16] [17], establishes bounds on the expected RSMT cost, E [c (RSMT )], for n points chosen uniformly at random in a region R. Specifically, we know that E [c (RSMT )] p area (R) n when n grows sufficiently large. <p> Theorem 3.1 E [c (RSMT )] for n random points chosen uniformly in a rectangular region R is proportional to the aspect ratio w (R) h (R) , when the aspect ratio is sufficiently large. Our theorem implies that we can reformulate the result from <ref> [1] </ref> as: E [c (RSMT )] p area (R) n for a sufficiently large number n &gt; N 0 of random points chosen uniformly in a region R, where N 0 depends on the shape of the region R. <p> We first generate N = 10000 random instances of n points, for n = 4; 5; : : : ; 30 (note that n = 2; 3 are not interesting), chosen from a uniform distribution in the rectangular region <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; AR], for values of aspect ratio AR = 1; 2; 4; 8; :::; 512.

Reference-contexts: Nets are expanded into cliques, and 2-neighborhoods of each are analyzed to obtain parameters of branching within the circuit. Multi-pin net wirelength estimates are inferred from these parameters and a physical model in which neighbors of a given cell compete for locations close to that cell. Cheng <ref> [2] </ref> empirically estimates the probability of having a wire pass through any given point within a net bounding box when the net is routed. <p> His methodology is equivalent to estimating the horizontal and vertical components of the RSMT cost, as a correction factor to the sum (w bb + h bb ). The correction factor is a function of the net size n; <ref> [2] </ref> provides a table of such correction factors obtained by Monte Carlo methods. 5 Our Contributions In this paper, we develop new on-line wirelength estimation techniques appropriate for top-down floorplanning and placement synthesis of row-based VLSI layouts. <p> We also make the following practical contributions. * We show that our new estimators are substantially more accurate than previous methods that are used in industry tools, including bounding box methods and the method of Cheng <ref> [2] </ref>. * We validate our new wirelength estimators in the on-line context, using a top-down partitioning-based placement tool. We show that our new estimators can stably and accurately predict eventual total RSMT cost or total bounding box half-perimeter early in the top-down placement process. <p> Table 5 shows the average values for this ratio of RSMT cost to bounding box half-perimeter, as a function of n and AR. A similar empirical analysis was performed by Cheng <ref> [2] </ref>, but the corresponding coefficients did not depend on aspect ratio. Additionally, the author of [2] used a worse code for finding heuristic RSMTs. As a result, the entries of the first row of Table 5, which we reproduce from [2], are larger than our entries by approximately 2% even in <p> Table 5 shows the average values for this ratio of RSMT cost to bounding box half-perimeter, as a function of n and AR.

Reference-contexts: The constant of proportionality, denoted by b, is dependent on the functional of the pointset (e.g., the minimum spanning tree cost, or the minimum traveling salesperson tour cost, have similar growth rates but different constants of proportionality b EMST , b ET SP , etc.). MST-based methods. Hwang <ref> [10] </ref> shows that the rectilinear Steiner ratio (worst-case ratio of rectilinear minimum spanning tree (RMST) cost to RSMT cost) is 3=2. Hence, 2=3 times the RMST cost is a lower bound on RSMT cost.
