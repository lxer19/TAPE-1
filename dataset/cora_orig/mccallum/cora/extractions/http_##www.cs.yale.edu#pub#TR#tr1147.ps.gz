Reference-contexts: in the fact that the equivalent semidefinite programming problem can be solved, for any desired accuracy *, in time polynomial in O (n p * , where L is an upper bound on the size of the optimal solution, using a variant of the Interior Point method proposed by Alizadeh <ref> [1] </ref>. In section 3.5, we embed this procedure in our own algorithm for finding the largest isomorphic subtrees corresponding to two shock graphs.

Reference-contexts: Finally, Fran~cois and Medioni have proposed a connection hierarchy of parts for planar shape recognition [14], obtained from an axial decomposition introduced in [42]. Among the many applications of curve evolution to problems in computer vision and image processing, e.g., see <ref> [2, 45, 30] </ref>, only a handful have addressed the problem of shape representation. Tari et. al have proposed a linear diffusion equation which can be used to build skeletal descriptions directly from greyscale images [52], and is computationally more efficient than those based on standard level set methods [36].

Reference-contexts: Thus certain discrete events are required to separate equivalence classes of continuous ones, and in mathematics such discrete events derive from singularity theory <ref> [3] </ref>. Kimia, Tannenbaum, and Zucker [23] 5 applied singularity theory to shape by exploring the consequences of slight boundary defor-mations. <p> It should be clear that there is a relationship between the above coloring and the velocity function dR dx along the medial axis [48]. In separate work, we are investigating the Morse function properties of the signed distance function, and the Arnold classification of singular-ities <ref> [3] </ref>. In Figure 7 we provide numerical examples of colored medial axis descriptions.

Reference-contexts: Pauwels et al. have proposed the use of semi-differential invariants for planar shape recognition under affine distortions, with some robustness to occlusion [33, 38]. Basri et al. have proposed various models for measuring the cost of deforming one contour into another, while taking into account its part structure <ref> [4] </ref>. Gdalyahu and Weinshall have also proposed metric functions for measuring the similarity between two closed planar curves [18]. However, the previous three methods do not explicitly account for a shape's interior, which is key for determining more global properties such as symmetry.

Reference-contexts: Image curves are also at the heart of boundary-based descriptions, such as those of Hoff-man and Richards [41], and alignment techniques, such as the one proposed by Ullman <ref> [5] </ref>. However, the Hoffman and Richards "codon" vocabulary is only an intermediate step toward more abstract part descriptions, and remains to be completed. It is an attempt to restrict the graph representation to the boundary, which eliminates contours that span several objects.

Reference-contexts: In important contrast to the boundary based techniques discussed earlier was Blum's <ref> [6] </ref> medial axis transform|or skeleton|which preceded Rosch by about a decade. Blum's skeleton is area-based, and provides a description of shapes via the loci of centers of covering balls. <p> This construction is inspired by Blum's classic work on axis-morphologies, in which he explored the use of directed graphs based on the medial axis for defining equivalence classes of objects <ref> [6] </ref>. The shock types will label each vertex in the graph and the shock formation times will direct edges to provide an ordering for matching, and a basis for subgraph approximation. <p> An exhaustive enumeration of these local configurations remains tractable, since we have a small number of vertex types. A similar tabulation was first provided (though without proof) by Blum <ref> [6, p. 257] </ref>, and related results were also derived in [49]. Recall that the SG is rooted at a unique vertex labeled # and has one or more terminal vertices labeled .

Reference-contexts: The constant ff 0 controls the regularizing effects of curvature . When ff is large, the equation becomes a geometric heat equation; when ff = 0, the equation is equivalent to Blum's grassfire transformation <ref> [7, 23] </ref>. In this paper, we shall only be interested in the latter case, under which the evolution equation is hyperbolic and shocks [27], or entropy-satisfying singularities can form.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, no acceptable solution for automatically finding edge correspondences has been offered. Considering the boundaries of objects implies a viewpoint dependency to shape recognition <ref> [8] </ref>, but does not specify which features to use for each view. Aspect graphs were introduced by Koenderink and van Doorn [25] to enumerate topologically-distinct views [26] 2 via singular or catastrophic events.

Reference-contexts: One option that is worth stressing is the use of hierarchical skeletons [35], because it attempts to capture a notion of "scale" for objects. This is important because, should such scales be available, coarse-to-fine matching strategies could be employed; see also Burbeck and Pizer <ref> [9] </ref>. In recent work, Sclaroff and Pentland have addressed the problem of 2-D shape matching 3 using a modal representation corresponding to a shape's generalized axes of symmetry [47]. This compact representation has been used for indexing [46], and offers a frequency-like (coarse to fine) decomposition of a shape.

Reference-contexts: The techniques are typically difficult to extend to natural objects. Computer vision approaches to view-based modeling fall broadly into two classes. First, there are feature-based methods which represent each view as a collection of line segments, curves, corners, regions, etc. <ref> [22, 10, 11, 39] </ref>. The success of such methods depends largely on the extent to which the features are present and can be reliably extracted; once again they are not easily applied to natural objects.

Reference-contexts: The above minimization problem is known to be NP-hard for general graphs [17], however, polynomial time algorithms exist for the special case of finite rooted trees. Matula and Edmonds <ref> [12] </ref> describe once such technique, involving the solution of 2n 1 n 2 network flow problems, where n 1 and n 2 represent the number of vertices in the two graphs.

Reference-contexts: For example, when a cup is rotated, there is a par-ticular viewpoint from which the handle just becomes visible; thereafter, only geometric variations take place until, at another singular viewpoint, the handle disappears. However, aspect graphs and other methods based on algebraic and differential invariants <ref> [13] </ref> were successfully defined only for specific classes of algebraic surfaces that fit only few (man-made) objects. The techniques are typically difficult to extend to natural objects. Computer vision approaches to view-based modeling fall broadly into two classes.

Reference-contexts: This motivating example is at the heart of this paper: we seek a technique for object recognition based on such entry-level, generic descriptions. 1 1.1 Classical Aspects of Shape Recognition Rosch's experimental observation that basic-level descriptions precede particulars was made about the same time that Fu <ref> [15] </ref> and others were introducing syntactic pattern recognition. Fu's goal was to define a grammar for patterns, and then to specify automata that could recognize this grammar. However, this program lost favor because there was no clear indication of those pattern features on which the grammar should be based.

Reference-contexts: Next, we form a bipartite edge weighted graph G (V 1 ; V 2 ; E G ) with edge weights from the matrix (G; H). 6 Using the scaling algorithm of Goemans, Gabow, and Williamson <ref> [16] </ref>, we then find the maximum cardinality, minimum weight matching in G. This results in a list of node correspondences between G and H, called M 1 , that can be ranked in decreasing order of similarity. <p> of H at v compute jV G u j fi jV H v j weight matrix (G u ; H v ) 19 M max cardinality, minimum weight bipartite matching in G (V G u ; V H v ) with weights from (G u ; H v ) (see <ref> [16] </ref>) (u 0 ; v 0 ) minimum weight pair in M (G; H) (G; H) [ f (u 0 ; v 0 )g call match (u 0 ,v 0 ) G u G u fxjx 2 V G u and (x; w) 2 (G; H)g H v H v fyjy <p> Once a vertex is mapped, it will never participate in another mapping again.

Moreover, the construction of the (v) vectors will take O (n p nL) time, implying that the overall complexity of the algorithm is max (O (n 2 p nL).

Further, since our shock graphs are labeled graphs, consistency between node labels must be enforced in the isomorphism.

Reference-contexts: The complexity was further reduced by Reyner [40] to O (n 1:5 1 n 2 ) (assuming n 1 n2), through a reduction to the bipartite matching algorithm of Hopcraft and Karp <ref> [21] </ref>. If we could transform our directed acyclic shock graphs to finite rooted trees, we could pursue a polynomial time solution to our problem. In the following subsections we show that for any shock graph, there exists a unique rooted tree.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the SG is a directed acyclic graph. This has important consequences for object matching because the problem of searching directed acyclic graphs is computationally much simpler than that of searching arbitrary graphs <ref> [24] </ref>. Second, since there exist rules in the SGG whose left-hand sides do not consist of single nonterminals, the SGG is not context-free. <p> More formally, we seek the matrix M , the global optimizer of the following <ref> [24, 32] </ref>: min 2 u2V 1 v2V 2 s:t: u 0 2V 2 X M (v; v 0 ) 1; 8v 0 2 V 2 (2) where jj:jj is a measure of the similarity between the labels of corresponding nodes in the two shock graphs (see Section 3.4).

Reference-contexts: This structure is highly constrained because the events that govern the birth, combination, and death of shock groups can be abstracted into a small number of rewrite rules, shown in Figure 2. In analogy to Leyton's Process Grammar <ref> [29] </ref>, the rules have been grouped according to the semantic processes that they characterize, although the alphabet of shock types that they operate on is quite different from boundary-based codons.

Reference-contexts: Proper skeletons can be found interactively, but not automatically, and as with the Fu and the Ullman approaches, the features have to be edited to provide a basis for matching. One option that is worth stressing is the use of hierarchical skeletons <ref> [35] </ref>, because it attempts to capture a notion of "scale" for objects. This is important because, should such scales be available, coarse-to-fine matching strategies could be employed; see also Burbeck and Pizer [9].

Reference-contexts: The techniques are typically difficult to extend to natural objects. Computer vision approaches to view-based modeling fall broadly into two classes. First, there are feature-based methods which represent each view as a collection of line segments, curves, corners, regions, etc. <ref> [22, 10, 11, 39] </ref>. The success of such methods depends largely on the extent to which the features are present and can be reliably extracted; once again they are not easily applied to natural objects.

Reference-contexts: Matula and Edmonds [12] describe once such technique, involving the solution of 2n 1 n 2 network flow problems, where n 1 and n 2 represent the number of vertices in the two graphs. The complexity was further reduced by Reyner <ref> [40] </ref> to O (n 1:5 1 n 2 ) (assuming n 1 n2), through a reduction to the bipartite matching algorithm of Hopcraft and Karp [21]. If we could transform our directed acyclic shock graphs to finite rooted trees, we could pursue a polynomial time solution to our problem. <p> of an adjacency matrix corresponding to a shock tree leads to a property that is invariant to any consistent permutation or reordering of its subtrees (submatrices). 3 After defining a suitable measure of shock distance between corresponding nodes in two shock trees, we present a novel modification to Reyner's algorithm <ref> [40] </ref> which combines coarse topological matching with shock distance to solve our largest isomorphic subgraph problem in polynomial time. 3.2 Shock Graphs to Shock Trees In this section we present a reduction that takes a DAG representing a shock graph to a unique vertex labeled rooted tree whose size is polynomially <p> b S and S 0 , (( b S); (S 0 )) can be computed in time O (pq). 3.5 Algorithm for Matching Two Shock Trees Our recursive algorithm for matching the rooted subtrees G and H corresponding to two shock graphs is inspired by the algorithm proposed by Reyner <ref> [40] </ref>. The algorithm recursively finds matches between vertices, starting at the root of the shock tree, and proceeding down through the subtrees in a depth-first fashion.

Reference-contexts: Probability measures have also been placed on images and image curves in an attempt to provide a priori information suitable to guide matching [20]. Image curves are also at the heart of boundary-based descriptions, such as those of Hoff-man and Richards <ref> [41] </ref>, and alignment techniques, such as the one proposed by Ullman [5]. However, the Hoffman and Richards "codon" vocabulary is only an intermediate step toward more abstract part descriptions, and remains to be completed.

Reference-contexts: Bounding and interior image curves were typical, but the graph matching rapidly became intractable. Missing and bogus edges were a problem, and the complexity of curve possibilities exceeded the grammars. With the exception of array grammars <ref> [44] </ref>, little progress was made. Research continues on graph isomorphism algorithms for vision applications, but examples are still typically based on graphs derived from feature points and image curves [19].

Reference-contexts: It should be clear that there is a relationship between the above coloring and the velocity function dR dx along the medial axis <ref> [48] </ref>. In separate work, we are investigating the Morse function properties of the signed distance function, and the Arnold classification of singular-ities [3]. In Figure 7 we provide numerical examples of colored medial axis descriptions. <p> Hence the medial axis M e (X), which is strictly contained in the skeleton S (X) <ref> [48, pp. 382-383] </ref>, is also unique. (In fact the two sets are very close since M e (X) = S (X)[31].) The coloring of medial axis points into four types in Section 1 is unique, which implies that a unique set of vertices exists for the corresponding SG. <p> Finally, by Definition 2, the direction of an edge between two abutting vertices is ambiguous only when t i = t j for all shocks in i and j. Due to the continuity of the radius function along the skeleton <ref> [48, pp. 381-382] </ref>, the only possibility is that the two vertices share the point where they touch, in which case we have the contradiction that all shocks in i and j would lie in the same ~ 3, and hence in a single vertex. <p> All other vertices are shock groups taken from the set V nf#; g = f ~ 1; 2; ~ 3; 4g. It follows from the "coloring" in Section 1 and the continuity of the radius function along the skeleton <ref> [48, pp. 381-382] </ref> that no 2, ~ 3, or 4 can "touch" a distinct 2, ~ 3 or 4. Therefore, Observation 1 No 2, ~ 3 or 4 can have a 2, ~ 3 or 4 as a parent or as a child.

Reference-contexts: Hence, a 2-shock and a 4-shock are each semantically equivalent to a ~ 3 in a specific context. The SG's for a variety of shapes are shown in Figure 8. All the graphs were generated automatically from the output of the shock detection process <ref> [49] </ref> displayed in Figure 7. Following the third observation, only label types ~ 1 and ~ 3 have been explicitly assigned. <p> Each shock in a segment is further labeled by its position, its time of formation (radius of the skeleton), and its direction of flow (or orientation in the case of ~ 3's), all obtained from the shock detection algorithm <ref> [49] </ref>. In order to measure the similarity between two vertices u and v, we interpolate a low dimensional curve through their respective shock trajectories, and assign a cost C (u; v) to an affine transformation that aligns one interpolated curve with the other. <p> We supplemented the tool shapes with silhouettes of 8 biological shapes, Figure 6. The shock-based descriptions of representative shapes, numerically computed using the algorithms developed in <ref> [49] </ref>, are shown in Figure 7, with the derived shock graphs in Figure 8. Note that apart from a "smallest scale" regularization induced by the sampling grid, the procedure for shock detection is automatic [49]. <p> The shock-based descriptions of representative shapes, numerically computed using the algorithms developed in <ref> [49] </ref>, are shown in Figure 7, with the derived shock graphs in Figure 8. Note that apart from a "smallest scale" regularization induced by the sampling grid, the procedure for shock detection is automatic [49]. Notice how for each shape a hierarchy of components emerges, with the most significant components (e.g., the palm of the hand, and the neck of the pliers) placed closest to the root node. Similar descriptions were computed for each of the shapes in the database. <p> An exhaustive enumeration of these local configurations remains tractable, since we have a small number of vertex types. A similar tabulation was first provided (though without proof) by Blum [6, p. 257], and related results were also derived in <ref> [49] </ref>. Recall that the SG is rooted at a unique vertex labeled # and has one or more terminal vertices labeled . All other vertices are shock groups taken from the set V nf#; g = f ~ 1; 2; ~ 3; 4g.

Reference-contexts: From the resulting shock subtrees, we repeat the process of finding the best corresponding subtrees. In step 5, the subtree pair (1-006,1-004) is selected and added to the final correspondences in step 6. 22 silhouettes were segmented automatically using the active contour developed in <ref> [50] </ref>. * Steps 7-12 After removing the subgraphs originating at (1-006,1-004), a new pair (3-002,3-001) is selected in step 7, and added to the final correspondences in step 8. <p> The binary silhouettes were extracted automatically using the active contour developed in <ref> [50] </ref>, as shown in Figure 5 (bottom). Observe that due to shadows and highlights, there may be slight discrepancies between the segmented outlines and the "true" ones; our matching algorithm is designed to robustly handle such discrepancies. We supplemented the tool shapes with silhouettes of 8 biological shapes, Figure 6.

In effect, this implies that edges are significant if and only if they appear in all views of an object which, of course, is impossible to achieve in general.
