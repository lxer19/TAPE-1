Abstract: Vinyas is a digital type font design environment for the design of calligraphic style typefaces. It has been designed primarily for creating new fonts rather than enabling the transfer of existing fonts from paper to machine. Within this environment a comprehensive set of interactive tools are available to the type font designer for typeface design. Vinyas is based on a powerful font design methodology, viz, the pen stroke method of specifying shapes. With minimal interaction, the designer can describe his forms, edit them, visualise them singly or in combination, and then create a full dictionary of letterforms for use. Unlike many other systems based on this methodology which produce the final output as bitmaps, Vinyas generates scalable analytic descriptions that are downloadable to a Postscript T M laser printer or typesetter. This paper describes the design of the Vinyas system and certain novel aspects of its user interface. The paper also describes the design process and the feature abstraction mechanisms provided to a calligrapher for digital typefont design.

Reference-contexts: TYPE DESIGN SYSTEMS A very good survey of the reported type design systems in use is provided in <ref> [1] </ref>. A high-level categorisation of type design systems is shown in Figure 1. On the top level we have bitmap based and geometry based systems. The bitmap based systems are for type design for screen and low resolution printers such as dot matrix printers or ink jet printers.

Reference-contexts: Metafont <ref> [2] </ref> is a pen stroke based system. It models the shape of the strokes. Metafont provides excellent mathematical tools for shape descriptions and specifying relationships between shapes. A Metafont user writes a program for each glyph design; hence the user community has to be composed of reasonably skilled programmers.

Reference-contexts: Various systems have been reported [3,4,5,6,7], which attempt to model the texture of the strokes as well. Most of the systems are interpreter based, that is, not only are they not interactive, they also require a programmer to interact with the designer to write these programs. In <ref> [5] </ref> we find the description of an interactive system with the pen constrained to be a piece of charcoal with a fixed shape. Also, the charcoal needs to be redefined for different platforms depending on the resolution of the display.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, it could produce interesting never-done-before typefaces. With the new printing technology, the reader of printed pages may as well expect some pleasant surprises ! 3. ABOUT VINYAS Vinyas is an interactive WYSIWYG pen stroke based font design system for a user community consisting of artists and calligraphers <ref> [8] </ref>. Vinyas assumes that this community is computer literate to the extent of being able to operate a computer through keyboard/mouse. The design presented on the screen is a faithful representation of the image that will be produced on a hard copy device.

Reference-contexts: Other aids such as multiple shades and splitting can be applied to the pens and the new manifestation of these strokes can be seen (Figure 7). 4.4. Font Format Vinyas generates scalable analytic fonts in Adobe's Type 3 format <ref> [11] </ref>. Handtuned bitmap fonts at different sizes are produced in Adobe's Bitmap Distribution Format. Thus fonts designed using Vinyas can be directly incorporated in systems accepting these font Proc. of the International Conference on Computer Graphics (ICCG 93),pp. 355-368, 1993. formats. We are currently working on providing hinting 5 [12].

In this context we are investigating the possibility of exploiting the underlying pen-stroke model of the strokes to arrive at hints that can be directly specified by the designer. 5. HIGH RESOLUTION LOCATOR INPUT The designer, defines the grids 6 as a part of the environment setting.

Reference-contexts: Zooming in Vinyas The software cursor on the screen denotes the current region of interest. To obtain higher resolution, the grid cell addressed by the cursor is subdivided into four quadrants in a quad-tree fashion <ref> [13] </ref> (See Figure 9). Standard neighbour finding techniques are used to interpret the use of cursor movement keys. Similarly, for snapping the mouse position to the hierarchic grid, standard quad-tree search techniques are used. <p> Vinyas provides a default grid specification for a beginner. Proc. of the International Conference on Computer Graphics (ICCG 93),pp. 355-368, 1993. Internally, cell subdivision is represented by a quad-tree and points in the tree are represented precisely using a linear encoding scheme <ref> [13] </ref>. Thus, all definition points, whatever the resolution, have a discrete (virtual space) representation. This enables one to perform an exact point equality operation and also gives a meaningful mapping to different physical grids.
