Reference-contexts: Functions We now review the method for computing Haar coefficients: we restrict our attention to a sequence of eight samples x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x 8 (which can be thought of as averages on intervals of length 1 8 of a function defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, each of them is orthogonal to all of its integer translates and dyadic rescaled versions. The full collection of these wavelet packets (including translates and rescaled versions) provides us with a library of "templates" or "notes" which are matched "efficiently" to signals for analysis and synthesis (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>), Wavelet packet expansions correspond algorithmically to subband coding schemes and are numerically as fast as the FFT. A.2 Entropy considerations We will now measure the distance or good fit between a basis and a function in terms of the Shannon entropy of the expansion. <p> Since all transformations were orthogonal we must have that the collection of vectors corresponding to this choice of patterns is an orthogonal basis of R 8 .

Reference-contexts: s k;j and C k;j as an even extension we find s k;j ?C k 0 ;j 0 permitting us to write C k;j iS k;j = e ij~=2 k ^ (~=2 j ) where ^ (~) = e i=2~ p (~) is the Fourier transform of the wavelet (cf. <ref> [4] </ref>). Thus, wavelet analysis corresponds to windowing frequency space in "octave" windows (2 k ; 2 k+1 ). A natural extension is provided by allowing all dyadic windows in frequency space and adapted window choice. This sort of analysis is equivalent to wavelet packet analysis. APPENDIX A.

Reference-contexts: The dual version of the window selection provides an adapted subband coding algorithm. The wavelet packet library is constructed by iterating the wavelet algorithm. This library contains the wavelet basis, Walsh functions, and smooth versions of Walsh functions called wavelet packets (cf. <ref> [5] </ref>) These waveforms are mutually orthogonal. Moreover, each of them is orthogonal to all of its integer translates and dyadic rescaled versions.
