Abstract: This paper presents an extended update functionality in temporal databases, as a vehicle for supporting simultaneous values semantics. A situation of simultaneous values of a single data item occurs when multiple values that are valid at the same time were assigned to a data item over the database history. In conventional temporal database models there is a fixed semantics to handle such a case; if the data item's type is an atom, then only one value is assigned, usually on the basis of the update time; if the data item's type allows for multiple values, then all the values persist. We show that various types of applications require support for different forms of simultaneous values semantics. The support of simultaneous values is achieved using an extended set of operation types, that consists of the conventional update operation types (insert, modify and delete) as well as additional types. The semantics of the update operation types is given, as well as the correctness of the model. The extended update functionality is part of an update model that is currently being implemented in a prototype for a simulation project in a hospital's training center. Issues related to the implementation of this functionality in various data models are

Reference-contexts: This default has been used by other researchers (e.g., <ref> [BZ82] </ref>) assuming that the value was not valid from -1. This default is a natural extension of the update logic in conventional databases, where a new value replaces an older one as of the time it is inserted to the database.

Reference-contexts: Mapping the data structure into a "flat" relational model requires the use of normalization rules. The implementation in the temporal model is not unique. A possible implementation can use universal relations as discussed in <ref> [N + 87] </ref>. Another possible implementation uses the ENF (Extension Normal Form), which is an extension of the TNF (Time Normal Form) [NA89], as follows.

Another possible implementation uses the ENF (Extension Normal Form), which is an extension of the TNF (Time Normal Form) <ref> [NA89] </ref>, as follows. Each relation designates a set of synchronous attributes, which are attributes that have common state-element's additional information (t d , t v , etc.) at any chronon.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to emulate the decision time functionality, without using an explicit time type, by adding objects that designate decisions 5 , and using the beginning of the t v interval of their variables to denote decision time. Such a solution is proposed in <ref> [OS95] </ref>, and it complies with the desire not to add more primitives. However, we argue that this requirement is general, and important enough to have a direct representation.

Reference-contexts: selection CSE and ASE can be expressed by TSQL2 queries as well. 37 4.4.2 A Proposal to Augment TSQL2 In order to support that functionality in a convenient way, the following features should be supported as a primitive level, this can be done as a shell on top of TSQL2 <ref> [S + 94] </ref>, or as direct extension to the TSQL2 language. 1. A mechanism for handling simultaneous values is required. This mechanism should include new functions and defaults to support the retrieval of simultaneous values. These functions consist of the CSE and ASE functions. 2.

Reference-contexts: A similar approach, in different contexts, was taken in other works as well (e.g., <ref> [Sno87] </ref>). For example, the operation set-var (oid=864545, p= Social-Security-Number, val=02345678, o d =nil, o v =nil), applied to the database on Dec 12, 1993; 11:30pm, results in the creation of state-element (se11) in Figure 4. Freeze-var freezes a variable.
