Title: Global Convergence of the Affine Scaling Algorithm for Convex Quadratic Programming  
Author: Renato D.C. Monteiro T. Tsuchiya 
Date: March 24, 1995  
Abstract: In this paper we give a global convergence proof of the second order affine scaling algorithm for convex quadratic programming problems, where the next iterate is the point which minimizes the objective function over the intersection of the feasible region with the ellipsoid centered at the current point and whose radius is a fixed fraction fi 2 (0; 1] of the radius of the largest "scaled" ellipsoid inscribed in the nonnegative orthant. The analysis is based on the local Karmarkar potential function introduced by Tsuchiya. For any fi 2 (0; 2=3] and without assuming any nondegeneracy assumption on the problem, it is shown that the sequences of primal iterates and dual estimates converge to optimal solutions of the quadratic program and its dual, respectively.

Reference-contexts: The last problem would be to show convergence of Algorithm AS for any value of fi 2 (0; 1]. Towards this end, a result established by Dikin <ref> [5] </ref> could be useful. For a homogeneous LP problem having 0 as the unique optimal solution, Dikin shows that each step of the affine scaling algorithm with fi = 1 reduces the value of the potential function by a fixed constant.

In this algorithm, the search direction is obtained by minimizing a first order linear approximation of the objective function at the current point over the same ellipsoid mentioned above and the next point is determined by performing a line search along this direction.

The proof of (a), (b) and (c) are given in Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 of Sun <ref> [17] </ref> under the conditions stated in Assumption 2.1. It has been proved in Vanderbei and Lagarias [25] that the matrix valued mapping U (x) j (AX 2 A T ) 1 AX 2 is bounded on P ++ whenever Assumption 2.1 (A) holds. <p> The first problem is to remove the assumption that the set of optimal solutions of (1) is bounded. The only part we use this assumption in this paper is to show the convergence of the sequence fx k g, where we use a result of Jie Sun <ref> [17] </ref>. The second problem is to establish that B S = B.

Reference-contexts: Sun [17] proves global convergence for this algorithm without imposing any nondegeneracy assumption. His analysis, which generalizes the one given in Tseng and Luo <ref> [18] </ref> for LP problems, is still restrictive in the sense that it allows only very small radius fi, i.e. fi = 2 O (L) , where L is the input size of the problem.
