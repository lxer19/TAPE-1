Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Dawkinss model of evolution is based on the gene. He presents his theory of the gene as the fundamental unit of natural selection <ref> [Dawk89] </ref>. Genetic material in complex organisms is represented using a diploid chromosome. In the diploid form a genotype carries one or more pairs of chromosomes, each containing information for the same functions.

Reference-contexts: Genes which are expressed in the phenotype of an organism are dominant and those that dont are recessive. Some genes that have been known to be dominant have become recessive in successive generations and vice versa. These dominance characteristics have evolved over generations. Genetic programming <ref> [Koza92] </ref> traditionally uses a haploid chromosome. The haploid form contains all the information relevant to the problem. The genes do not have associated dominance values. 2.
