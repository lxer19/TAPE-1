Reference-contexts: Lack of R measurements in HERA kinematic range induce large uncertainties in F 2 and dF 2 d log Q 2 compared to statistical errors in some kinematic regions when other systematic uncertainties due to detector effects are better understood <ref> [1] </ref>. Secondly, measurement of R allows for direct test of perturbative QCD and it establishes the validity of extracting quark and gluon distributions.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, measurement of R allows for direct test of perturbative QCD and it establishes the validity of extracting quark and gluon distributions. For perturbative QCD to consistently explain the ZEUS data <ref> [2, 3] </ref> it is necessary that F L (x; Q 2 ) is significantly smaller than F 2 (x; Q 2 ) because even a steeply rising gluon distributions, consistent with gluon extracted from ZEUS data [3], predict moderately small values ( 0:5) for the ratio R. <p> energy settings is done such that the total running time for the year 1996 is conserved. 2 Kinematic Reconstruction Using scattered electron energy (E) and angle (), with respect to the positive Z-axis defined in the direction of the proton beam, in reconstructing the event kinematics yields the best resolutions <ref> [2] </ref> in the high y and low Q 2 region of interest for R measurement. <p> The resolution on kinematic variable x computed from the scattered electron energy (E) and angle () is extremely non-gaussian as is to be expected. In published ZEUS F 2 analysis <ref> [2] </ref> the events were binned in x Q 2 plane. The bin sizes were chosen respecting certain conditions on the bin acceptance and purity obtained by Monte Carlo simulation of DIS events in the ZEUS detector. <p> In this study the Q 2 bin width is chosen to be as in 1993 analysis <ref> [2] </ref>. Figure 1 illustrates the binning for one particular choice of high and low beam energy settings. It is interesting to locate the scattered electrons in the detector at higher and lower beam energies. <p> This background grows rapidly with the lowering of the scattered electron energy. This background is measured using luminosity and beam pipe calorimeters, albeit poorly, due to the limited acceptance of the detectors. Extrapolation of tail of photoproduction event y distribution yields an estimate for this background. The previous analysis <ref> [2] </ref> was limited to high scattered electron energy region primarily because of the uncertainty due to this background subtraction. Therefore, it is of interest to study the photoproduction background at lower beam energy settings particularly for the case of lower electron beam energy. <p> A small bin centering correction is used to correct for slightly different center of bin x and Q 2 mean values at the two energies. The parameterizations for F 2 <ref> [2] </ref> and R [4] used to compute the differential cross section d 2 dydQ 2 are given by, F 2 (x; Q 2 ) = [1 x 2 ] 4 [0:35 + 0:0170x 0:3520:155 log 10 Q 2 R (x; Q 2 ) = 3 log 10 0:001 ] Q 2 <p> However, the effects due to electron finder efficiency are included. The choice of y Q 2 bins ensures that the bins are fully overlapped at both energies unlike the case of x Q 2 bins (1993 F 2 bins of <ref> [2] </ref>) considered in [4]. 5 Electron finder efficiency One of the needed inputs for this simple study of the statistical error on R is a parameterization of the electron finder efficiency. Of the available electron finders for ZEUS data analysis neural network based Sinistra program [8] is currently most used.

If measured R (x; Q 2 ) turns out to be large in the kinematic region accessible to HERA, the QCD description of proton structure in that region may need significant alteration.

Reference-contexts: Separation of R (x; Q 2 ) and F 2 (x; Q 2 ) requires that the differential cross section for electron-proton scattering be measured at different values of center of mass energy, p Initial feasibility study of measuring R using reduced beam energies at HERA <ref> [4] </ref> indicated that running at proton energies of E p = 820 and 500 GeV for integrated luminosities of R Ldt = 5 pb 1 for each energy will permit statistical precision of interest. <p> seen that the lower electron beam energy data has lower photoproduction background particles in the region of RCAL. 10 4 Program description In order to evaluate the precision on R for a given choice of high and low beam energy and luminosity settings, a procedure similar to that described in <ref> [4] </ref> is followed.

Reference-contexts: The effective resolution of the calorimeter deteriorates to about 26 % / p the very rear region of the detector, &gt; 160 ffi <ref> [7] </ref>. Energy loss in the inactive material is compensated by a correction based on the p t measurement in the central and rear tracking detectors (CTD and RTD), or energy measurement in the small angle rear tracking detector (SRTD). <p> SRTD energy correction is particularly important due to presence of a large amount of inactive material in front of it <ref> [7] </ref>. Good angular resolution of 1.5 mr is realized due to the tracking chambers which provide Z vertex resolution of 0.4 cm, and, due to calorimeter and SRTD which provide electron position resolution of 0.3 cm.

Reference-contexts: Of the available electron finders for ZEUS data analysis neural network based Sinistra program <ref> [8] </ref> is currently most used. This program uses only calorimeter data for finding the electron. More significantly the network has not been optimized for finding electrons below 10 GeV.

Reference-contexts: The lowering of the cutoff and increased efficiency for lower electron beam energy is justified by the availability of the additional detectors (RTD and CTD) in the angular region of interest and by the reduced photoproduction background seen at the generator level. 6 HERA Luminosity HERA luminosity <ref> [9] </ref> is expected to degrade substantially when electron or proton beam energy is reduced from the nominal values of 27.5 GeV and 820 GeV respectively.

Reference-contexts: Preliminary look at the photoproduction background seems to indicate that it is less of a problem for the lower electron beam energy case. Relative luminosity measurement, using bremsstrahlung events identified in ZEUS luminosity detector, at two proton beam energies is expected to be controlled at 1-2 percent level <ref> [10] </ref>. However, the luminosity measurement uncertainty for lower electron beam energy is not understood yet. Use of wide angle Compton scattering events for luminosity measurement has been suggested as an alternative [5].
