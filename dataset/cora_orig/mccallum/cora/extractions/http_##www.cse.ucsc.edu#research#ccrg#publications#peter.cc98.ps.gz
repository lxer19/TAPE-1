Abstract: Distributed multipoint applications for group interaction across wide-area networks, such as for simulation and telecollaboration, are becoming increasingly popular. While reliable multicasting has made significant advances in recent years, effective mechanisms to synchronize and coordinate work within large multicast groups and across long distances are still lacking. Synchronous sharing of resources, whose operational semantics prohibits parallel usage, typically creates race conditions among users, which can be resolved through an access discipline called floor control. Existing solutions on floor control, implemented either at the session or application layer, are mostly proprietary, limited in scope and not scalable. Furthermore, no performance comparison of floor control protocols has been attempted to date. We present a novel taxonomy and comparative performance analysis of known classes of floor control protocols, ranging from socially mediated control to protocols operating on ring and tree topologies. We find that aggregation and selective transmission of control information in a tree structure is the most promising solution with regard to scalability, efficacy, and robustness. The principal operation of such a tree protocol is outlined, which dynamically organizes participants in a multi-level control tree and aggregates resource sharing directives on the paths between interacting stations.

Reference-contexts: Hybrid solutions are also well-suited for network computers, where hosts have limited capabilities and communicate with each other via session servers. Floor control is often viewed as an add-on to existing session services, such as bridging in call control <ref> [3] </ref> or large-scale conference management [17]. However, session and floor control, while coexisting, are independent and floor control can be centralized, while session control is distributed, or vice versa.

Reference-contexts: Floor control deployment may involve social or cultural issues of communication among users, which are beyond the scope of this paper. On the system level, floor control can orchestrate intelligent allocation of scarce shared resources based on user input. For example, the SCUBA protocol <ref> [4] </ref> intertwines floor control with a rate-adaptation mechanism throttling media stream transmission according to the interest or capabilities of a heterogeneous receiver set. Only sources being granted the floor are allowed to consume bandwidth, and floor control directives can be used to reserve future bandwidth shares.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1. The efficacy of RSI without multicast support is RSI = (ffi + n*)e 2 (ffi+n*) (2) Proof: Figure 5 shows a prototypical RSI turn. The proof is the same as for medium access in an ALOHA channel <ref> [5] </ref>. In the point-to-point model, we assume that n stations are actively monitoring each other, and it takes an additional time n* for all stations to perceive the activity from a given station. <p> In Activity Sensing (RAS) [7,16], activities on shared resources are monitored by a background process at the session layer (without the user having to do so), in order to sense which node currently operates on the resource. The RAS concept is related to collision sensing on a multiaccess channel <ref> [5] </ref>. In principle, no changes to a collaboration-unaware application are required to integrate floor control by modifying the X-server to intercept and filter calls to the application signifying access to a shared resource. <p> Stations, active or inactive, are either directly connected to each other, or they are logically arranged in a multihop ring or tree geometry. Implicit token passing <ref> [5] </ref> is a special case used to reduce token size, in which a station relinquishing the floor simply goes idle. The next node in sequence detecting resource idleness takes the floor if a local request has been recorded, or remains quiet. <p> A related case is floor control over a token bus, where a node passes the floor token along the list of stations attached to the bus. The delay in a token bus is inherently larger compared to a token ring <ref> [5] </ref> and will not be discussed. A shortcoming of STR is that a predefined token passing schedule does not reflect spontaneous interactivity. There are many variations on the detailed operation of floor control in a ring structure, concerning acquisition and release of the floor token. <p> AN EXAMPLE OF TREE-BASED FLOOR CONTROL 5.1. HGCP Description We outline the operation of the Hierarchical Group Coordination Protocol (HGCP) as an example for STT protocols. Although tree protocols have been the subject of related research, e.g., on mutual exclusion [28], channel access <ref> [5] </ref>, or reliable multicast [21,26,42], to our knowledge no tree-based group coordination protocol has been proposed in the literature. HGCP represents two innovations: floor control is inherently hierarchical, and the control tree for group coordination is correlated in its operation to an underlying tree-based multicast service.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION The increasing deployment of IP-multicast <ref> [9] </ref> has brought a new generation of collaborative multimedia applications (CMA) to mainstream computing. Such applications allow users to overcome their separation in time and space and share information and work efforts in real-time, with the goal to at least approximate the quality of face-to-face interactions.

Reference-contexts: Networked multimedia systems, operating with continuous media and high user interactivity, differ in their requirements significantly from traditional distributed systems, which handle discrete data and long-lived access privileges. Many solutions to mutual exclusion [33] or concurrency control are hence not applicable for CMA in a straightforward manner. Floor control <ref> [10] </ref> is a higher-level communication abstraction, which slowly gains acceptance as a building block in group coordination services.

Reference-contexts: User behavior in terms of the switching of control over a particular resource Dommel H.-P. et al. / Floor Control Protocols 11 is incorporated into this analysis with a turn taking model <ref> [11] </ref>, which serves as the conceptual blueprint for our analysis. A prototypical turn taking period is depicted in Figure 4, which shows the call pattern between stations and the effect on the particular controlled resource. The calls shown are explained in Section 5.

Reference-contexts: Group coordination in distributed systems and multimedia systems has many faces that have been manifested in user interfaces and network protocols. To this date, however, no commonly accepted recipe on designing group coordination algorithms exists. Ellis et al. <ref> [13] </ref> discuss groupware issues and coordination solutions from a user interface standpoint, geared towards tasks such as shared editing. Networked multimedia systems, operating with continuous media and high user interactivity, differ in their requirements significantly from traditional distributed systems, which handle discrete data and long-lived access privileges.

Reference-contexts: Sample applications are distributed interactive simulations, distance learning seminars, or special-purpose MBone sessions <ref> [14] </ref>.

The following benefits of floor control from a user and system perspective can be identified.

Reference-contexts: Queueing of requests adds the global and resource-local service order as another policy facet, e.g., first 4 Dommel H.-P. et al. / Floor Control Protocols come-first-served, or least-recently-served. Fluckiger <ref> [15] </ref> distinguishes between implicit vs. explicit signaling to acquire a floor, e.g., voice-activated speaker switching vs. hand-raising through the user interface. As another important dichotomy, floor control can be enforced in a centralized or distributed fashion [8,16]. <p> If a user contends for a floor and perceives remote activity, she would back off for a random short period and attempt to reclaim the floor, after remote activity subsided. RSF in video conferencing, as with the MBone tool vic [24], is often realized as "voluntary distributed control" <ref> [15] </ref>, where cooperative users switch video streams manually on and off, depending on whether they prefer to receive or send specific video transmissions. Analog POTS conferencing also relies on RSF, which works well for very small groups.

Reference-contexts: The consequences of these limitations are flawed telepresence and coordination problems concerning mutual awareness, speech initiation conflicts, and diminished interaction, as reported by Isaacs and Tang <ref> [18] </ref> in studies on video conferencing. However, telepresence can be improved both from a networking and user interface perspective by supplying an effective mediation protocol, which directs users on the fine line between exclusive, yet shared resource usage. <p> Both schemes are instable even at low request rates and collaboratory efficacy falls off quickly and the average delay becomes unbounded. This models the phenomenon that users avoid frequent turn-taking in telecollaboration <ref> [18] </ref>. RAS was a first attempt toward unintrusive machine-assisted floor control and performs very well for local area networks, where the system's responsiveness warrants quick updates and steady resource tapping.

Reference-contexts: A tree with n session participants and branching factor K has log K n levels, with log 2 n bits needed for node labels. The ack tree does not require modification to the router-internal IP multicast infrastructure. However, Levine and Garcia-Luna-Aceves have generalized labeling to the router level <ref> [20] </ref>, exploiting novel mechanisms of streaming and addressing. The ack tree structure enforces cascaded acks and negative acknowledgments across tree branches, and prevents receivers from contacting the source directly to confirm reception of packets or ask for retransmission of lost packets.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical organization of stations also supports inter-group collaboration, subgroup addressing, and allows more scalable and economic transmission of session data <ref> [21] </ref>. A tree-based group coordination protocol representing STT is discussed in Section 5. Control messages in a STT protocol are passed along branches of the tree in a parent-child relation reflecting multicast group membership. <p> HGCP represents two innovations: floor control is inherently hierarchical, and the control tree for group coordination is correlated in its operation to an underlying tree-based multicast service. The reliable multicast protocol Lorax <ref> [21] </ref> uses a single shared acknowledgment (ack) tree per session for multiple sources, instead of creating a separate tree per transmission.

Reference-contexts: Small sessions are set to n = 5, which is representative for PC-conferencing systems, and the value n = 300 for very large sessions corresponds to traces from MBone sessions <ref> [22] </ref>, sampled over a period of several hundred hours and indicating a group size ranging from 150 to over 550 participants.

Current web-centered applications facilitate asynchronous and transaction-oriented collaboration, and synchronous groupwork is limited mostly to text and chatting. The JETS system [32] is a recent example for a Java-based synchronous collaboration environment, with floor control provided by a simple locking mechanisms to prevent event collisions in the shared workspace.

Reference-contexts: The values for L and f have been derived by Takagi and Kleinrock <ref> [37] </ref>. Substituting our notation in these results, we obtain L = e (fl 0 +n*) and f = ((fl 0 + n*)) 1 e (fl 0 +n*) =(1 e (fl 0 +n*) ), respectively. <p> The length of an average unsuccessful activity period consists of one truncated activity lasting fl sec, followed by one or more similarly truncated activities sent within time Y sec, where 0 Y t . The expected value of Y is <ref> [37] </ref> Y = t 1 (1 e t ); therefore, the average duration of a failed contention period is fl + 2t 1 (1 e t ).

Reference-contexts: Sarin and Greif discussed floor control for text-based real-time conferencing and point out a potential efficacy gain by employing multicasting [30]. Schooler touches on floor control issues with regard to video and audio in surveying multimedia conferencing [31]. ITU standardization efforts on multipoint multimedia conferencing <ref> [38] </ref> are more geared towards circuit-switched networks and do not include multicast provisions.

Reference-contexts: Tree-based Coordination (STT) is a hybrid control solution based on the idea to perform floor control across a logical tree structure, which allows for more efficient mixing of individual media sources <ref> [39] </ref> and close correlation of the control geometry with the actual underlying multicast routing tree, or the end-to-end reliable multicast tree. Hierarchical organization of stations also supports inter-group collaboration, subgroup addressing, and allows more scalable and economic transmission of session data [21].

Reference-contexts: However, because hosts are typically heterogeneous, duplicated computations and consistent replication may be costly, and both implementation and run-time monitoring of a floor control system can become very complex. Distributed floor control has been proposed for the MERMAID system <ref> [40] </ref>, and in the form of a distributed voice-activated collision-sensing algorithm in the EMCE teleconferencing system [2]. EMCE supports a "free-for-all" floor policy in a local area network with ample bandwidth and low delay, allowing users to give brief feedback to a speaker without the need to take the floor.

Conf. on Distributed Comp. Sys., </booktitle> <month> June </month> <year> 1991. </year>
Reference-contexts: Only sources being granted the floor are allowed to consume bandwidth, and floor control directives can be used to reserve future bandwidth shares. Yavatkar <ref> [41] </ref> embeds floor control into a multiflow synchronization protocol for media streams, supporting causally ordered flow coordination by floor tokens on top of a reliable multicast protocol.

Reference-contexts: STR is particularly suited to ensure totally ordered and atomic delivery. Pendergast [27] discusses a group support system operating on a token ring. Ziegler et al. <ref> [43] </ref> analyze packet-switched voice conferencing mechanisms in a logical ring. A station that is ready to start an activity, captures the passing token, inserts a command sequence with address and control information, sends the activity packets within this turn period and transfers the token after completion to the successor station.
