Title: Simulating DNA-DNA Renaturation: Parameters and Implications for DNA Computer Implementations  
Author: Michael L. Best, Douglas S. J. De Couto, John N. Guidi, George E. Homsy, Boris Raykin and Daniel L. Rosenband 
Abstract: We show how computer simulation may be a useful tool for analysing the feasibility of DNA computers. We first present a review of DNA-DNA renaturation in the context of DNA separation reactions, and identify the key chemical parameters for these reactions. We then present an application of the discrete lattice gas technique to simulations of these reactions, and show how key reaction parameters can be simulated. Finally, we describe a sample simulation implementation on the CAM-8 cellular automata machine as well as a C implementation, and discuss the limitations of this technique.

Reference-contexts: False Negative Error Rates Speculation from the Literature In the discussion of the restricted model, an analysis was performed on the separate primitive <ref> ( Adleman 1995 ) </ref> . This was viewed at the time as the primary bottleneck, and the most troublesome of the primitives (in the restricted model, there is no explicit amplify operation). It was estimated that a separation would take on the order of t = 1000 sec. to complete.

Reference-contexts: We chose to simulate the renaturation reaction using lattice gas techniques, which are a class of cellular automata computations. It has been well documented that these lattice gas techniques can accurately simulate physical reality when properly applied, as in <ref> ( Boghosian 1990 ) </ref> and ( Hasslacher 1992 ) . We simulate a population of single stranded witness molecules together with a population of single stranded probe molecules.

Reference-contexts: One group proposes the use of PCR amplification to increase the multiplicity of +(W,p) prior to the separation steps, in order to ensure that sufficient number of appropriate witness molecules exist <ref> ( Boneh & Lipton 1996 ) </ref> . However, it should be noted that PCR is not a "clean" amplifier and introduces some additional problems (e.g., PCR produces a population of amplified products).

Reference-contexts: They estimate that their false negative rate is * fn = 1 2 . It should be noted that there is also considerable interest in DNA computational models where the oligonucleotide probes are affixed to a solid substrate, for example <ref> ( Cai et al. 1997 ) </ref> . No error rates are yet reported from these experiments. It is clear, from all of these papers, that the error rates suggested are conjectural, at best.

Reference-contexts: Without argument as to why, it is postulated that the false negative rate is * fn = 1 10 . In an attempt to duplicate the original Adleman experiment, separation was performed at the last step using 0.5 diameter streptavadin coated magnetic beads, to which oligonucleotide probes were bound <ref> ( Kaplan et al. 1995 ) </ref> . The renaturation was performed at room temperature by shaking the renaturation tube for 30 minutes at pH 8.0 and 3.0M NaCl.

Reference-contexts: The arguments presented again presume a false negative rate of * fn = 1 10 . In another group, the term extract, rather than separate, is used to emphasize that the operation "only extracts some of the required strands" <ref> ( Lipton 1995 ) </ref> . Without argument as to why, it is postulated that the false negative rate is * fn = 1 10 .

Reference-contexts: Purely conjectural numbers for false positive and false negative error rates were provided , with the false negative rate * fn = 1 In the refinery model, the same authors argue that the separation operation can be made arbitrarily correct by parallel compound separation <ref> ( Roweis et al. 1995 ) </ref> . The arguments presented again presume a false negative rate of * fn = 1 10 . <p> With today's macroscopic wet laboratory chemistry techniques, this is rather optimistic. 10 ; 1 There have been two fundamental approaches to improve the accuracy of the separate operation beyond the limits of the false negative error rate. One approach involves a compound separator, which uses countercurrent cascade stages <ref> ( Roweis et al. 1995 ) </ref> . Another approach notes that for a given separation ratio , the absolute number of witness molecules +(W; p) may be tiny.
