Abstract: We have studied the performance of a high-speed commercial spread-spectrum wireless LAN that uses the CSMA/CA multiple-access strategy. Employing synthetic workloads, we measured packet capture success more so than signal propagation characteristics. Specifically, we measured throughput, packet loss rates, range, and patterns of errors within packets. We conclude that CSMA/CA is quite successful in allocating bandwidth under stress, but that packet capture rate degrades very quickly once the LAN's effective range is exceeded. Hence, network maintainers should plan the layout of wireless networks at least as carefully as they plan wired networks.

Reference-contexts: Both types of computers had an "industry standard" (ISA) bus. Such a bus runs at 8 MHz, and is capable of transferring a byte every five cycles, yielding a maximum of 1.6 MB/sec between memory and I/O devices. All computers were running version 2.5 of the Mach operating system <ref> [1] </ref>, a descendant of UNIX. Packet transmission involves copying the packet from main memory into the WaveLAN's send buffer, where it resides until it is sent. The reverse path is taken when receiving a packet.

Reference-contexts: The question of signal propagation has received study for decades, and a great deal is known about propagation characteristics for broad ranges of values of many parameters, such as: frequency, modulation technique, multiple-access strategy, antenna design and placement, and fading environment <ref> [2, 6, 7, 5, 10] </ref>. From these studies, certain reasonably reliable predictions can be made about how a wireless LAN should behave. For example, knowledge of the fading environment, transmission power, frequency, and modulation technique should allow one to predict the effective range of a wireless LAN.

Reference-contexts: Instability outside of the preferred operating regime is not unique to wireless LANs; technologies such as Ethernet behave similarly <ref> [3] </ref>. When such unstable conditions do occur, it appears that packet length is a key parameter, with the smallest packets being captured much more successfully than the largest packets.

Reference-contexts: areas. * Provision of continuous LAN service to mobile users who carry portable computers. * The possibility that wireless LANs might provide lower "cost per seat," thus making them attractive for certain applications even in areas that are or can easily be wired. 1 These include: RF products (Motorola's Altair <ref> [4] </ref>, NCR's WaveLAN [12], Proxim's RangeLAN and Telesys-tems' Arlan) as well as IR products from Spectrix and Phonotics. If the wireless LAN is to replace or complement the traditional wired LAN, a significant question is how and to what extent wireless technologies handle packetized data traffic differently from wireline technologies.

Reference-contexts: We benefit from the fact that the signal propagation characteristics of our environment have al ready been studied <ref> [8] </ref>. * A LAN transmits, rejects, and resends data in the form of whole packets. * LAN traffic is burstier, and there is no "pause time" that can be used for control information. Section 2 explains the experimental setting of our study, while Section 3 reveals and interprets our measurements. <p> If the auto-correlation of spread bits is exact enough, the bits become indistinguishable and information is lost [11]. Our test environment has already been measured for delay spread and for how power drops off with distance <ref> [8] </ref>. The median delay spread in our environment at our frequency is 40ns; 75% of measured delay spreads were less than 50ns.

Reference-contexts: This fact plus the fact that most small packets can be captured even during periods of unstability, suggests that dynamic cell-to-cell handoff | such as that described in <ref> [9] </ref>, which requires exchange of a few small control packets | can be done efficiently with this sort of hardware. This conclusion is significant for wireless mobile computing. When packets are damaged (but still possible to capture), they tend to suffer from a small number of isolated bit errors.

Reference-contexts: The WaveLAN is equipped with two antennas, with hardware dynamically choosing to receive from the one exhibiting the highest signal quality. Such "antenna diversity" is effective in combating multipath, more so as the frequency increases <ref> [11] </ref>. The multiple-access strategy is CSMA/CA, CA standing for "collision avoidance." A potential sender listens and does not send until the channel is free. Transmission may continue during a collision, because the collision may not be detected. CSMA/CA is a reasonable multiple-access strategy for a wireless LAN. <p> If the auto-correlation of spread bits is exact enough, the bits become indistinguishable and information is lost <ref> [11] </ref>. Our test environment has already been measured for delay spread and for how power drops off with distance [8].

This device physically broadcasts every packet, with address filtering done in hardware following the Ethernet scheme (i.e., 48-bit station addresses). Transmission is via direct-sequence spread-spectrum transmission in the lowest of the three Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands, 902-928 MHz. <p> At the end of test runs, we read this information out of the operating system via /dev/kmem. According to <ref> [12] </ref>, the signal quality is defined as "a measure of an averaged correlation peak to side lobe ratio." In order words, it is a number (in dB) indicating the difference between the main radiation lobe and the primary side lobe. The larger this number, the clearer the signal.
