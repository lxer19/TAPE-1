Abstract: Detecting the most probable next page a user is bound to visit inside a website has important practical consequences: it allows to suggest recommendations to the visitors as to which may be the pages of interest to them in a complex website; it is of help for website designers for deciding how to organize the site contents and it is also useful for pre-caching voluminous objects that the user will very probably need. In sum, it helps to customize web contents. In order to achieve that goal a classification, prediction an evaluation cycle has to be performed. Among the several possible alternative technologies we discuss a real use of Bayesian Network representations. The obtained results are commented, compared to other approaches and its applicability to other domains is also discussed.

Reference-contexts: Note that a trajectory tree can be used as a very fine-grained user model at least in two different forms: as individual user model or as a description of a group of similar users. Note also that this user model is more powerful than a single belief vector description <ref> [4] </ref> in the sense that it allows performing powerful inferences on it, the same type of inferences a Bayesian Network allows. It is also important to remark that it can have the same reasoning power as a rule representation of classes but with a more compact representation.

Reference-contexts: Usuallly prototypes are represented as descriptor vectors [8, 2], probabilistic descriptor vectors <ref> [7] </ref>, decision trees [13] or rules [11]. We propose another way of representing classes that retains the sequential nature of the clustered objects, that is, visits. Given a class of visits we need to represent the structure of the most common followed paths, that is subsequences of visits.

The process for building a classification is very similar to the nearest neighbour algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>, the difference here is that each object is in fact an structured object, a visit. Each time a new visit V i is taken into consideration it has to be assigned a class.

Reference-contexts: We think that a similar approach can be followed but taking the initiative not from the point of view of the user, as searching agents <ref> [9] </ref> do, but from the side of where information lies: that is, the website. We can consider a wesite as being just a collection of pages connected through links. What is interesting for a web site designer is to be able to fullfill user's requests for information.

Reference-contexts: This is a predicate that establishes a degree of similarity between two objects. Similarity relationships are defined in many ways <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Later bu, defining a measure in the space of descriptors, it is possible to assess the similarity between two pages as a measure of the proximity of their corresponding description vectors in the descriptors space. This is the typical approach of classification and clustering theory, see for example <ref> [11] </ref>. Values for the descriptors can be entered directly by the builder of the website or calculated by inspecting the pages contents or key descriptors (HTML Tags, for example). <p> Usuallly prototypes are represented as descriptor vectors [8, 2], probabilistic descriptor vectors [7], decision trees [13] or rules <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If a list of descriptors has to be defined by the web-designer, tagging of pages have to be mandatory for all pages in the website and be consistently maintained, which is not an easy task, although there is a strong trend towards standardizing web page description <ref> [15] </ref>. So, we will develop another view of similarity between pages. From our point of view, given that similarity must be referred to each individual user, it has to be defined in other terms. Again several alternatives are possible.

Reference-contexts: Log files store such traces. Usually, information in a log file does not allow 4 precise individual identification of a user. However there are techniques to distinguish one user individual hit from another <ref> [24] </ref>. We say that pages are similar for a user if they are close in any visit the user paid to the site, that is if they are in close positions in a sequence. So, similarity becomes a relationship of proximity in a space of visits. <p> This is a powerful representation in the sense that allows quite detailed and refined responses to complex queries. There is a strong assumption here which is the one implied by this transformation: that the sequences can be represented by a regular grammar.
