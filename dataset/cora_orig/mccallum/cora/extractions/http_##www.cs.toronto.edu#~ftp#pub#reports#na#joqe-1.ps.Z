Abstract: We present a numerical method for solving a set of coupled mode equations describing light propagation through a medium with a grating and free carriers. The carriers, which are excited by the light and decay exponentially, lower the refractive index, thus rendering the system nonlinear. The method is fourth-order accurate, efficient, stable, easy to implement and well suited for vector and parallel computers. In addition, it can be extended to handle diffusive carrier effects.

In the experiments of Sankey et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, the carriers have a decay time of about 1 ns, while the pulse length of the incoming radiation is 25 to 50 ns. fl This work was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Information Technology Research Centre of Ontario, and by the <p> In modeling their experimental results, Sankey et al. <ref> [2] </ref> thus find that they have to account explicitly for the finite lifetime of the carriers. However, their model is simplified since the grating has a length of only 80 m, so that the roundtrip time, in the absence of the grating and the nonlinearity, is only a few ps. <p> This allows them to use a "quasi-CW" approximation in which propagation effects of the light are ignored <ref> [2] </ref>. Due to the sluggish nonlinearity and the long incident pulses, Sankey et al. [2] could probe the (quasi-) CW properties only of their system. Indeed, they demonstrated that nonlinear periodic media exhibit all-optical switching, a property first predicted by Winful et al.

Following Sankey et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, we take dN = h <br>- 2n N : (3) The first term on the right side of (3) is the standard expression for the rate of creation of carriers due to the intensity of light: ff is the absorption coefficient and his the photon energy. <p> Since the corrector (22) converges rapidly, as explained in [6], we have found that three iterations of A1-C1 is the most that is necessary. 3 Numerical Example Fig. 2 shows the reflection and transmission for a planar silicon waveguide with a grating etched into the surface, as in Sankey's system <ref> [2] </ref>, as a function of time in roundtrip times. Since the refractive index n = 3:3076 and length L = 0:008 cm, the roundtrip time in the absence of the grating and the nonlinearity is 1:675 ps. <p> For this example, the following parameters for the grating were used: = 757:03 cm 1 , and 2K e = = 5:25567 fi 10 17 m 3 , which are the appropriate parameters for Sankey's system <ref> [2] </ref>. Finally, t = 10 ps. <p> Perhaps a more practical extension of the method would be to allow diffusion.

However, confirmation of other properties of gap solitons requires pulse propagation experiments. To this end, Brown <ref> [5] </ref> and co-workers plan to extend their experiments to investigate shorter time scales by shortening the pulse length of their laser and by reducing the lifetime of the free carriers in a new set of experiments currently under design.

Reference-contexts: The standard theoretical treatment of such systems proceeds via the coupled mode equations (CME's), which describe the evolution of the amplitudes of the modes involved. In a previous paper by two of us <ref> [6] </ref>, a numerical procedure to solve the CME's for a grating structure with a Kerr nonlinearity was developed. This fourth-order method, which makes use of the characteristics of the CME's, was shown to be efficient and stable. <p> However, this method cannot be used directly in simulations of the experiments described above in which both the carrier dynamics as well as the propagation effects of the light must be included. The algorithm presented earlier <ref> [6] </ref> integrates along characteristics x + t constant and x + t constant, where x and t are the space and time coordinates, respectively, corresponding to free propagation of light through the system in the forward and backward directions (we have set the speed of light to unity ). <p> This suggests that Eqs. (7)-(8) for F + and F can be integrated efficiently in and t , respectively, by a fourth-order ODE technique similar to the one presented in de Sterke et al. <ref> [6] </ref> for the CME's. However, our earlier approach is not immediately applicable to the present problem since the carriers do not propagate and their characteristics are not in either the or the t direction [Eq. (9)], but in the t direction [Eq. (3)]. <p> We elaborate on this below. 2.2 Review of the previously used method Before explaining our numerical method for solving equations (1)-(5), we briefly review the algorithm described in <ref> [6] </ref> for wave propagation through a grating with a Kerr nonlinearity. The fields F + and F in this similar, but simpler, problem can be described by a pair of CME's similar to Eqs. (1)-(2), but which depend on F + and F only, not N . <p> These are available (in most cases) because of the grid structure we have adopted, as can be seen easily from Fig. 1. (We explain in <ref> [6] </ref> how to cope with the exceptional points at which values for F + and/or F are not available.) In a similar way, we compute initial approximations for both F + and F along all other characteristics in the grid associated with the time interval [t k ; t k+1 ]. <p> This leads to an implicit fourth-order three- stage collocation method for ODE's that is closely related to Simpson's rule for quadrature, as explained in <ref> [6] </ref>. Although higher-order three-stage collocation schemes for ODE's can be obtained by choosing different interpolation points, values for both F + and F would not be immediately available at those points, as can again be seen easily from Fig. 1. <p> The initial, mid and end points are ideally suited for the characteristic grid naturally associated with this problem. As a result, choosing these points leads to an effective numerical scheme for the CME's, as is explained in more detail in <ref> [6] </ref>. 2.3 Interpolation procedure We now turn to the problem at hand, Eqs. (1)-(5), for which the nonlinearity is due to the free carriers. The characteristics for the free carrier equation (3) are vertical lines on which x is constant. <p> This is discussed in more detail in the appendix of <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> We use a similar approximation to F + (L; t k + h=2) with a similar error estimate. 2.4 Implementation Having derived fourth-order approximations to all the values needed in the integration scheme proposed by de Sterke et al. <ref> [6] </ref> that do not arise "naturally" in the method, the integration procedure can now proceed apace. We first briefly review our predictor-corrector scheme for integrating a system of ODE's y 0 (x) = f (x; y (x)). <p> We first briefly review our predictor-corrector scheme for integrating a system of ODE's y 0 (x) = f (x; y (x)). We then describe how to apply this method to integrate Eqs. (3) and (7)-(8) along their associated characteristics. As discussed in detail in Ref. <ref> [6] </ref>, to integrate y 0 (x) = f (x; y (x)) from (x n ; y n ) to (x n+1 ; y n+1 ) over a distance h = x n+1 x n , we first interpolate (x n1 ; y n1 ), (x n1=2 ; y n1=2 ), and <p> 31 f (x n1 ; y n1 ) + ^a 32 f (x n1=2 ; y n1=2 ) + ^a 33 f (x n ; y n ) where the values of the coefficients f^a ij g are listed in Table 1 below as well as in Table 1 of <ref> [6] </ref>. This predictor is not applicable at the start of the integration, since the required past values (x n1 ; y n1 ) and (x n1=2 ; y n1=2 ) are not available. <p> The values of the coefficients fa ij g are also listed in Table 1 below as well as in Table 1 of <ref> [6] </ref>. As explained in [6], the corrector (22) is based upon a fourth-order three-stage collocation formula. As a result, if (22) is iterated a sufficient number of times, y (k+1) (k+1) n+1 will be fourth-order approximations to y (x n + h=2) and y (x n+1 ), respectively. <p> The values of the coefficients fa ij g are also listed in Table 1 below as well as in Table 1 of <ref> [6] </ref>. As explained in [6], the corrector (22) is based upon a fourth-order three-stage collocation formula. As a result, if (22) is iterated a sufficient number of times, y (k+1) (k+1) n+1 will be fourth-order approximations to y (x n + h=2) and y (x n+1 ), respectively. <p> Since the corrector (22) converges rapidly, as explained in <ref> [6] </ref>, we have found that three iterations of A1-C1 is the most that is necessary. 3 Numerical Example Fig. 2 shows the reflection and transmission for a planar silicon waveguide with a grating etched into the surface, as in Sankey's system [2], as a function of time in roundtrip times. <p> of the incoming pulse, the dotted line is jF (t; 0)j 2 , the reflected intensity, while the dashed line is jF + (t; L)j 2 , the transmitted intensity. 4 Discussion and Conclusion The method described here is an extension of the algorithm presented by de Sterke et al. <ref> [6] </ref> that we have found to be highly effective. However, the earlier method is limited to CME's corresponding to Eqs. (1)-(2), but which depend on F + and F only, not N : it cannot be applied directly to Eqs. (1)-(3). Our new method uses interpolation to remove this restriction. <p> However, the earlier method is limited to CME's corresponding to Eqs.

Like our earlier method <ref> [6] </ref>, the new scheme is efficient, stable, easy to implement and well suited for vector and parallel computers. In particular, since the method is fourth- order accurate, we can employ a large stepsize h = L=J while still maintaining a high level of precision.
