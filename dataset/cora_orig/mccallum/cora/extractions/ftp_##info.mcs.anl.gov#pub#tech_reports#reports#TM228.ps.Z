Reference-contexts: Therefore, a nonuniform mesh with higher resolution is used in parts of the structure where the stress gradients are high, and with lower resolution where the stress gradients are low is desired. In the work in <ref> [1] </ref>, a GA is used to search for an optimal mesh. Initially, a uniform mesh is imposed on a loaded structure with a small number of degrees of freedom that are not com-putationally burdensome. An energy-based error norm is calculated and used as an objective function to be minimized.

Reference-contexts: Because of the computationally expensive nature of the branch exchange procedure, a hash function was written for PGAPack that prevents previously evaluated strings from being evaluated again. The addition of the hash function reduced the processing time approximately 30%. 4.5 Evolutionary Robotics The work in <ref> [2] </ref> describes the use of genetic algorithms to design neural network controllers for a simulated, box-pushing robot. The world of the robot is a small grid with blocks randomly placed on it.

Reference-contexts: The user then has the option of using the "hand-docked" solution to replace the worst conformation in the population, to reseed the entire population using random perturbations of the hand-docked solution, or to make no changes at all. 4.2 Quantum Chemistry Parameter Optimization In <ref> [3] </ref> PGAPack was used to study chemical reactions in the condensed phase. The goal was to develop a quantum mechanical (QM) simulation code that could determine accurate values for certain molecular properties (e.g., the heat of formation, dipole moments, atomic bond lengths, 6 dihedral angles).

In ACM SIGGRAPH '93 Proceedings, </booktitle> <pages> pages 135-142. </pages> <publisher> Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, </publisher> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: The speedup achieved is fairly constant, although not ideal. Several solutions with better energy values than the x-ray crystallographic solution were found. A novel feature of STALK is the use of virtual-reality (VR) technology to provide an interactive computational steering capability. In the CAVE <ref> [4] </ref>, a room-sized VR environment that communicates with the IBM SP through an SGI Onyx workstation front-end, the best conformation in the population and associated energy are displayed. Using a pointing device in the CAVE, the user may translate and/or rotate the ligand.

Reference-contexts: PGAPack is implemented by using the message-passing interface (MPI) standard <ref> [5] </ref>. MPI is a specification of a message-passing library for parallel computers and workstation networks; it defines a set of functions and their behavior.

Reference-contexts: Each robot must be evaluated in more than one initial configuration, and each configuration requires several hundred time steps. A parallel version of PGAPack was installed on an SGI workstation network and used to corroborate previous results. In addition, a version of niching based on the work in <ref> [6] </ref> was added to PGAPack to support multi-objective optimization. A custom function was written that performed selection by choosing two strings randomly from the population and returning the one which dominates a random sample of the population.

Reference-contexts: Our focus is on parallel execution and custom extensions to PGAPack. 4.1 Molecular Docking STALK <ref> [7] </ref> is a system for molecular docking that uses PGAPack. The goal in molecular docking is to predict the conformation (location and orientation) of a ligand (a small molecule) in a protein active site (the part of the protein that the ligand binds to). 5 Table 1: Solution Time vs.

Reference-contexts: ACTHS is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem; a problem with N stands and M planning periods has M N integer solutions (including infeasible solutions). A typical operational scheduling problem has 10-20 periods and 500-1000 stands. In <ref> [8] </ref> the authors compare a traditional GA that represents solutions directly on the chromosomes with an order-based GA that represents permutations of the stand identification numbers on the chromosomes and uses each permutation as an order list for scheduling stands, with Monte Carlo integer programming (MCIP).

Reference-contexts: This project was so successful that the order-based GA is now the in-house production planning system for ACTHS at Rayonier Corp. 4.4 Vehicle Clustering In <ref> [9] </ref> the authors describe the application of PGAPack to the Multiple-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP). The MDVRP is an extension of the vehicle routing problem, with the cus 7 tomers being served from multiple depots instead of a single, central depot.
