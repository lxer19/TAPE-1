Reference-contexts: The claim is that the cascade is again smoothly stabilizable; in other words, integrating the control does not destroy smooth stabilizability. This result was proved before by [2], in the context of "PD control" of mechanical systems, as well as [9] and <ref> [1] </ref>. In [8], an application to rigid body control is given. Here we wish to show how the existence of fi gives a very natural, and alternative, stabilization technique. <p> The fact that in the example we could choose fi 1 is no accident. In general for systems linear in controls that will be possible, as follows from the main result in [5]. For another example, take the system _x = x 5 + y 2 considered in <ref> [1] </ref>. The first system is already BIBS and asystable for y 0, so the control law u := x 2 y stabilizes the cascade. (This is simpler than the solution given in that reference.

Reference-contexts: Observe also that under extra (and fairly restrictive) hypotheses on the first system, such as that f be globally Lipschitz, the CIBS conditions can be relaxed -the paper <ref> [3] </ref> provides a detailed discussion of this issue, which was previously considered in [10] and [4]. If the system (3) does not satisfy the CIBS property, it can be modified under feedback so that this becomes true.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if one can in any way insure that solutions of the first system do not blow up for small controls, then the cascade's global asystability follows from that of its components. This was proved in [6] using a stronger property than CIBS, "input to state stability (ISS)" (see <ref> [5] </ref> for the definition of the concept of ISS). Comparisons between ISS and BIBS stability are discussed in [6]. Here we show that the same result follows under the weaker hypothesis. <p> The fact that in the example we could choose fi 1 is no accident.

Reference-contexts: This follows from classical "total stability" theorems, and was proved for instance in [11] and in a somewhat different manner in <ref> [6] </ref> using Lyapunov techniques. (An elementary proof is indicated below.) The local stabilization of (CAS) can then be achieved if (1) is already stable and the y-subsystem of (CAS) is stabilizable. <p> Then the cascade (CAS) has (0; 0) as a globally asymptotically stable state. Thus, if one can in any way insure that solutions of the first system do not blow up for small controls, then the cascade's global asystability follows from that of its components. This was proved in <ref> [6] </ref> using a stronger property than CIBS, "input to state stability (ISS)" (see [5] for the definition of the concept of ISS).

Comparisons between ISS and BIBS stability are discussed in [6]. Here we show that the same result follows under the weaker hypothesis. <p> In terms of cascades, S fi f0g is then a stable attractor for the system (CAS). 3 Stabilization In <ref> [6] </ref> we proved a stronger version (the one there is for "input to state stability") of this fact: If the system (1) has the origin globally asymptotically sta-ble, then there exists an everywhere nonzero smooth function fi : IR n ! IR such that the system _x = f (x; fi <p> is some K so that rV (~):f (~; fi (~)v) &lt; 0 whenever jvj and j~j &gt; K. (The existence of fi follows from a simple continuity argument, because rV (~):f (~; w) &lt; 0 for all jwj &lt; (~) for some function ; see Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 in <ref> [6] </ref>.) If u () is any control converging to 0 and x (0) = x 0 is given, we need to prove that x (t), the trajectory for (4), cannot diverge. Let be a bound on u, and pick K as above.

Reference-contexts: is true for _y = g (y; u), what can one conclude about the cascade? More particularly, what can be said if the "zero-input" system _x = f (x; 0) (1) is already known to be asymptotically stable? There are many reasons for studying these problems; see the tutorial paper <ref> [7] </ref> for motivations and references. The simplest result along these lines is local, and it states that a cascade of locally asymptotically stable systems is again asystable.
