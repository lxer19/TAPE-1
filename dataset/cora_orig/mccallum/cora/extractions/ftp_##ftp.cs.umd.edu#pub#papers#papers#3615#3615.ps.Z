Abstract: This report reviews the present state of the art in selection of texts in one language based on queries in another, a problem we refer to as "multilingual" text retrieval. Present applications of multilingual text retrieval systems are limited by the cost and complexity of developing and using the multilingual thesauri on which they are based and by the level of user training that is required to achieve satisfactory search effectiveness. A general model for multilingual text retrieval is used to review the development of the field and to describe modern production and experimental systems. The report concludes with some observations on the present state of the art and an extensive bibliography of the technical literature on multilingual text retrieval. fl The research reported herein was supported, in part, by Army Research Office contract DAAL03-91-C-0034 through Battelle Corporation, NSF NYI IRI-9357731, Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow Award BR3336, a General Research Board Semester Award, and the Logos Corporation.

Reference-contexts: In an ideal text retrieval system, c (q (query); d (doc)) = j (query; doc); 8query 2 Q; 8doc 2 D; where j : Q fi D 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> represents the user's judgement of some relationship between two texts, measured on a single ordinal scale (e.g., content similarity or style similarity).

Reference-contexts: Documents can then be compared using the cosine similarity measure and ranked for display in the usual way. LSI has been applied to multilingual text retrieval in a similar way to the relevance feedback technique described above <ref> [5, 37, 38, 76] </ref>. The basic approach is best illustrated by Landauer and Littman [38]. Randomly selecting 900 training paragraphs and 1,582 evaluation paragraphs from the Hansards collection, a parallel corpus of Canadian parliamentary proceedings, they first applied LSI to identify the principal components of the training set. <p> Unfortunately, the lack of a bilingual corpus with available relevance judgements precluded a more traditional recall-precision evaluation. Berry and Young repeated this work using passages from the Bible in English and Greek <ref> [5] </ref>. They were able to demonstrate that fine-grained training data, using only the first verse of each passage to identify the principal components, improved retrieval performance over Landauer and Littman's coarse-grained approach.

Reference-contexts: More recently, a team at the University of Huddersfield Centre for Database Access Research in the United Kingdom led by Pollitt has integrated multilingual thesauri with interactive personal computer technology to address one of the fundamental limitations of controlled vocabulary text retrieval <ref> [6, 40, 54, 55] </ref>. Experience has shown that although the domain knowledge that can be encoded in a thesaurus permits experienced users to form more precise queries, casual and intermittent users have difficulty exploiting the expressive power of a traditional query interface in exact match retrieval systems.

Reference-contexts: An alternative to Salton's representation of concepts in R is to represent terms, using the multilingual thesaurus to guide the term selection process. This is a variation on query expansion, a well studied technique for monolingual text retrieval <ref> [9] </ref>. 34 The basic idea of query expansion is to accommodate term usage variations by augmenting the terms in the query with related terms. But because query expansion typically improves recall at the expense of precision, selection of inappropriate terms could reduce overall performance measures such as average precision.

Reference-contexts: Because we know of no published research results from these projects, we simply describe their stated objectives briefly. In December of 1993 a team led by Laus-Maczynska of the French firm Cap Gemini Innovation began work on the CRISTAL project <ref> [11] </ref>. 65 A part of the I*M-Europe Language Engineering program, CRISTAL is being designed to retrieve documents from a French collection using queries in French, English or Italian using the French Dicologique thesaurus.

Reference-contexts: TRANSLIB's goal is development of a trilingual (Greek, Spanish and English) subject search capability for an online library catalog. Chachra discussed user needs assessment for multilingual online library catalogs in <ref> [12] </ref> more generally, and provided examples from the VTLS online library catalog system. In addition to monolingual full text searching, VTLS used a multilingual thesaurus to suggest controlled vocabulary search terms in a second language. <p> In general, the goal of ranked retrieval is not to replace exact match techniques but rather to augment them with techniques that improve the search effectiveness of untrained users. In multilingual text retrieval, ranked retrieval techniques also allow us to avoid an unsolved problem identified by Chachra <ref> [12] </ref>, who observed that single terms in one language can correspond to complex boolean expressions in another when a controlled vocabulary is not decimal system, as a multilingual subject thesaurus. 31 The exception is the SPIRIT system developed for EMIR which we discuss below. 32 Dubois discounted this factor, but his

Reference-contexts: First published in 1984, EUROVOC now includes all nine official languages of the European Community, and portions of it have been translated into additional languages (c.f. <ref> [13] </ref>). 26 Thesaurus design remains expensive, and this fact has limited the domains to which which controlled vocabulary retrieval has been applied. But EUROVOC demonstrates that once the basic concept relationships have been defined for a domain, extension of an ISO 5964 multilingual thesaurus to additional languages is quite practical.

Reference-contexts: Before proceeding it might be useful to identify related research that is outside the scope of this survey. The term "multilingual" is also commonly used to refer to text retrieval systems which can be parameterized to search in one of several languages (c.f. <ref> [14] </ref>). In such systems both the query and the documents must in the same language, so such systems are actually monolingual text retrieval systems. <p> INQUIRY, developed by Croft and others at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is an example of a probabilistic text retrieval system <ref> [14] </ref>. 3.3.1 Automatic Thesaurus Construction In a sense, corpus-based techniques can be viewed as a type of automatic thesaurus construction technique in which information about the relationship between terms is obtained from observed statistics of term usage. <p> Finally, in a 1995 research paper on adaptation of the INQUIRY probabilistic text retrieval system for monolingual text retrieval in languages other than English, Croft and others from the University of Massachusetts briefly described future plans to investigate cross-linguistic text retrieval <ref> [14] </ref>. 4 Some Observations on the State of the Art We will now take advantage of the background we have developed to make a few observations on the present state of multilingual text retrieval practice and research.

Reference-contexts: The difference is that in this case the "thesaurus" need not be constructed by humans. As with many other multilingual text retrieval techniques, automatic thesaurus construction has a significant research heritage in a monolingual context <ref> [15] </ref>. A substantial amount of research has appeared 18 on this subject has been reported in the machine translation literature. For the present survey we describe two techniques for automatically constructing multilingual thesauri from a text retrieval perspective.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly, although this approach has been suggested repeatedly in recent years <ref> [16, 25, 47, 72] </ref> we are aware of only one experiment for which results have been reported [26, 25, 57, 58]. One weakness of present fully automatic machine translation systems is that they are able to produce high quality translations only in limited domains. <p> Recently, Davis and Dunning of New Mexico State University have evaluated several multilingual text retrieval techniques, one of which is based on query expansion <ref> [16] </ref>. For the evaluation of Spanish text retrieval at the fourth Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-4) they manually translated 25 Spanish queries into English and then used them to select documents from a collection of 58,000 Spanish articles from the Mex-ican newspaper "El Norte" using the INQUIRY text retrieval system. <p> In their TREC-4 experiment, Davis and Dunning tried three more complex term vector translation techniques <ref> [16, 17, 18] </ref>. Using 80,000 pairs of aligned sentences from a parallel corpus of United Nations documents, they first selected the 8,000 English sentences that were most similar to their English translations of each TREC query. <p> This technique achieved an average precision of 0.02. Davis and Dunning's final technique was based on direct translation of term vectors <ref> [16, 23] </ref> using a linear operator. They began by forming one matrix from a collection of tfidf vectors derived from the English version of the aligned sentences and a second matrix derived from the Spanish versions of the same sentences. <p> Without either scored parallel corpora or some way of estimating the effect of a domain difference it will not be possible to draw conclusive observations from large-scale studies such as those conducted by Davis and Dunning <ref> [16] </ref>. The performance of monolingual techniques under the same experimental conditions appears to be a good benchmark for an upper bound on retrieval effectiveness. There is presently no evidence that multilingual techniques can reliably exceed the performance of monolingual techniques.

The SABINI system was designed for automation of bibliographic records in an online library catalog. Sogoaga provided no examples of implementations for specific languages, however. In 1988 Kitano, from NEC's Tokyo Software Engineering Development Laboratory, described the development of a hardware tool designed to support multilingual text retrieval [36].

Reference-contexts: a statistical text retrieval system to exploit imprecise information, but the technique has not yet been implemented and construction of the required bilingual term list may be a formidable task. 3.3.3 Latent Semantic Indexing Another statistical technique that has been applied to multilingual text retrieval is Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) <ref> [21] </ref>. The basic idea is to use a matrix decomposition to identify the principal components of the vector space defined by the document collection, and then project the vectors into the space spanned by those principal components.

Reference-contexts: After all, if we are to improve on present practice we must understand the limitations of present systems. Three key factors bear examination in this regard: cost, usability by untrained users, and effectiveness <ref> [22] </ref>. Thesaurus construction is an expensive activity. But thesaurus use can be even more expensive because in a controlled vocabulary system every document must be assigned terms that reflect the concepts it contains. 32 .

Reference-contexts: This distinction also provides the basis for multilingual text retrieval, which is simply a special case of the paraphrase problem <ref> [25] </ref>, so we spend a moment to formalize this idea. the domain of the query representation function q is Q, the collection of possible queries and it's range is R, the unified space of text (i.e., query and document) representations. <p> set of documents is expanded to increase recall. 8 Full precision-recall plots can be useful when the decay rate of precision with increasing recall differs so markedly that each system outperforms the other for some value of recall. 3 Approaches to Multilingual Text Retrieval Building on recent work by Fluhr <ref> [25] </ref>, we next present a taxonomy of multilingual text retrieval approaches. Three main themes have emerged in the research literature: thesaurus-based approaches, corpus-based approaches and modular use of machine translation for text translation. <p> Surprisingly, although this approach has been suggested repeatedly in recent years <ref> [16, 25, 47, 72] </ref> we are aware of only one experiment for which results have been reported [26, 25, 57, 58].

One weakness of present fully automatic machine translation systems is that they are able to produce high quality translations only in limited domains. <p> Fluhr observes that text retrieval systems are typically more tolerant of syntactic than semantic translation errors, but that semantic accuracy suffers when insufficient domain knowledge is encoded into a translation system <ref> [25] </ref>. 9 Since encoding domain knowledge can be expensive, Fluhr's observation would suggest that the effectiveness of a machine translation approach to multilingual text retrieval will be limited, particularly when it is the relatively short queries that are translated. 8 Because there may be fewer relevant documents than recall points, step <p> In particular, we consider techniques which map sets of tfidf term weights from one language to another, a process we call term vector translation. Fluhr describes a particularly simple technique which provides a good starting point for our discussion <ref> [25] </ref>. Consider a two language case in which we have three subcollections, one in English, one in French and one which is parallel (i.e. every document in the parallel collection appears in paired English and French versions).

Another issue is that users frequently adopt a vocabulary that differs significantly from that in the documents that contain the information they seek <ref> [29] </ref>. This is known as the "paraphrase problem." One way that text retrieval systems accommodate such differences is by constructing representation functions that treat queries and documents differently to arrive at compatible representations.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, integration of thesauri with techniques based on corpus statistics is an area of active research in computational linguistics, and there is some indication that the best features from each can be captured when the two techniques are combined <ref> [30] </ref>. Because the most sophisticated multilingual text retrieval thesauri in existence are in controlled vocabulary systems, ongoing research efforts would likely benefit from leveraging what has been learned in this work.

Reference-contexts: tight. 15 tion by using the Spanish queries directly, so Davis and Dunning's results suggest that unconstrained query expansion is of limited value for multilingual text retrieval. 37 Building on this work, Hull and Grefenstette at Rank-Xerox in France have evaluated the potential of more sophisticated approaches to query expansion <ref> [32] </ref>. <p> In order to deal with this effect, Hull and Grefenstette have proposed using structural information from the document space to enhance domain-specific interpretation of the query <ref> [32] </ref> and Radwan and Fluhr have implemented a simple version of this approach. In contrast, Oard and his colleagues suggested exploiting the structure of user interest evidence gained over time [47].

Reference-contexts: Commercial acceptance soon followed, and by 1977 Iljon was able to identify four multilingual text retrieval systems operating in Europe <ref> [34] </ref>. Since this early work, six principal lines of research on multilingual thesauri have emerged: design standards, development and maintenance tools, special purpose hardware, new language pairs and domains, user interfaces, and user needs assessment.

Reference-contexts: The SABINI system was designed for automation of bibliographic records in an online library catalog. Sogoaga provided no examples of implementations for specific languages, however. In 1988 Kitano, from NEC's Tokyo Software Engineering Development Laboratory, described the development of a hardware tool designed to support multilingual text retrieval <ref> [36] </ref>. He implemented a Japanese-English thesaurus using a NEC integrated circuit known as the "Intelligent String Search Processor." At the time, the ISSP thesaurus implementation had not been integrated with a text retrieval system, however, so no experimental results were reported. <p> The development of techniques for approximate matching of conceptual graphs would be useful in this regard. Kitano's 1988 paper described a Direct Memory Access Parser (DMAP) implementation, a system he calls "SMAP," using the same hardware <ref> [36] </ref>. SMAP was designed to extract concepts from multilingual sentences and use them to fill a case frame. 49 Reported parsing speeds were better than one millisecond per word for sentences of up to 10 words.

Ranked retrieval systems typically accept queries in natural language and allow a (relatively) unconstrained choice of terms.

Reference-contexts: A similar relationship exists between multilingual text retrieval and fully automatic machine translation.

Reference-contexts: By "multilingual text retrieval" we mean the retrieval of documents (or, more precisely, electronic texts) based on explicit queries formulated by a human using natural language, regardless of the language in which the documents and the query are expressed. Neville has called this a "multilingually searchable system" <ref> [44] </ref>. Because the monolingual text retrieval problem has been well studied [28], we emphasize the cross-language aspect of text retrieval, the case in which queries are expressed in a language different from that of the documents.

Reference-contexts: As large multilingual thesauri have proliferated, design and maintenance tools have become increasingly important. In 1970, Neville described a procedure for merging thesauri that could be used to merge monolingual thesauri to produce a multilingual thesaurus <ref> [45] </ref>, and in 1975 he contrasted this approach with other ways of producing multilingual thesauri [46].

Reference-contexts: these values with reference to the monolingual technique in an attempt to facilitate comparison with other approaches. 10 For a 1973 paper Salton implemented an English-French multilingual concept list, this time achieving more complete coverage by independently developing the section for each language after establishing a common set of concepts <ref> [63] </ref>. Again, no information about the relationships between concepts was encoded or used. <p> Approved in 1978 as ISO 5964 and most recently modified in 1985, the standard describes how 20 A parallel corpus is a collection of documents in which every document is translated into every language. 21 PNP-2 stands for "Pusto-Nepusto-2." In his 1973 paper <ref> [63] </ref>, Salton translates the name of Pevzner's system as "Empty-Nonempty 2" and transliterates Pevzner's name as "Pevsner." 22 The examples Pevzner provides are all between 2 and 5 words. 23 Unfortunately, the cited definitions of "losses" and "noise" are in Russian, and Pevzner's summary of their definition appears to be incomplete.

Reference-contexts: For a comparison of relevance with "utility" see, for example, [69]. 6 measure for such systems is "average precision" <ref> [65] </ref>. It is computed by choosing successively larger sets of documents from the top of the ranked list that result in evenly spaced values of recall between zero and one. Five (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9), nine or eleven recall points are typically used. <p> Furthermore, there is some evidence that thesaurus designers have more difficulty anticipating which concepts and relationships will be useful to their system's eventual users than a cursory inspection of the thesaurus would suggest <ref> [65] </ref>. 33 Since corpus-based techniques are based on the observed statistics of term usage, they offer some hope that important aspects of current term usage can be identified and exploited. <p> Because the normalized inner product of two vectors is the cosine of the angle between the vectors in a vector space, the normalized inner product is known as the cosine similarity measure. SMART, developed by Salton at Cornell University, is an example of a vector space text retrieval system <ref> [65] </ref>. Probabilistic retrieval techniques typically implement a more complex c function.
