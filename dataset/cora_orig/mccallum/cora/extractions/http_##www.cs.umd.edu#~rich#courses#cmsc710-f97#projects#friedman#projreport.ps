Abstract: CMSC 710 Project Report: A Performance Abstract Satellites are excellently suited for multicast communication. As in any electronic communication, it is at least somewhat likely the information multicasted using a satellite will be corrupted in transmission, and so will not arrive in perfect condition at all receivers. Accordingly, forward error correction (FEC) and/or automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) error control schemes must be employed to preserve fidelity in the communication. However, the throughput in a typical multicast ARQ system is often poor if the number of receivers is large, since each retransmission typically benefits only very few receiving stations while all others wait unproductively. One way the throughput in a satellite ARQ multicast network might be improved is to supplement the satellite link with terrestrial links between the receivers and the transmitter. The flow of new packets through the multicast satellite link of such a hybrid network need not be interrupted if retransmissions were to be sent terrestrially, and so the throughput need not suffer as greatly as in a pure-satellite network. In this work, we present a performance study to compare the throughput provided by the hybrid and pure-satellite systems.

Reference-contexts: the same as attainable in a pure-satellite network having an error-free satellite channel. 2.3.4 Throughput ExamplePoint-to-Point Networks Example 1 As an example of throughput in point-to-point networks, let us assume ` = 2200 (approximately the optimal packet length in for operation in a satellite network with BER = 10 5 <ref> [1] </ref>) and h = 48 (allowing for a a 16-bit sequence number and a 32-bit CRC).

Reference-contexts: While not possible in practice, a selective-repeat ARQ protocol with an infinite numbering modulus and a finite window can be modified to work with a numbering modulus as small as twice the window size <ref> [2] </ref>. Hence this particular assumption is essentially only an implementation detail and may be applied with no loss of generality throughout our analysis. We mention it here only for correspondence with the earlier assumption of a infinite window size. * No ARQ timer expirations.

Reference-contexts: We point out that an ARQ protocol implementation using a sufficiently large window size, and a correspondingly large sequence number modulus and amount of buffering, can approach in performance an ideal-SR ARQ protocol (see, for example, <ref> [3] </ref>). We therefore assert that although these assumptions reflect a definite departure from the actual system, the resulting model bears a good resemblance to the actual system, and also allows for an analysis which would otherwise be intractable. <p> We accordingly present the queueing system model depicted in Figure 2.1 as a model of our actual system. (This queueing system is similar to that presented in <ref> [3] </ref>.) We present this queueing model primarily for the purpose of describing the operation of the system, but the subsequent analysis does not rest heavily upon queueing theory. 9 propagation propagation transmission 1 delay (t ) delay (t ) queue 2 queue 1 () 1 p s Data packets arrive continually <p> We have chosen the T1 rate for the satellite channel as it is a standard rate for high-bandwidth communication and because of its popularity in the literature (see, for example, <ref> [3] </ref>). We also choose a 33600-b/s rate for the terrestrial channel of the hybrid network. We have chosen this rate for the terrestrial channel rate as this is a popular, ITU-Tstandardized modem communication speed. For both channels, we assume additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is the principal channel impairment.

Reference-contexts: We present the results of this simulation in the next chapter. 3.1 ARQ Protocol The SR ARQ protocol operation was based on the core logic of the information transfer phase of the SREJ protocol specified in <ref> [6] </ref> with the multi-selective reject option specified in [7]. Modifications to these standards include: * Removal of all HDLC-related matters such as bit stuffing and channel-idle indications. * The standards specify protocols for two-way distribution of fresh information. <p> This allowed the removal of one of the two sequence number fields in the information-frame headers. * The poll/final bit was not implemented. Initiating and terminating information transfer was conducted by the simulation, external to the protocol. Additionally, the point-to-point protocol specifed in <ref> [6] </ref> and [7] was specially modified to accommodate multiple receivers.

Modifications to these standards include: * Removal of all HDLC-related matters such as bit stuffing and channel-idle indications. * The standards specify protocols for two-way distribution of fresh information. In the present implementation, only enough features to allow unidirectional distribution of fresh data were included. <p> This allowed the removal of one of the two sequence number fields in the information-frame headers. * The poll/final bit was not implemented.
