Abstract: Metapatterns (also known as metaqueries) have been proposed as a new approach to integrated data mining, and applied to several real-world applications successfully. However, designing the right metapatterns for a given application still remains a difficulty task. In this paper, we present a metapattern generator that can automatically generate metapatterns from new databases. By integrating this generator with the existing metapattern-based discovery loop, our system has now become both interactive and automatic. It can suggest new metapatterns for humans to choose and test, or pursue these metapatterns on its own. This ability not only makes the process of data mining more efficient and productive, but also provide a new method for unsupervised learning of relational patterns. We have applied this method to several simple databases and obtained some encouraging results.

Reference-contexts: Related Work The most relevant work to this research includes supervised learning of relation patterns (e.g., (Quinlan 1990; Muggleton & Feng 1990)) and applications of ILP to KDD (e.g., <ref> (Dzeroski 1995) </ref>). However, most of these approaches learn rules that are rigid logical statements with no allowance for uncertainty, and often assume databases are correct and noise-free. While the patterns discovered by our method have associated probabilities that allows uncertainties and noise.

Reference-contexts: By examing, selecting, and executing different metapatterns, human users can expand or contract the search space and change the search direction at will. For more detailed description of metapatterns, readers are encouraged to read (Shen et al. 1995) and <ref> (Shen & Leng 1996) </ref>. Although metapatterns are powerful tools for data mining and have been applied successfully to several real-world applications (Shen 1992; Shen et al. 1995; Fu & Han 1995), designing the right metapatterns for a given application is not an easy task.

Reference-contexts: Among all the general metapatterns, the transitivity metapattern (see MP-1 for example) is the most interesting. In essence, it subsumes many other types of metapatterns, such as implication, inheritance, transfers-through, and function dependency <ref> (Shen 1992) </ref>. In this section, we describe how transitivity meatpatterns are generated. How other types of metapatterns are generated based on transitivities will be described in the section after the next.
