Abstract: We provide an overview of a distributed-agent architecture design for the large-scale digital library environment currently under development at the University of Michigan. This paper presents some of the design principles and techniques underlying our approach, as well as some preliminary observations from our first steps in developing the system. One of the most interesting and technically challenging features of digital libraries is diversity|in users, in information sources, and in many other features. For example, user skills, information demands, and level of professional competence will vary greatly among users of digital libraries. Similarly, the collections will vary over many parameters, including breadth and depth of subject, medium, and format. We expect that diversity will continue to increase and even accelerate, especially as digital libraries facilitate the spread of the publishing function from traditional publishing organizations to individuals. Diversity in large-scale information systems is also manifest across time. The types of tasks users perform and the tools available for performing these tasks are constantly evolving. Because the technology is changing at such a rapid pace, we believe that it is inadvisable to provide an all-encompassing set of standards for both user interfaces and collections. Thus, we do not advocate standards for describing and performing tasks, such as standard query languages or search engines. Instead, we have chosen to concentrate on defining an architecture that performs task-management tasks (meta-tasks), such as allocating resources to user-requested tasks and brokering connections among collaborating system modules. For example, we define fl Authors alphabetical. We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of many others participating the UMDL project, especially Gene Alloway. This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation Digital Library Initiative. a language and protocol for communicating about informational or processing capabilities and interests, so that interfaces and collections can be brought together appropriately. At that point, however, what they do with that connection (how they interact to accomplish their task) is not a concern at the level of our architecture. The advantage of avoiding general standards regarding information storage, retrieval, representation, or processing is that it makes incremental growth of our system both possible and appealing to developers. It certainly does not preclude the creation of partial standards, which is in itself a worthy goal, but it does not rely on their universal adoption. In fact, a goal of our endeavor is to provide an infrastructure where new capabilities|abilities to provide a better user interface, search more efficiently, translate among languages or representations, and so on|can be incorporated easily and can participate in tasks for which they are especially well suited without having to overhaul the existing components. The challenge that we face, therefore, is to provide an infrastucture that supports interoperability among potentially widely diverse collections, user interfaces, and other information providing and processing components. In building the University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL) (Birmingham et al. 1994), our approach is to distribute information-retrieval tasks to highly specialized agents. Large numbers of fine-grained agents promote modularity, flexibility, and in-crementality of the system, and provide a framework for tackling the interoperability problems. As new services become technologically feasible (e.g., information filters), agents can be added to the architecture; similarly, as new bodies of information become available we can likewise create new agents to manage these collections.

Reference-contexts: Our protocols for agent interaction and negotiation call for agents to deal with each other as far as possible at the knowledge level|specifying goals to be achieved, for example, not the method to achieve them. In our initial specification and implementation, we are using KQML <ref> (Finin et al. 1994) </ref> with several extensions to the set of performatives. For example, to register a new collection, messages implementing the following are exchanged: 1. Each agent registers its IP address. 2. Advertise * CIAs advertise their conspectus. * The query planner advertises its capability.

Reference-contexts: To begin exploring some of the economic issues arising in the UMDL, we have developed a simple computational market model of a generic network-service distribution problem <ref> (Mullen & Wellman 1995) </ref>. The problem we posed involves a LAN (or WAN) which uses several network information products, such as weather or news services, that could be encapsulated as UMDL collections. One central resource allocation question involves locating and caching these service providers on the network.

Reference-contexts: Participation by third-party agents is to be encouraged, provided that the protocols impose sufficient restrictions on agents to prevent them from manipulating the environment in detrimental ways <ref> (Rosenschein & Zlotkin 1994) </ref>. 1 This is not to deny that reasoning about local completeness can be very useful for reasoning about the scope of queries.

Reference-contexts: To illustrate the sort of information that is contained in the conspectus, Table 1 presents a sample conspectus entry for the Blue-Skies collection, a weather information resource incorporated in the UMDL. As described in the entry, Blue-Skies is a service developed at the University of Michigan <ref> (Samson, Hay, & Fer-guson 1994) </ref> to provide a variety of basic weather information for K-12 education. The Blue-Skies service includes real-time interactive weather images, as well as various forms of archival data, images, and documents.

Reference-contexts: In particular, under what conditions is it worthwhile to establish one or more mirror sites for these products on the LAN? Where should they be? To answer this question, we elaborate on our previous work on computational economies for transportation services <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref>. Our initial model represents a simple network composed of one internet site and two local sites. We used Blue-Skies (see Table 1) as our information service product. In this example, Blue-Skies is produced on the internet, and local users access it frequently.

Reference-contexts: This wrapper performs two functions. First, it encapsulates user queries in the proper form for the UMDL protocols (see below). Second, it publishes a profile of the user, which is used by mediator agents to guide the search process. * Mediator agents <ref> (Wiederhold 1992) </ref>, of which there are many types, perform a variety of functions: essentially, all tasks that are required to refer a query from a UIA to a collection, monitor the progress of the query, transmit the results of a query, and perform all manner of translation and bookkeeping.
