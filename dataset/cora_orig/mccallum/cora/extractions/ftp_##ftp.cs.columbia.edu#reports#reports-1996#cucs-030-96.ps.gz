Reference-contexts: A June, 1994 article in Business Week <ref> [1] </ref> indicates the possible superiority of low discrepancy sequences. Details on the CMO, the numerical methods, and the test results are presented in [3]. Here we limit ourselves to stating our main conclusions and indicating typical results.

Reference-contexts: However, this time the average is taken over low discrepancy points. A number of low discrepancy point sets are known. Here we confine ourselves to Sobol or Halton points. Roughly speaking both have the property that the rate of convergence is proportional to (log n) d =n. See <ref> [2] </ref> for the theory of low discrepancy points and references to the literature. The n 1 factor in the convergence formula for low discrepancy points may be contrasted with the n 1=2 convergence of Monte Carlo and suggests that low discrepancy methods are sometimes superior to Monte Carlo methods.

Reference-contexts: A June, 1994 article in Business Week [1] indicates the possible superiority of low discrepancy sequences. Details on the CMO, the numerical methods, and the test results are presented in <ref> [3] </ref>. Here we limit ourselves to stating our main conclusions and indicating typical results. For brevity, we shall refer to the method which uses Sobol points as the Sobol method. We summarize our main conclusions regarding the evaluation of this CMO. The conclu sions may be divided into three groups. <p> The underlying pool of mortgages has a thirty-year maturity and cash flows are obtained monthly. This leads to 360 cash flows and hence to integration in 360 dimensions. The precise mathematical formulation for this CMO may be found in Section 5 of <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 Software System for Computing High Dimensional Integrals Theory suggests that the low discrepancy deterministic methods provide an interesting alternative to the Monte Carlo method for computing high dimensional integrals. We have developed and tested a distributed software system for computing multivariate integrals on 5 a network of workstations. <p> Hence, the Sobol run terminates 2 to 5 times faster than the Monte Carlo runs. We stress that even though the Sobol method terminates faster, it is often more accurate than the Monte Carlo method. Details may be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. 6 Antithetic Variables An important advantage of Monte Carlo and deterministic methods is that they can be utilized very generally. <p> Further results regarding antithetic variables may be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. 11 7 Small Number of Sample Points Results for a small number of points are sometimes of special importance for people who evaluate CMOs and other derivative products. They need methods which can evaluate a derivative in a matter of minutes. <p> Methodology and results are reported in Section 9 of <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since workstations are ubiquitous, this is a cost-effective way to do large computations fast. Of course, FINDER can also be used to compute high dimensional integrals on a single workstation. A routine for generating Sobol points is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. However, we incorporated major improvements in FINDER and we stress that the results reported in this paper were obtained using FINDER. One of the improvements was developing the table of primitive polynomials and initial direction numbers for dimensions up to 360. <p> The software is written in a modular way so other kinds of deterministic and random number generators can be easily added. One or several multivariate functions defined over the unit cube of up to 360 variables can be integrated simultaneously. A routine for generating Sobol points is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. However, we have made major improvements and we stress that the results reported in this paper were obtained using FINDER and not the routine in [4].

Throughout this section, we describe results on tranche A in more details. Results for other tranches are similar unless stated explicitly. The pseudorandom generator RAN2 from <ref> [4] </ref> is used to generate random sample points for the Monte Carlo runs. It is striking how typical this figure is of the vast amount of data we collected.

Reference-contexts: Vast sums are spent annually on these methods. Monte Carlo methods use random (or more precisely, pseudo-random) points. If we plot a moderate number of pseudo-random points in two dimensions, we observe regions where there are no points, see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>. Rather than using pseudo-random points, it seems attractive to choose points which are as uniformly distributed as possible. There is a notion in number theory called discrepancy which measures the deviation of a set of points in d dimensions from uniformity. <p> This paper is based on two years of software construction and testing. Preliminary results were presented to a number of New York City financial houses in the Fall of 1993 2 and the Spring of 1994. A January, 1994 article in Scientific American <ref> [5] </ref> discussed the theoretical issues and reported that "Preliminary results obtained by testing certain finance problems suggest the superiority of the deterministic methods in practice." Further results were reported at a number of conferences in the summer and fall of 1994.
