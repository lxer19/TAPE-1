Abstract: In this contribution we propose a new solution for the problem of blind separation of sources (for one dimensional signals and images) in the case that not only the waveform of sources is unknown, but also their number. For this purpose multi-layer neural networks with associated adaptive learning algorithms are developed. The primary source signals can have any non-Gaussian distribution, i.e. they can be sub-Gaussian and/or super-Gaussian. Computer experiments are presented which demonstrate the validity and high performance of the proposed approach.

Reference-contexts: The robust algorithm (2) possesses the uniformity or equivariance property [1, 4], but the simplified algorithm (1) does not have such property. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of separation, we could use a multilayer neural network <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.2 Determination of source number The output signals y j (t) contain some redundancy in the case when number of sources is smaller than number of sensors, i.e. some signals are repeated with different scale factors. In order to eliminate this redundancy we have applied one post-processing layer.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that the rule (5) is similar to the well-known Herault-Jutten rule <ref> [6] </ref>, but applied to a feed-forward network and with different activation functions. 3 COMPUTER SIMULATIONS RESULTS Performance and validity of the proposed approach has been confirmed by extensive computer simulation experiments.
