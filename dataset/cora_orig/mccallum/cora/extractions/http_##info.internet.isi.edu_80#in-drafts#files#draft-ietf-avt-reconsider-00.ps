Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress". Abstract RTP, the Real Time Transport Protocol, has gained widespread acceptance as the transport protocol for voice and video on the Internet. It provides services such as timestamping, sequence numbering, and payload identification. It also contains a control component, the Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP), which is used for loose session control, QoS reporting, and media synchronization, among other functions. The RTP specification describes an algorithm for determining the RTCP packet transmission rate at a host participating in a multicast RTP session. This algorithm was designed to allow RTP to be used in sessions with anywhere from one to a million members. However, we have discovered several problems with this algorithm when used with very large groups with rapidly changing group membership. One problem is the flood of RTCP packets which occurs when many users join a multicast RTP session at nearly the same time. To solve this problem, we present a novel adaptive timer algorithm called reconsideration. We present a mathematical analysis of this algorithm, and demonstrate that it performs extremely well, reducing the congestion problem by several orders of magnitude. We also back up these results with simulation. 1 Note that this paper has also been submitted to Infocom 98

Reference-contexts: The growing popularity of Internet telephony, streaming audio and video services (such as those provided by Real Audio) and the Mbone are all indicators of this trend. To support these applications, standards are being developed to insure interoperability. The ITU-T H.323 <ref> [1] </ref> specification for Internet telephony is gaining widespread acceptance among software vendors. The IETF is developing protocols such as SIP [2] for multimedia session initiation, and RTSP [3] for controlling multimedia servers on the Internet. Interwoven with all of the above protocols is the Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [4].

Reference-contexts: One RTCP packet type, the Source Descriptor (SDES) contains the name, email address, telephone number, fax, and location of the participant. Another, the receiver report, contains reception quality reporting. This information can be used by senders to adapt their transmission rates or encodings dynamically during a session <ref> [5] </ref>. It can also be used by network administrators to monitor network quality [6]. It could potentially be used by receivers to decide which multicast groups to join in a layered multimedia session; such an application is similar to RLM [7].

Reference-contexts: It can also be used by network administrators to monitor network quality [6]. It could potentially be used by receivers to decide which multicast groups to join in a layered multimedia session; such an application is similar to RLM <ref> [7] </ref>. Yet another RTCP packet type, the sender report (SR), is used to aid receivers in inter-media synchronization (lip sync), and to indicate transmitted bit rates, among other functions. Since RTP was designed for multicast, it was engineered to work well with both large and small sessions.

Reference-contexts: A typical "small" session might be a teleconference among five business executives, while a typical "large" session might be an Mbone broadcast of a shuttle launch, where group sizes of two hundred listeners have been reported <ref> [8] </ref>. As the demand for multimedia continues to grow, larger and larger group sizes will become commonplace. It is not difficult to envision Mbone concert broadcasts with thousands of members.

Reference-contexts: We have identified three inter-related problems which arise with large, dynamic multicast groups: * Congestion: In many cases, the access bandwidths for users will be small compared to network bandwidths (28.8 kb/s modems, for example, can now handle multimedia RTP sessions when RTP header compression <ref> [9] </ref> is used). We also anticipate that many multicast RTP sessions will exhibit rapid increases in group membership at certain points in time. This can happen for a number of reasons. Many sessions have precise start times.

Reference-contexts: It is our aim to solve this problem with a single mechanism, applicable to large groups and small alike. It is possible to develop solutions which work well for specific applications. For example, RTCP reporting can be disabled completely <ref> [11] </ref>. This, in fact, solves all three of the above problems. However, many applications require RTCP, and therefore this approach is not a general one. Another alternative is to use hierarchical summarizers. This helps improve convergence time, and may relieve congestion, but it requires special servers to be deployed.

Reference-contexts: It is also not appropriate for small groups, and therefore does not work well as a universal solution to the congestion problem.

Sharma et. al. consider how to scale soft state timers to varying link capacities and state quantities. Their work considers only the point to point case.

In fact, our algorithm for controlling the congestion problem in RTP is applicable to other protocols and systems.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is generally applicable to distributed systems where (1) control of bandwidth is desirable, (2) the bandwidth is used to transmit state, (3) the state is used to determine end system transmission rates, and (4) the state is dynamic. These constraints apply to BGP <ref> [16] </ref>, for example, when a route server is used and update rates are to be controlled. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we detail the current RTCP packet transmission algorithm. Section 3 describes the desired ideal behavior.

Reference-contexts: We assume upstream links are infinitely fast, since congestion occurs only downstream. This congestion is due to the RTCP reports from all of the other users being sent to any particular user. Multicast join latencies are ignored; this is reasonable in protocols such as DVMRP <ref> [17] </ref> since initial packets are flooded. We assume that the network introduces a delay of D seconds, where D is uniformly distributed between 0 and 600 ms. Each user has a 100 kB buffer on the downstream access link.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we investigated the impact of reconsideration on synchronization. The problem of synchronization in the Internet was studied by Van Jacobson and Sally Floyd in <ref> [18] </ref>. Their study focused on the synchronization of periodic routing messages, such as those generated by RIP or IGRP. However, they generalize their results to any system which is characterized by their periodic messages model.
