Reference-contexts: This requires only some modifications of the derivation of (1.1) as given in [5]. For that, we counted the cubic graphs which possess a prescribed Hamilton cycle (the number is asymptotic to (2n)!=(n!2 n e) by the result of Bender and Canfield <ref> [1, Theorem 1] </ref> or by an elementary argument using inclusion-exclusion), multiplied by the number of possible Hamilton cycles ((2n)!=4n), and divided by M .

Reference-contexts: This bound was improved in [5] to 2 3e 13=12 , using computations in the space of all triangle-free cubic graphs. The aim of that exercise was to get as close as possible to showing the following result, whose truth has been suspected for some time (see also Frieze <ref> [3] </ref>), and is finally demonstrated in the present paper.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It was first proved by Read <ref> [4] </ref> that the number M of labelled cubic graphs on 2n vertices is asymptotically M ~ e 2 (3n)!3 2n 2 5n ; where, throughout this paper, asymptotics are for n ! 1, unless otherwise specified.

Reference-contexts: Turn this set of graphs into a probability space = n with the uniform distribution. The authors showed in an earlier paper <ref> [5, Theorem 2.4] </ref> that the expectation and variance of the number H of Hamilton cycles of a graph G 2 are given asymptotically by ExpH ~ e p 3 ; (1:1) VarH ~ e (ExpH) 2 : (1:2) From this, it can be deduced using the standard second moment method that <p> This bound was improved in <ref> [5] </ref> to 2 3e 13=12 , using computations in the space of all triangle-free cubic graphs. <p> a consequence of this, after showing that the group means are sufficiently well behaved, it is deduced that Pr (H = 0) is bounded above asymptotically by *(b), where lim *(b) = 0: An alternative way of bounding the group variances is to compute them directly using the techniques in <ref> [5] </ref> combined with those in the proof of Lemma 2 of the present paper, but this would appear to be rather more complicated. Note that since X i plays no role when i is even, this gives a broader perspective to the improvement obtained in [5] by considering triangle-free graphs. <p> directly using the techniques in <ref> [5] </ref> combined with those in the proof of Lemma 2 of the present paper, but this would appear to be rather more complicated. Note that since X i plays no role when i is even, this gives a broader perspective to the improvement obtained in [5] by considering triangle-free graphs. In addition it provides an intuitive basis for the fact also proved in [5] that V arH = o ((ExpH) 2 ) among labelled bipartite cubic graphs, from which it follows at once that almost all are hamiltonian. <p> Note that since X i plays no role when i is even, this gives a broader perspective to the improvement obtained in <ref> [5] </ref> by considering triangle-free graphs. In addition it provides an intuitive basis for the fact also proved in [5] that V arH = o ((ExpH) 2 ) among labelled bipartite cubic graphs, from which it follows at once that almost all are hamiltonian. Using techniques related to those of the present paper it can be shown that almost all k-regular graphs are hamiltonian, for any fixed k 3. <p> We first show that Exp (HX m ) ~ -m ExpH (2:6) where -m = 2 m1 =m if m is even i i if m is odd, m = 2i + 1. This requires only some modifications of the derivation of (1.1) as given in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> We classify C according to labels of the edges of C which are not contained in D. By Lemma 2.1 of <ref> [5] </ref>, there are exactly m s 1 possible choices of s non-adjacent edges from an m-cycle, and hence this is the number of choices for the labels of the edges of C not in D. So suppose that these labels have been chosen.
