Abstract: VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale rate variability. A number of researchers have considered transmitting stored video from a server to a client using smoothing algorithms to reduce this rate variability. These algorithms exploit client buffering capabilities and determine a smooth rate transmission schedule, while ensuring that a client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. In this paper, we investigate how video smoothing impacts the statistical multiplexing gains available with such traffic and show that a significant amount of statistical multiplexing gains can still be achieved. We then examine the implication of these results on network resource management and call admission control when transmitting smoothed stored video using variable-bit-rate (VBR) service with statistical Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. Specifically, we present a call admission control scheme based on a Chernoff bound method that uses a simple, novel traffic model requiring only a few parameters. This scheme provides an easy and flexible mechanism for supporting multiple VBR service classes with different QoS requirements. We evaluate the efficacy of the call admission control scheme over a set of MPEG-1 coded video traces.

Reference-contexts: Video, which is typically stored and transmitted in compressed format, can exhibit significant rate variability, often spanning multiple time scales and in some cases demonstrating self-similar behavior <ref> [7] </ref>. The highly bursty nature of VBR-compressed, constant-quality video makes network call admission control and resource management a particularly difficult and complicated task. <p> Because it optimally reduces rate variability, we use this algorithm as the video smoothing technique throughout the paper.

Reference-contexts: By applying video smoothing techniques to real-time video transmission, the peak rate and rate variability of the smoothed video stream can be significantly reduced, thus improving the network utilization under CBR service <ref> [8, 22, 27] </ref>. However, a completely constant-bit-rate video stream may require an extremely large client buffer and long start-up latency [18]. With relatively small client buffers (say, in the range of 64 KB to 1 MB), smoothed video streams continue to exhibit long-term, slow-time rate variability. <p> The call admission control scheme is based on the well-known Chernoff-bound method <ref> [5, 8, 9, 23] </ref>.

Recently, several new network services have been proposed which rely on the implicit exploitation of statistical multiplexing gain by adding a renegotiation feature to CBR service <ref> [8] </ref>, and to VBR service with deterministic QoS guarantees [30].

Reference-contexts: In general, the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off depends on the characteristics of source traffic and is an interesting subject worth further study (see <ref> [15] </ref> for results along this line in the context of leaky-bucket regulated sources). Two advantages are realized with minimal buffer allocation in the network. First, queueing delay jitter within the network is greatly reduced, implying that less client buffer space is needed to accommodate it.

Reference-contexts: In [27], a smoothing algorithm is presented that achieves the maximal reduction in rate variability for stored video, producing the smoothest possible server transmission schedule. The intuitive notion of smoothness is formalized using the concept of majorization <ref> [16] </ref>, and the optimality of the smoothing algorithm is formally established. Among other things, the optimal smoothing algorithm in [27] produces a transmission schedule that has both minimal peak rate and variance for a given client buffer size.

In <ref> [21, 22] </ref>, video smoothing using client decoder buffer together with a startup delay is studied in an on-line video conferencing setting, and the shortest Euclidean distance algorithm of [13] is used to produce smoothed server transmission schedules under the assumption that the frame sizes of the video conference trace are known <p> A histogram-based call admission control scheme is proposed in [29], and the loss probability of the aggregate traffic at a network switch is computed using convolution, incurring formidable computational costs when the number of sources is large. In <ref> [22] </ref>, the issue of statistical multiplexing gain is briefly studied using a simple two-parameter model and a call admission control scheme that uses the binomial distribution to estimate loss probability. When the number of sources is large, the computation of the binomial distribution becomes very cumbersome.

Reference-contexts: The call admission control scheme is based on the well-known Chernoff-bound method <ref> [5, 8, 9, 23] </ref>. Our contribution lies in the traffic model used in the scheme. We propose a parsimonious bounding model approach that uses only a few generic parameters to characterize the marginal distribution of video streams.

Reference-contexts: These drastically altered marginal distributions of smoothed video streams have important consequences for traffic modeling. For example, the traffic modeling techniques presented in <ref> [7, 12, 24] </ref> that characterize the heavy-tailed marginal distributions are not applicable to the smoothed video traces. Neither is the DAR (1) traffic model in [5] which assumes that the marginal distribution can be approximated by a negative geometrical distribution. Clearly, different techniques are needed for modeling smoothed video traces. <p> Hence, VBR service may be likewise employed for such video streams without requiring any explicit renegotiation. 23 Several methods have been used in characterizing the heavy-tailed marginal distribution of unsmoothed video traces (see, e.g., <ref> [7, 12, 24] </ref>), where a known distribution, such as Gamma, Pareto, or Lognormal, is used to approximate the marginal distribution in order to obtain a parsimonious characterization. <p> Acknowledgments We would like to thank the researchers who generously shared their MPEG video traces.

Reference-contexts: From the client's perspective, this also means reduced latency in playback. Second, minimal buffering in the network limits the effect of the autocorrelation structure of the user's traffic on the overall average loss rate <ref> [26] </ref>. Hence, the difficult task of characterizing the correlation structure of the user traffic is much less important.

These algorithms exploit client buffering capabilities to determine a smooth rate transmission schedule, while ensuring that the client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. Such techniques can achieve significant reduction in rate variability. <p> These algorithms exploit client buffering capabilities to determine a smooth rate transmission schedule, while ensuring that the client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. Such techniques can achieve significant reduction in rate variability. For example, over a set of MPEG-1 coded video traces, the smoothing technique in <ref> [27] </ref> is shown to reduce the peak and standard deviation of the transmitted bit rate by approximately 70%-85%, when smoothed into a 1 MB client buffer. These results demonstrate that video smoothing is a powerful technique that will likely be deployed for real-time transport of VBR-compressed stored video. <p> By applying video smoothing techniques to real-time video transmission, the peak rate and rate variability of the smoothed video stream can be significantly reduced, thus improving the network utilization under CBR service <ref> [8, 22, 27] </ref>. However, a completely constant-bit-rate video stream may require an extremely large client buffer and long start-up latency [18]. With relatively small client buffers (say, in the range of 64 KB to 1 MB), smoothed video streams continue to exhibit long-term, slow-time rate variability. <p> Data arriving ahead of its playback time is stored in a client buffer. In order to ensure continuous playback at the client, the server must transmit the video stream in a manner that ensures that the client buffer neither underflows nor overflows. Various video smoothing algorithms have been developed <ref> [6, 17, 18, 21, 22, 27] </ref> that exploit client buffering capabilities to reduce the rate variability existing in VBR compressed video, while ensuring that the client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. <p> In <ref> [27] </ref>, a smoothing algorithm is presented that achieves the maximal reduction in rate variability for stored video, producing the smoothest possible server transmission schedule. The intuitive notion of smoothness is formalized using the concept of majorization [16], and the optimality of the smoothing algorithm is formally established. <p> The intuitive notion of smoothness is formalized using the concept of majorization [16], and the optimality of the smoothing algorithm is formally established. Among other things, the optimal smoothing algorithm in <ref> [27] </ref> produces a transmission schedule that has both minimal peak rate and variance for a given client buffer size. Because it optimally reduces rate variability, we use this algorithm as the video smoothing technique throughout the paper. <p> In the rest of the paper, we will refer to the smoothed transmission schedule of a video trace as the smoothed trace. It is a sequence of transmission sizes produced by the optimal smoothing algorithm of <ref> [27] </ref>. Note that implicit in our study of video smoothing techniques is the assumption that the server transmits ATM cells within a frame (or a transmission size) periodically using the intra-frame deterministic smoothing method [28].

Reference-contexts: The focus of the remainder of the paper is thus on the marginal distribution characterization. In Section 4.2, we look at a standard method for characterizing the marginal distribution the histogram method <ref> [29] </ref>. Under this method, by increasing the number of bins used to describe the histogram, a more accurate bandwidth estimation can be obtained using the Chernoff-bound method. However, this better performance is achieved by incurring greater network overhead. <p> Our experience shows that DAR (1) is not appropriate for both smoothed and unsmoothed MPEG compressed video streams because of the long-range dependence exhibited by the traces. A histogram-based call admission control scheme is proposed in <ref> [29] </ref>, and the loss probability of the aggregate traffic at a network switch is computed using convolution, incurring formidable computational costs when the number of sources is large.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the Chernoff bound provides a very good estimate. Recently, several new network services have been proposed which rely on the implicit exploitation of statistical multiplexing gain by adding a renegotiation feature to CBR service [8], and to VBR service with deterministic QoS guarantees <ref> [30] </ref>. In [8], the entire rate change profile of a renegotiated CBR (RCBR) stream is characterized by a Markovian model and the Chernoff bound method is used for call admission control to limit the probability of service failure.

In [5], a combination of effective bandwidths and the Chernoff bound (called the Chernoff-Dominant Eigenvalue method) is proposed for call admission control at a network multiplexer with shared buffers. The method is evaluated using video-conferencing traces.
