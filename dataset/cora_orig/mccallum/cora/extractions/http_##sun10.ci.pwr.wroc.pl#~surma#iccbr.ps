Abstract: The recent progress in Case Based Reasoning has shown that one of the most important challenges in developing future AI methods will be to combine and synergistically utilize general and case-based knowledge. In this paper a very rudimentary kind of integration for the classification task, based on simple heuristics, is sketched: "To solve a problem, first try to use the conventional rule-based approach. If it does not work, try to remember a similar problem you have solved in the past and adapt the old solution to the new situation". This heuristic approach is based on the knowledge base that consists of rule base and exception case base. The method of generating this kind of knowledge base from a set of examples is described. The proposed approach is tested, and compared with alternative approaches. The experimental results show that the presented integration method can lead to an improvement in accuracy and comprehensibility.

Reference-contexts: A good example of combined reasoning in the framework for problem solving in knowledge rich environment is the CREEK system <ref> (Aamodt 1991) </ref>. Here, the system first attempts to solve the problem by case based reasoning, and if an acceptable match is not found, rule based reasoning is attempted. The selected studies in inductive learning were based on an integration with the case-based approach.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The recent progress in Case Based Reasoning has shown that one of the most important challenges in developing future AI methods will be to combine and synergistically utilize general and case based knowledge <ref> (Aamodt 1995) </ref>. The presented approach has an origin in Riesbeck and Schank's psychological consideration (Riesbeck & Schank 1989, pp.11): " When an activity has been repeated often enough it becomes rule like in nature.

Reference-contexts: This kind of method for identifying exceptional cases was introduced in Salzberg and Cost MVDM metric (Cost & Salzberg 1993). We take into consideration two very simple heuristic split approaches. The first one assumes that nontypical cases can be interpreted as near-boundary cases. Aha's study on the IB2 algorithm <ref> (Aha 1992) </ref> shows that misclassified cases are more likely to be near-boundary, so in this heuristic correctly classified cases are put into the Standard_Case_Base, and incorrectly classified cases into the Exception_Case_Base. The second approach is more sophisticated, and is based on Zhang's formalization of the family resemblance idea (Zhang 1992).

Reference-contexts: Armengol and Plaza presented the general knowledge modelling framework for solving the purification task of proteins. This task can be solved in different ways, especially by combining case based retrieval and by using domain knowledge in the form of prototypes that are generated by an inductive method <ref> (Armengol & Plaza 1994) </ref>. The four possible levels of integration between the Induction and Case Based Reasoning method were established and tested in the INRECA project (Manago et al., 1993), (Auriol et al., 1994).

Reference-contexts: The four possible levels of integration between the Induction and Case Based Reasoning method were established and tested in the INRECA project (Manago et al., 1993), <ref> (Auriol et al., 1994) </ref>. In terms of stand alone, cooperative, workbench and seamless levels of integration, the approach presented in this paper is cooperative. This means that both methods are kept separated but they cooperate.

Reference-contexts: The split can be based on weighting schemes as well, where exceptional cases can be determined to their performance and/or frequency of use for problem solving. This kind of method for identifying exceptional cases was introduced in Salzberg and Cost MVDM metric <ref> (Cost & Salzberg 1993) </ref>.

First, the knowledge acquisition process for obtaining Exception_Case_Base and Rule_Base is relatively easy.
