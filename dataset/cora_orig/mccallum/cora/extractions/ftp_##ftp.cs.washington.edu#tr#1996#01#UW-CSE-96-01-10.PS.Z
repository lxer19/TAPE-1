Abstract: and caching data from parallel disks, as a technique for enabling serial applications to improve I/O performance. [16, 30, 32, 41, 51, 42]. We consider algorithms for integrated prefetching and caching in a model with a fixed-size cache and any number of backing storage devices (which we will call disks). The integration of caching and prefetching with a single disk was previously considered by Cao et al. [8]. We show that the natural extension of their aggressive algorithm to the parallel disk case is suboptimal by a factor of (nearly) the number of disks in the worst case. Our main result is
