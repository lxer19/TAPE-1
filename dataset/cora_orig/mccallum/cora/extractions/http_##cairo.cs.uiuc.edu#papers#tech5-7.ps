Reference-contexts: An alternative [BZ93] protocol is to establish multiple paths during the connection setup and however only use the best path to transmit data, which involves dynamical rerouting among those paths. Routing and rerouting decisions are made based on a combined heuristics of the shortest path and path utilization. In <ref> [ABB96] </ref>, formal methods are exploited for QoS analysis, aiming at providing provable quality of service. The techniques presented are suitable only for specifying small-scale algorithms.

Reference-contexts: drops, more CPU time can be reserved at the destination computer and the gateway between subnets 1 and 2 so that compression algorithms can be used to reduce the actual data rate going through subnet 2. 3.5 Related work Our scheduler for a non-reservable resource is different from Anderson's metascheduler <ref> [And93] </ref>. The metascheduler is used to coordinate multiple system components CPU, networks, file systems, 41 etc.) and negotiate end-to-end guarantees on behalf of clients. It is resource-reservation-based.

Reference-contexts: A soft QoS guarantee is achieved as long as the 42 aggregate bandwidth of all the paths for the connection is not less than the required bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: The transition algorithm ensures that the transition from the previous to the new channel does not violate the client's modification contract. The routing algorithm determines a route which has the highest probability of successful connection establishment. A dynamic end-to-end multi-path protocol is proposed in <ref> [CN97] </ref> for high-speed networks which supports variable bit rate traffic with soft bandwidth guarantee. During the setup phase of a connection, multiple paths with minimal number of shared links from the source to the destination are established.

Reference-contexts: During the last decade, a considerable amount of research has been done in the area of QoS provision and adaptation. We present several achievements of this area to show the state of the art. Parris and Ferrari presented a Dynamic Connection Management scheme (DCM) in <ref> [PF93] </ref>. The purpose of DCM is two-folded. It allows the client to change their requirements on the fly and adapts the communication services to meet the increased requirements; it allows the network to initiate adaptation by redistributing resources among clients in order to achieve better overall resource utilization.

Reference-contexts: The techniques presented are suitable only for specifying small-scale algorithms. It is still not clear how to apply them on generic QoS architectures that provide services at different system layers to applications with very diverse QoS requirements. An adaptive synchronization scheme is presented in <ref> [QN97] </ref> which integrates adaptive services and synchronization protocols to provide lip synchronization for video on demand in a best-effort environment.

Reference-contexts: The acceptance test of sporadic jobs is a difficult problem. Most existing acceptance test algorithms for sporadic jobs are based on slack stealing. The algorithms based on static slack computation can only work well in a system where the release time jitters of all periodic jobs are negligibly small <ref> [Tia95] </ref>, namely, the interrelease time of any two consecutive jobs must be strictly a constant. The algorithms based on dynamical slack stealing algorithm has either high runtime overhead or inaccurate slack computation. We want to design a new algorithm which achieves the following goals. 1. <p> The tested job is accepted if the slack of every such job is equal to or larger than zero. For the systems where the release time jitters of periodic tasks are small, an optimal static slack computation algorithm that has a linear-time complexity was proposed by Tia <ref> [Tia95] </ref>. Some 19 acceptance test algorithms were proposed based on the static slack computation [Tia95]. <p> For the systems where the release time jitters of periodic tasks are small, an optimal static slack computation algorithm that has a linear-time complexity was proposed by Tia <ref> [Tia95] </ref>. Some 19 acceptance test algorithms were proposed based on the static slack computation [Tia95]. <p> Our acceptance test algorithm has a time complexity of O (m) and a space complexity of O (m), which are much better than the slack-stealing-based algorithms, and the release time jitters of periodic tasks can be arbitrary. The acceptance test algorithm based on the static slack computation proposed in <ref> [Tia95] </ref> is optimal in the sense that the algorithm accepts a sporadic job if any other algorithm can accept the job. 3 Our algorithm, however, is not optimal though it adopts a greedy acceptance strategy. 3 The acceptance of a job implies that the job will meet its deadline. 20 Chapter

Reference-contexts: Soft real-time guarantee is discussed in Section 2.8. We borrow the idea of virtual clock <ref> [Zha91] </ref> which was originally used to schedule periodical job sequences (statistical data packet flows with bounded average transmission rates) and apply it to sporadic jobs, which results in an acceptance test algorithm based on a new concept of virtual deadline.
