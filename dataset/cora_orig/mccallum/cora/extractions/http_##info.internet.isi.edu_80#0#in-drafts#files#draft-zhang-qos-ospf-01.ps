Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as work in progress. Abstract This document describes a series of extensions for OSPF[1] and MOSPF[2] that can be used to provide Quality of Service (QoS) routing in conjunction with a resource reservation protocol such as RSVP[4] or other mechanisms that can notify routing of the QoS needs of a data flow. Advertisements indicating the resources available and the resources used are advertised to the OSPF routing domain and paths are computed based on topology information, link resource information, and the resource requirements of a particular data flow. QoS signalling protocols such as RSVP allow the instantiation of network state to provide a specific service level to a data flow. RSVP is specifically not a routing protocol but it does have interfaces to routing in order to determine the forwarding of its own state messages. Existing routing protocols are usually concerned only with topology information and not network resources such as bandwidth, thus they all have their limitations in providing integrated services.

Reference-contexts: Another type of advertisement, Deterministic Area Border Router Advertisements (DABRA), are needed for inter-area multicast QOSPF. There are a lot of ways to represent network resource information. In this document, we use Token Bucket parameters, as in the Controlled-Load Service model <ref> [5] </ref>. It is expected that resource advertisements that are related to other service models could be added over time. The number of RRAs can easily get huge as the number of reserved flows and network size grow, presenting a scaling issue. <p> The V-bit, E-bit, B-bit, #Links, Link type, Link ID and Link data are the same as in a Router LSA. The available link resource is represented by token bucket parameters, in IEEE single precision floating point format, as in the Controlled-Load Service model <ref> [5] </ref>. The link delay is a static delay metric for the link, in units of milliseconds. The RES-LSA could be combined with regular Router-LSA because the delay and resource information could be encoded as special TOS metrics in Router-LSAs. <p> The reserved bandwidth resource is represented by token bucket parameters, in IEEE single precision floating point format, as in the Controlled-Load Service model <ref> [5] </ref>. The reservation information comes from a resource reservation protocol, such as RSVP or some other mechanism for reserving resources on the node. Whenever a reservation is made or canceled, QOSPF will originate a new instance of the RRA for the flow.
