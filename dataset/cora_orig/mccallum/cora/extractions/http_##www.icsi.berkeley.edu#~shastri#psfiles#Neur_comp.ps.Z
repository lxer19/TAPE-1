Abstract: Any intelligent system, whether human or robotic, must be capable of dealing with patterns over time. Temporal pattern processing can be achieved if the system has a short-term memory capacity (STM) so that different representations can be maintained for some time. In this work we propose a neural model wherein STM is realized by leaky integrators in a self-organizing system. The model exhibits compositionality, that is, it has the ability to extract and construct progressively complex and structured associations in an hierarchical manner, starting with basic and primitive (temporal) elements. An important feature of the proposed model is the use of temporal correlations to express dynamic bindings.

Reference-contexts: Recent neurological data highlights the potential role of the temporal structure of neural activity in the expression and propagation of dynamic bindings (Singer, 1993), <ref> (Abeles, 1991) </ref>. A particularly promising hypothesis is that all information pertaining to a single entity is bound together as a result of the synchronous firing of the various nodes encoding information about this entity (von der Malsburg, 1986), (Sejnowski, 1981), (Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1993).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many cognitive processes must be compositional, that is, they must be capable of extracting and constructing progressively complex and structured representations in a hierarchical manner, starting with simple primitive elements <ref> (Bienenstock, May 1995) </ref>. For example, visual recognition of complex objects and events requires the rapid assembly of diverse information about the subcomponents of the object or event. <p> Thus compositionality, binding, and temporal pattern processing are interrelated and seem to play an essential role in cognition <ref> (Bienenstock, May 1995) </ref>. In this work, compositionality is achieved by a hierarchical model of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and the temporal processing ability is achieved by exploiting neurons capable of supporting short-term memory (STM).

Reference-contexts: It is worth highlighting that, the previous equation is a sum of radial basis function and it can be also proved that is a solution of the regularization problem <ref> (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) </ref>. We use an extended form of SOM that exhibits the necessary STM property so that, different temporal components over a window of time can be processed. Unlike SOM, the extended model, D-SOM, uses a dynamic version of a classical neuron model.

Reference-contexts: Thus one can view each element as a recognizer of a complex event. In view of the above, each element is composed of a set of sub-elements | classically called taps <ref> (Privitera and Morasso, 1994) </ref> | each of which represents different critical points in the temporal evolution of the input vector. Specifically, if an element recognizes an event composed of m temporal features, it consists of m distinct taps (see Figure 2). <p> The learning of tap weights can be done in a traditional Hebbian manner exploiting a unique vector 2 &lt; Kfim for each iteration. In <ref> (Privitera and Morasso, 1994) </ref> an alternative learning method has been presented where the taps are learned in real time using a sequence of input vectors.

Reference-contexts: The temporal property of D-SOM can be exploited in the context of motor control and time series analysis (see for example <ref> (Plamondon and Privitera, 1996) </ref>). <p> This task involves three levels of representation: the position of the two points in the visual scene at time t, the relationship between the local trajectories of the two points at the same time and the evolution of this relationship over time. Consequently, three D-SOM levels are defined (see <ref> (Privitera and Shastri, 1996) </ref>). 10 the map consists of to a 10 fi 10 grid of elements. Each element is composed of four distinct taps, each representing a particular combination of the two input trajectories.

Reference-contexts: Thus the membrane potential of an element is correlated with the temporal evolution of its input and the element can not only analyze a static input vector *, it can also perform a temporal integration of the function u i (*(t)) (hence the name, Leaky Integrator element (see for example <ref> (Reiss and Taylor, 1991) </ref>)). If this temporal integration depends on the occurrence of certain spatio-temporal features/sub-events in the evolving tem 5 poral input, then the activation of the element indicates the occurrence of an external event composed of these sub-events.

All the elements of the map are continually compared with the current value of the common threshold function.
