Reference-contexts: Partial differential equations are often favorable because they offer cost-effective solutions for three-dimensional problems. Integral equations have their own advantages; for example, air regions can be excluded, and the exterior boundary condition (i.e., that the magnetic field vanishes in infinity) is satisfied automatically (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]). Moreover, in linear problems, boundary integral equations give often a reasonably accurate solution with a relative small number of unknowns.

During the past twenty years PDEs have dominated research in the field of numerical computation of low-frequency electromagnetic fields, and they have almost overwhelmed the developments in integral formulations.

Reference-contexts: Probably one of the main reasons that integral equations have not attracted researchers as much as PDEs is the dense integral equation matrix. It is well known that iterative solvers such as ICCG (incomplete Choleski factorization, conjugate gradient) are effective in solving a sparse systems of equations <ref> [3] </ref>. On the other hand, it is not clear how a full system of equations should be effectively solved to avoid a total execution count of O (n 3 ) with direct methods like LU factorization. PDEs do not lead to the same problem.

Reference-contexts: Our final goal is time-dependent problems; hence, 2 we have developed and implemented an h-type formulation, which can be generalized to low-frequency eddy current problems with magnetic materials. BACKGROUND One of the first volume integral equation approaches for nonlinear magnetostatics was the GFUN code, developed in early 1970s <ref> [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] </ref>. GFUN is based on a piecewise constant vector approximation of magnetic field strength H inside elements. Components of H are solved independently within each element; this approach implies that H does not have any kind of continuity between neighboring elements.

Components of H are solved independently within each element; this approach implies that H does not have any kind of continuity between neighboring elements. <p> This means that in refining the mesh, the solution time of the integral equation system increases rapidly. In addition, if susceptibility is large enough, the system matrix becomes illconditioned and causes a "looping pattern" <ref> [8] </ref> in the H-field. Results in air are still reasonable, but the H-field within magnetic parts is useless. A dense system matrix is inherent to integral equations and thus unavoidable, but the size of the matrix can be dramatically decreased by approximating field variables in standard finite element spaces.

Reference-contexts: Depending on which simplex the degrees of freedom are related to, these elements are often called nodal, edge, facet, or volume elements.

From a practical point of view, there is a problem in selecting an independent set of degrees of freedom. This problem was indirectly solved by Albanese and Rubinacci <ref> [18, 19] </ref>. They implied a "two-component gauge" [21] T u = 0 (7) for vector potential T by forming a co-tree from the graph of all edges in the mesh and disregarding the degrees of freedom associated with the tree edges.

Reference-contexts: If more cycles are needed, each processor 11 updates susceptibility data and its block of the matrix. TEST RESULTS AND APPLICATIONS In this section we give results demonstrating characteristics of the integral formulations. The first two examples are the international TEAM benchmark problems number 13 and 20 <ref> [31] </ref>, [32]. The third example is a positron accumulator ring dipole magnet of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory. For the first two examples, measured data is available. <p> All the sequential results are computed on a DEC Alpha 3000-600 AXP and the parallel results on an IBM SP1 with RS/6000 model 370 processors. TEAM Problem 13 TEAM problem 13 consists of thin steel plates, which are excited below the saturation level (Fig. ) <ref> [31] </ref>. One of the main difficulties in the problem is a narrow air gap between the steel plates. The groups who have solved the problem agree that a high number of elements is required in order to achieve accurate results below the saturation level [34].

TEST RESULTS AND APPLICATIONS In this section we give results demonstrating characteristics of the integral formulations. The first two examples are the international TEAM benchmark problems number 13 and 20 [31], <ref> [32] </ref>. The third example is a positron accumulator ring dipole magnet of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory. For the first two examples, measured data is available. <p> Therefore, in both cases, one has to solve a dense system of equations. TEAM Problem 20 TEAM problem 20 (Fig. 6) offers a good test example for studying the accuracy of force calculations, because measured data is available <ref> [32] </ref>. As in problem 13, problem 20 includes narrow air gaps between two separate pieces of steel. The air gaps cause some difficulties in computing the force between the distinct parts, if integral equations are used.

Reference-contexts: The third example is a positron accumulator ring dipole magnet of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory. For the first two examples, measured data is available. The results of the integral formulation of the last problem are compared with the solution computed by TOSCA <ref> [33] </ref>, which is a commercial FEM software for nonlinear 3D magnetostatics. The applications were chosen such that they also demonstrate the difficulties we have experienced. In addition, in the results shown in this paper no particular attempt has been made to minimize the computing time. <p> The solution time was 7,896 seconds on a DEC Alpha 3000-600 AXP. The larger mesh contained 7,537 nodes and 34,645 elements; the solution time was 7,028 seconds on an IBM SP1 with 64 processors. Results of the integral formulation are compared with results computed with TOSCA <ref> [33] </ref> using a very large number of elements and nodes. The end fields of the dipole along an arc in the center of the beam chamber computed with GFUNET and TOSCA are plotted in Figure 10. Here, the solid line is the result computed with TOSCA.

Reference-contexts: One of the main difficulties in the problem is a narrow air gap between the steel plates. The groups who have solved the problem agree that a high number of elements is required in order to achieve accurate results below the saturation level <ref> [34] </ref>. We have conducted many experiments with problem 13 and found that, even with a small number of elements, results are not unreasonable. This seems to be a characteristic feature of the h-type integral formulation.

Reference-contexts: drawback of this approach is the time-consuming analytic integration of B. (This efficiency of force computations could be further improved by combining numerical and analytic integration.) The forces computed with the sequential version are compared with the measured data in Table 2. (The reproducibility of the measurements is 4 % <ref> [35] </ref>.) The accuracy of the computed forces of case 1 is noteworthy.
