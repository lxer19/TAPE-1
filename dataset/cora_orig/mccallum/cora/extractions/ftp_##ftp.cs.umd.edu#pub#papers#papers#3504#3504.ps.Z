Abstract: Traditional control systems have been designed to exercise control at regularly spaced time instants. When a discrete version of the system dynamics is used, a constant sampling interval is assumed and a new control value is calculated and exercised at each time instant. In this paper we formulate a new control scheme, temporal control, in which we not only calculate the control value but also decide the time instants when the new values are to be used. Taking a discrete, linear, time-invariant system, and a cost function which reflects a cost for computation of the control values, as an example, we show the feasibility of using this scheme. We formulate the temporal control scheme as a feedback scheme and, through a numerical example, demonstrate the significant reduction in cost through the use of temporal control. fl This work is supported in part by ONR and DARPA under contract N00014-91-C-0195 to Honeywell and Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland.
