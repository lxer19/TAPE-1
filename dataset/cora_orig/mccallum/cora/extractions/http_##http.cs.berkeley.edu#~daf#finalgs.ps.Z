Reference-contexts: The right half shows the element-element links for a particular threshold in this geometry. exploited it to obtain a factor of 25 speedup for image sequences where all moving objects and their paths were known in advance, by computing static relationships in a preprocessing pass <ref> [1] </ref>. George et al. use the concept of negative energy; when an object moves, some patches distribute negative energy to account for the new shadows now cast by the patch [7].

Reference-contexts: Incremental information about form-factors and solutions is not accumulated; however, Muller and Schoffel gained efficiency by using sophisticated data structures to keep track of occlusion and repropagation information [15]. Chen <ref> [2] </ref> reformulated progressive radiosity to address dynamic environments; in his approach, when an object moves, affected patches compute incremental form-factor terms, and propagate incremental radiosity. Each patch that has contributed to the existing solution must then re-shoot its incremental radiosity.

Reference-contexts: Typical recent approaches to obtaining efficient numerical solutions include: progressive radiosity, where an incremental approximate solution follows from allowing elements to "shoot" light onto every other patch <ref> [3, 13] </ref>; and importance-driven radiosity where for a particular view of a radiosity solution, an adjoint equation is used to determine the patches that make the most crucial contribution to that view [17].

Reference-contexts: 0.1 Introduction Diffuse interreflections are a source of various substantial effects in the radiance of scenes. Reproducing these effects appears to be essential to creating realistic renderings of scenes <ref> [14] </ref>. Diffuse interreflections are accurately modelled by a Fredholm equation of the second kind, which gives the radiance of a patch as that on the patch due to the source alone plus that on the patch arising from coupling to other patches.

Reference-contexts: The adaptations made to the mesh in this way could be maintained in the same way that dynamic links are maintained. We expect them to show substantial frame-to-frame coherence. Clustering groups of polygons that interact, as in the work of Sillion <ref> [16] </ref>, and lazy evaluation of links between hierarchy elements, as in the work of Holzschuch et al., both appear to offer substantive savings.

Reference-contexts: progressive radiosity, where an incremental approximate solution follows from allowing elements to "shoot" light onto every other patch [3, 13]; and importance-driven radiosity where for a particular view of a radiosity solution, an adjoint equation is used to determine the patches that make the most crucial contribution to that view <ref> [17] </ref>. When constant elements are used, the solution is smoothed using an interpola-tory scheme to avoid a harlequin appearance.

Reference-contexts: The result is an O (n 2 ) algorithm, where the dominant problem is computing the approximation to the kernel. Galerkin methods, though analytically elegant, tend to be inappropriate as a result of the extra integrations required, but have recently become more popular (e.g. <ref> [18] </ref>).
