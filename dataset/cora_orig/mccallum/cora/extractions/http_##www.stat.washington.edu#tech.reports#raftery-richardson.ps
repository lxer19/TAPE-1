Reference-contexts: It has been successfully applied to situations where there are up to 10 12 models. 3.2 Selecting Transformations with ACE The ACE (Alternating Conditional Expectations) algorithm <ref> (Breiman and Friedman, 1985) </ref> is a way of finding nonparametric transformations of the independent and dependent variables in linear regression such that the relationship is as linear as possible. See DeVeaux (1989) for an exposition.

Reference-contexts: It is usual to analyze such studies by logistic regression <ref> (e.g. Breslow and Day, 1980) </ref>. The analyst must make several decisions, including How to code the risk factors? In epidemiological studies, risk factors are often coded in several categories (typically 2 to 5). This has the advantage of allowing easy calculation of relative risks.

Reference-contexts: Generalized additive models provide an approach to modeling in the presence of nonlinearity that is similar in concept to ACE and is conceived as a direct generalization of generalized linear models <ref> (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) </ref>. However, the software to estimate them (in S-PLUS) does not yet allow for monotonicity constraints, and so we have found ACE more useful. 3.3 An Iterative Strategy The methods we have described are linked in the following iterative algorithm: 1.

Reference-contexts: That may not be the case for other biostatistical models, although approximations of similar quality are available for some hierarchical models used in health services research: beta-binomial models <ref> (Kahn and Raftery, 1991) </ref> and Poisson-Gamma models (Rosenkranz, 1992).

Reference-contexts: This has been argued to be a more appropriate form of inference (Edwards, Lindeman and Savage, 1963; Berger and Delampady, 1987), and it tends to give more reasonable results in large samples (e.g. Raftery, 1986), as well as allowing easy comparison of non-nested models <ref> (Kass and Raftery, 1994) </ref>. The methods can be implemented using the GLIB software available free of charge from StatLib. This software automatically assesses the sensitivity of the results to the prior dispersion.

Reference-contexts: In a certain sense, equation (4) is guaranteed to give better out-of-sample predictions on average than conditioning on any single model <ref> (Madigan and Raftery, 1994) </ref>. <p> Two ways of getting around this have been suggested. One of these, "Occam's Window", consists of averaging over a much smaller set of models, chosen by criteria based on standard norms of scientific investigation <ref> (Madigan and Raftery, 1994) </ref>. We use this here and describe it in Section 3.1.

Reference-contexts: The expected Fisher information matrix is F 1 = 2 X T W X, where W = diagfw 1 ; : : : ; w n g, and w 1 (1) (1) i ) <ref> (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) </ref>. Here ^ (1) i = g 1 (x i ^ fi (1) ), where ^ fi (1) is the MLE of fi conditional on M 1 . <p> This is extended to generalized linear models with other link and variance functions by noting that then estimation is equivalent to weighted least squares with the adjusted dependent variable z i = g ( i ) + (y i i )g 0 (^ i ) and weights w i <ref> (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) </ref>. The prior is the same as before, but in the transformation back to the original fi, y is replaced by z and all the summary statistics are weighted.

Reference-contexts: In our strategy, model selection is based on Bayes factors rather than on significance tests. This has been argued to be a more appropriate form of inference (Edwards, Lindeman and Savage, 1963; Berger and Delampady, 1987), and it tends to give more reasonable results in large samples <ref> (e.g. Raftery, 1986) </ref>, as well as allowing easy comparison of non-nested models (Kass and Raftery, 1994).

Reference-contexts: The composite posterior mean and standard deviation (or point estimate and standard error) are given by E [jD] = k=0 4 SD [jD] 2 = Var [jD] = k=0 Var [jD; M k ] + ^ 2 where ^ k = E [jD; M k ] <ref> (Raftery, 1992) </ref>. This general approach has been used in several previous analyses of medical and epidemiological data. Racine et al. (1986) showed how this method may be used to make inference about a treatment effect in the presence of uncertainty about the existence of a carryover effect.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter we introduce a new Bayesian modeling strategy for generalized linear models, and use it to reanalyze a case-control study in which fat and alcohol consumption and eight other risk factors were measured for 854 women <ref> (Richardson et al., 1989) </ref>. It is usual to analyze such studies by logistic regression (e.g. Breslow and Day, 1980). The analyst must make several decisions, including How to code the risk factors? In epidemiological studies, risk factors are often coded in several categories (typically 2 to 5). <p> A dietary history questionnaire administered by interview was used to measure the intake of total fat and its constituants, other nutrients and alcohol consumption. In the original analysis of this study, a positive association was found with alcohol <ref> (Richardson et al., 1989) </ref> and fat intake (Richardson et al., 1991), but the evidence for the role of fat intake was not overwhelming. Classical risk factors for BC, in particular those concerning the reproductive history, were also analysed (Segala et al., 1991).

Reference-contexts: For other biostatistical models for which such approximations are not yet available, it is often possible to use the BIC or Schwarz approximation <ref> (Schwarz, 1978) </ref>, namely log pr (DjM k ) ~ log pr (Dj ^ k ; M k ) 1 On the face of it, this is a crude approximation, but it has been observed to be surprisingly accurate.
