Title: Control Volume Meshes using Sphere Packing: Generation, Refinement and Coarsening  
Author: Gary L. Miller Dafna Talmor Shang-Hua Teng Noel Walkington Han Wang 
Abstract: In this paper we present a sphere-packing technique for Delaunay-based mesh generation, refinement and coarsening. We have previously established [10] that a bounded radius of ratio of circumscribed sphere to smallest tetrahedra edge is sufficient to get optimal rates of convergence for approximate solutions of Poisson's equation constructed using control volume (CVM) techniques. This translates to Delaunay meshes whose dual, the Voronoi cells diagram, is well-shaped. These meshes are easier to generate in 3D than finite element meshes, as they allow for an element called a sliver. We first support our previous results by providing experimental evidence of the robustness of the CVM over a mesh with slivers. We then outline a simple and efficient sphere packing technique to generate a 3D boundary conforming Delaunay-based mesh. We also apply our sphere-packing technique to the problem of automatic mesh coarsening. As an added benefit, we obtain a simple 2D mesh coarsening algorithm that is optimal for finite element meshes as well.

Reference-contexts: We also require that the angle between any two intersecting polytopes, when one is not contained in the other, is at least 90 ffi . The notion of a piecewise linear system is similar to a convex decomposition of non-manifold polyhedra <ref> [1] </ref>, but is more general. For example, a box with a segment floating in its middle can be described as a piecewise linear system with no need to further decompose it. A k-simplex S is a convex polytope of dimension k with k + 1 vertices.

Reference-contexts: The problem of generating good aspect ratio meshes has been discussed extensively in the literature (see the survey by Bern and Eppstein <ref> [2] </ref>). CVM mesh generation was assumed to pose the same requirements as FEM mesh generation, and did not merit its own discussion.

A polytope is the convex combination of finite set of points P . The dimension of the polytope is the dimension of the affine hyper-plane generated by P . The boundaries as well as the domain we consider are a collection of polytopes.

Reference-contexts: Our method is not an iterative method, and its emphasis is on laying down the spheres such that the corresponding Delaunay triangulation carries radius-edge ratio guarantees. As such, it is orthogonal to Shimada's method. (2) Bern, Mitchell and Ruppert <ref> [3] </ref> used sphere packing to generate an O (n) non-obtuse triangulation of a polygonal domain in 2D. The elements produced in that instance could be of bad aspect ratio and radius-edge ratio.

Reference-contexts: In 2D, this automatic mesh coarsening applies to good aspect-ratio (FEM) meshes as well. 1.1 Previous Work The study of mesh generation abounds in the literature. Bern, Eppstein and Gilbert <ref> [4] </ref> had the first provably optimal 2D good aspect-ratio mesh generation algorithm. The mesh they generated is based on a quad-tree. Ruppert [15] presented a simpler algorithm that produces smaller meshes in practice. <p> Mitchell and Vavasis [11] extended to 3D the quad-tree approach of Bern, Eppstein and Gilbert <ref> [4] </ref>. The simpler Delaunay triangulation approach of Ruppert and Chew has not been successfully generalized. The work of Dey, Bajaj and Sugihara [7] is a generalization of Chew's algorithm into 3D. It is targeted at quasi-uniform meshes only, and addresses only simple convex boundaries. <p> Outside of the Multi-grid domain, heuristic mesh coarsening techniques are used to reduce the size of meshes, as an intermediate step between the mesh generation and the solution phases <ref> [4] </ref>. The general method used for coarsening unstructured triangular meshes is that of picking some subset of the original mesh nodes and triangulating that set to form the coarsening. A commonly used technique is that of the Maximal Independent Set (MIS).

Reference-contexts: Such a hierarchy of coarsening meshes is necessary, for example, for the hierarchical and multi-level technique, which has become one of the most effective and successful numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It is used in multi-grid methods <ref> [5] </ref> and multi-level domain decomposition. The use of unstructured meshes is inevitable in the solution of complex problems with more intricate domain geometry and solutions. This section applies the sphere-packing technique of the previous section to the problem of two dimensional mesh coarsening.
