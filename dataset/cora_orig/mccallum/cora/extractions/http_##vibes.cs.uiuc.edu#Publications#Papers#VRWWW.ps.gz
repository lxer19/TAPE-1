Abstract: The World Wide Web (WWW) server at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is one of the most heavily accessed WWW servers in the world. To increase our understanding of how users access this server and to provide a basis for assessing server and system software optimizations, we analyzed NCSA's server performance using the Avatar virtual reality performance visualization system. The large volume of performance data generated each day, coupled with rapidly changing server access patterns, makes real-time analysis attractive. This paper presents the results of our analysis and discusses the implications for understanding time varying data in a virtual environment.

Reference-contexts: in a manner similar to keyboard shortcuts in a desktop application and can be used even when the menu interfaces of x3.3.1 are hidden. 3.4 Avatar Data Inputs To maximize portability and extensibility, Avatar has been designed to process high-dimensional data described by the Pablo Self Defining Data Format (SDDF) <ref> [1] </ref>. This data can originate from a file or can be real-time data transmitted via a network socket. <p> Below, we describe SDDF, illustrate its representation of WWW data, and describe mechanisms for real-time WWW data reduction and control. 3.4.1 Self Defining Data Format (SDDF) Avatar uses the Pablo 5 Self Defining Data Format (SDDF) <ref> [1] </ref> as its data format. SDDF is a meta-data format, in the style of HDF [17] or netCDF [23]. As such, SDDF consists of two parts: data record descriptors and data record instances defined by those descriptors.

Reference-contexts: In short, the conundrum of high-dimensional data visualization is finding presentation metaphors that successfully project the data in meaningful ways. Avatar draws on a long history of data display research in the statistical graphics community <ref> [5] </ref> by extending the notion of a two-dimensional scatterplot matrix to three dimensions. In a two-dimensional scatterplot matrix, all possible pairs of dimensions for a set of n-dimensional data are plotted against each other in separate scatterplots arranged in an n by n matrix. <p> First, 4 the matrix is symmetric; the upper and lower triangles are simple transpositions. This allows one to view whichever projection is more convenient. Second, the diagonal is degenerate | both metrics are the same for these scatterplots. In Figure 2, these degenerate scatterplots have been replaced with plots <ref> [5] </ref> showing the mean and variance of the associated metric. However, if the data were plotted in the diagonal scatter-plots, its dispersion would be visible on the diagonal. Third, data clustered in one scatterplot need not be clustered in other scatterplots. <p> These history ribbons serve two roles. First, they are markers of data paths, much as massless particles and stream lines show air movement in visualizations of computational fluid dynamic calculations. Second, they fulfill the same role as brushing in statistical graphics <ref> [5] </ref>. Interactively enabling history ribbons for a subset of the data points allows one to see if the selected points cluster in one or more scattercubes. In our implementation of history ribbons, more recent positions are rendered using bright colors; darker colors show older positions. <p> Cleveland <ref> [5] </ref> is a cogent summary of the statistics community's techniques for visualizing irregular data, Huber [8] describes early experiences with three-dimensional scat-terplots. Our work differs in its generalization of scat-terplot matrices to encompass three-dimensional scat-terplots and the integration of history lines to show phase behavior.

Reference-contexts: After computing the statistics, the analysis program produces data records in the Pablo Self Defining Data Format (SDDF); SDDF is described in greater detail in x3.4.1. The SDDF records are then transferred to the Avatar visualization module for rendering in the NCSA CAVE <ref> [6] </ref>, an unencumbered environment for immersive data analysis. In the following section, we will describe the visualization module in detail. 3 The Avatar Visualization System Avatar is a flexible, extensible framework that uses virtual reality to support analysis of complex, high-dimensional, time varying data. <p> figure, a subset of the points are clustered, with one outlier clearly visible. 3.2 Avatar Implementation To realize the Avatar metaphor just described, we have developed a virtual world implementation that operates with either (a) a head mounted display (HMD) and six degree of freedom tracker, (b) the CAVE 4 <ref> [6] </ref> virtual reality theater, or (c) a workstation display with stereo glasses. Sonification software supports real-time mapping of data to sound using either the Porsonify [14] sonification library or the CAVE's native sound library. The HMD version supports three dimensional sound spatialization via a Crystal Rivers Technologies Convolvotron [27, 26].

Reference-contexts: To cope with this ever growing dimensionality, one needs more powerful statistical data analysis techniques that can identify data correlations prior to data display. Projection pursuit <ref> [9] </ref> is one such powerful technique. It can be viewed as a generalization of principal components analysis that finds one or more optimum projections of the data variables such that the data exhibits clusters with respect to those dimensions.
