Abstract: The problem of planning the motion is investigated for distributed multiple mobile agents A method is proposed for a few heterogeneous mobile agents (robots) of different sizes and moving capabitilies to coordinate their motions in a distributed manner to achieve a map-making task. The agents are assumed to have sufficient memory to store the map and to be able to communicate with each other. Our approach makes use of an occupancy grid and a map is to be completed to a specified resolution. The algorithm is described and computer simulation of the algorithm is reported.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of distributed intelligence has been one of the active subjects in robotics and machine intelligence. Recently, problems involving multiple mobile agents (i.e., mobile robots) have been addressed by a number of researchers <ref> [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10] </ref>. The primary concern so far has been to ensure collision avoidance between multiple robots, that is, mobile robots are to be moved from their start positions to their destinations so as not to collide with each other, while avoiding a deadlock situation. <p> ValidMove resolves motion between robots in case collision is likely. In this paper, we assume that at most two robots encounter at a time. Conflict resolution for more than two robots is complex and discussed elsewhere (see <ref> [1] </ref> for example). CheckForTunnels checks the surrounding region for tunnels smaller than the exploring robots size and EnQueue enqueues, and DeQueue removes each tunnel from the appropriate call-queue. The current status of the robot is then checked for a possible change of mode. <p> From the way the algorithm is written, it must be clear that terrain acquisition can be accomplished if (1) deadlocks don't occur and (2) the smallest robot is as small as the cell size. Deadlock avoidance between multiple mobile robots is a difficult problem in its own right (see <ref> [1, 3] </ref>). Although our deadlock avoidance mechanism works most of the time, it does not guarantee the absence of deadlocks under complicated situations.

In this respect, our approach is different from approaches making use of the central planner <ref> [3] </ref> or distributed approaches with no communication [5]. In our model, robots have a mechanism to resolve conflict between themselves when such a situation arises. The approach is catered to heterogeneous robots.

See <ref> [11] </ref> for another example where agents are heterogeneous. Table 1 shows results of a number of runs obtained using our simulation program on environments with different numbers of tunnels. The left most column is the percentage of area occupied by obstacles to the entire region.
