Reference-contexts: Similar hardware-design issues have been addressed in the computer-graphics community (they've also been addressed in the video-game community, but usually in not-publicly-documented ways), and a review of computer-graphics literature (for example reference <ref> [6] </ref>) will provide additional detail. As mentioned earlier, an advantage of object decomposition is that some objects may be valid for very long periods of time, and we can save bandwidth by not retransmitting them. Availing ourselves of this advantage requires caching in the decoder, and thus intelligent memory management.

Reference-contexts: Not only must an analysis algorithm be able to solve for these higher-level models, but a decoder must be able to apply the resulting parameters in real time. A review of various model-based techniques for video coding may be found in reference <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, although each user has only a single microphone, stereo sound is generated by synthetically placing a person's voice at a location corresponding to his/her location on the screen. See also reference <ref> [11] </ref> for another example of composition applied to conferencing. 6. MORE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SYSTEM DESIGNER The current generation of standards will probably be the last for which a hardwired pipeline implementation of a single algorithm is appropriate.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm can therefore easily be described in terms of a graph structure connecting storage buffers with computational elements thus process parallelism is expressed explicitly, and execution can be parallelized at run-time, supporting multitasking and hardware scalability. In reference <ref> [12] </ref> we review the idea of streams and explain how a suitable description of the dimensional mapping can also describe data parallelism by making explicit the subsections of larger arrays that can be processed independently if multiple suitable processing elements are available.
