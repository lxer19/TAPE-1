Title: Representing Rhythmic Patterns in a Network of Oscillators

Affiliation: Indiana University  
Abstract: This paper describes an evolving computational model of the perception and production of simple rhythmic patterns. The model consists of a network of oscillators of different resting frequencies which couple with input patterns and with each other. Oscillators whose frequencies match periodicities in the input tend to become activated. Metrical structure is represented explicitly in the network in the form of clusters of oscillators whose frequencies and phase angles are constrained to maintain the harmonic relationships that characterize meter. Rests in rhythmic patterns are represented by explicit rest oscillators in the network, which become activated when an expected beat in the pattern fails to appear. The model makes predictions about the relative difficulty of patterns and the effect of deviations from periodicity in the input. The nested periodicity that defines musical, and probably also linguistic, meter appears to be fundamental to the way in which people perceive and produce patterns in time. Meter by itself, however, is not sufficient to describe patterns which are interesting or memorable because of how they deviate from the metrical hierarchy. The simplest deviations are rests or gaps where one or more levels in the hierarchy would normally have a beat. When beats are removed at regular intervals which match the period of some level of the metrical hierarchy, we have what we will call a simple rhythmic pattern. Figure 1 shows an example of a simple rhythmic pattern. Below it is a grid representation of the meter which is behind the pattern.
