Abstract: Our case-based reasoning (CBR) integration with the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) formalism has undergone several transformations on its journey from initial research idea to product-intent design. Both unexpected research results as well as interesting insights into the real-world applicability of the integrated methodology emerged as the integration was explored from alternative viewpoints. In this paper, the alternative viewpoints and the results that were enabled by these viewpoints are described.

Reference-contexts: The DCSP is therefore a sequence of CSPs, where each one differs from the previous one by the addition or removal of some constraints <ref> (Dechter & Dechter 1988) </ref>. Such an addition or deletion of constraints can cause the current solution of the CSP to be invalidated, requiring re-solving the problem.

Reference-contexts: To achieve this goal, the case-based adaptation process was formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem, where the cases were stored as CSPs (with constraints and solutions), and a CSP repair algorithm (the minimum conflicts repair algorithm <ref> (Minton, Johnston, & Laird 1992) </ref>) was used to perform the adaptation (Purvis 1995). This was a CBR-as-master approach, as CBR provided the overall problem-solving framework, with CSP helping with the adaptation process. <p> Thus, the same problem circumstances result in highly variable initial solutions on different runs. The success of the minimum conflicts repair algorithm is attributed to its use of information from the initial solution to guide its search <ref> (Minton, Johnston, & Laird 1992) </ref>. Providing the same initial solution guides the algorithm towards the same final solution. Similarly, highly variable initial solutions will result in highly variable final solutions, as in the case of greedy initialization without the case base.
