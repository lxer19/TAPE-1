Abstract: We analyze how the expected packet delay in rooted tree networks is affected by the distribution of time needed for a packet to cross an edge using stochastic comparison methods. Our result generalizes previously known results that the delay when the crossing time is exponentially distributed yields an upper bound for the expected delay when the crossing time is constant on this class of of networks. Unlike previous work, we do not assume Poisson arrivals. Our result also extends to a variety of service distributions, and it can be used to bound the expected value of all convex, increasing functions of the packet delays. An interesting corollary of our work is that in rooted tree networks, if one can change the distribution of the time to cross an edge while keeping the expectation fixed, the strategy that minimizes the expected delay and the expected maximum delay is to make the time to cross an edge constant. Our result also holds in mulitcasting rooted tree networks, where a single message can have several possible destinations.

Reference-contexts: This method has proven useful for showing the stability of networks under many different routing policies given reasonable conditions on the adversary, and can also give loose bounds on the expected delay <ref> [1] </ref>. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we will provide the necessary background on the stochastic order relation we use to prove our results. We will prove the main theorem in Section 3, and then examine its implications through various corollaries.

Reference-contexts: As the expected time a packet spends in the system in equilibrium given Poisson arrivals and exponential service times can generally be computed explicitly (for example, see <ref> [4] </ref>), this bounding technique can give useful upper bounds. Our generalization shows that these bounds can be generalized on Markovian rooted tree networks.
