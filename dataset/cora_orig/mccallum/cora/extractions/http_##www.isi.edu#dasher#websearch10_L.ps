Abstract: The World Wide Web is a rich repository of information. However, the Web is primarily designed for human users, and maintains the majority of its information in textual form. This makes reliable and efficient ways of retrieving and extracting that information from the Web difficult. Textual information has some structure, but it is not readily accessible through traditional database techniques. Its enormous size and exponential growth make the problem even more difficult. This paper describes a method that uses statistical correlation analysis techniques in order to discover useful information by recognizing certain patterns present in the Web documents. In particular, we apply our method to electronic commerce

Reference-contexts: Frequently, it is unclear how to refine a search. For example, how would users refine an initial search on the keyword, battery, to include just companies manufacturing batteries? Another approach adopted by Internet search companies, like Yahoo <ref> [7] </ref>, is to provide a directory-like service to the WWW to help users locate relevant information quickly. In a sense, the setup of the Yahoo directory provides Internet users with a wellstructured database with indexed information. Potentially a directory service can create a directory for each category of goods.

Reference-contexts: However, the scalability of these search agents is potentially limited by their overreliance on the structural layout of Web pages. Most of the information found on the Web is unstructured text. An alternative approach to this search process is to use wellstructured product information Web sites such as PartNet <ref> [8] </ref>, Thomas Publishing [9], or IndustryNet [10]. To learn more about the subcategories of products, a user can refer to these manufacturing catalog and engineering handbook sites. However, this approach introduces two other problems.

Reference-contexts: Since the number of types of products under certain product category is usually quite limited, one is only interested in perhaps the top 20 (or less) most used descriptive keywords. Poisson statistics <ref> [11] </ref> can be applied here to judge whether enough statistical information has been collected to construct a meaningful view of the most often used descriptive keywords. The Poisson statistic maybe computed dynamically as the descriptive words are extracted.
