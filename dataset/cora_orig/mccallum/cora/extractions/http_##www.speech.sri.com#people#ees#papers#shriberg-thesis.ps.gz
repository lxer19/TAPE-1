Reference-contexts: A third approach may be characterized as post-recognition, pre-parsing (Heeman & Allen, 1994). Heeman and Allen aimed to locate modification repairs in the TRAINS corpus <ref> (Allen & Schubert, 1991) </ref>. The approach involved combining the pattern-matching approach of Bear et al. with an estimation of the likelihood of DF at any particular word transition.

Reference-contexts: However, inspection of digitized DFs <ref> (e.g., Bear et al., 1992) </ref> has revealed no such localized and reliable signal. <p> that listeners cannot detect a DF until they have heard at least part of the first word in the RR, i.e. consistently later than the location of the proposed signal (Lickley, 1994.) Glottalization at the IP has been noted to occur for some percentage of DFs, particularly for vowel-final fragments <ref> (Bear et al., 1992) </ref>. However, the rate of glottalization differs across studies (Nakatani & Hirschberg, 1993; Lickley, 1994), and is by no means a reliable cue to the IP of DFs, since it frequently occurs elsewhere, in uent speech (Bear et al., 1992). 23 2.4.5.2 Unfilled pause in IM The duration <p> to occur for some percentage of DFs, particularly for vowel-final fragments <ref> (Bear et al., 1992) </ref>. However, the rate of glottalization differs across studies (Nakatani & Hirschberg, 1993; Lickley, 1994), and is by no means a reliable cue to the IP of DFs, since it frequently occurs elsewhere, in uent speech (Bear et al., 1992). 23 2.4.5.2 Unfilled pause in IM The duration of the IM is of particular theoretical relevance to models of speech production. Levelt (1983) proposed a Main Interruption Rule, which states that speech is cut off as soon as trouble is detected by the speaker. <p> For example, they could aid in the detection of sentence-initial deletions (the DF type DEL as explained in Chapter 4, called false starts in many classification systems). These DFs are difficult to detect because they often lack cues to disuency, such as repeated words <ref> (Bear et al., 1992) </ref> or similar syntactic units in succession (e.g. Hindle, 1983). The model of deletion length presented here predicts that the probability of a DF decreases by .45 for each word in the RM. <p> The AMEX and SWBD rates are not significantly different, z=1.53, p&gt;.05. 0.00 0.40 Probability of a Fragment ATIS AMEX SWBD 124 These results are consistent with past work (see Chapter 2) showing a large discrepancy between the high fragment rate in ATIS <ref> (e.g. Bear et al., 1992) </ref> and the lower rate in studies not involving human-computer interaction (e.g. Levelt, 1983; Lickley, 1994.) It is not clear what accounts for this difference between domains; however, DF type is likely to play a role. This question is investigated further in Chapter 6. <p> For cognitive models, it will be important to understand the underlying variables associated with a domain that inuence DF production. For applications, we see that research on DFs in the ATIS corpus, which has been the focus of many past studies <ref> (e.g., Bear et al., 1992, Nakatani & Hirschberg, 1994) </ref> may not predict results for certain aspects of DFs produced in more natural speech styles. Differences between ATIS and the other two corpora are not only quantitative but also qualitative.

Reference-contexts: In other accounts, filled pauses have been grouped as fillers with a wide variety of linguistic elements, including coordinating conjunctions <ref> (Blankenship & Kay, 1964) </ref>, discourse markers such as you know and well (Adams, 1982; Lutz & Mallard, 1986; Kowal, OConnell & Sabin, 1975; James, 1972), and a variety of wafing behaviors (Carletta et al., 1993). However, departures from these intuitive groupings also occur. <p> Distributionally and intonationally, these inter-sentence elements seem similar to filled pauses and discourse markers. Indeed various authors have noted anecdotally that these elements may function as productive hesitation devices <ref> (e.g. Blankenship & Kay, 1964) </ref>. In order to be able to separate out repeated or changed coordinating conjunctions from other repeats and substitutions in analyses, the coordinating conjunctions are denoted in the PLS as 'c'.

Reference-contexts: There are, however, exceptions. For example, Bock's study of production problems <ref> (Bock, 1991) </ref> concerned levels of processing; accordingly, errors were classified according to the size of the production unit (e.g., sentence, phrase, word, morpheme, syllable, phoneme). 11 pause, word change and word omission.

Reference-contexts: general relevance across languages. 7 Topics falling outside the scope specified in point (2) above include: a very large literature on unfilled pauses (Goldman-Eisler, 1968; Boomer, 1965; O'Connell & Kowal, 1983; Butcher, 1981); grammatically incoherent utterances (Brown, 1980); tails or right dislocations (Geluykens, 1987), grammatical additions spoken as an afterthought <ref> (Carletta, Caley, & Isard, 1993) </ref> and discourse markers (Schiffrin, 1987; Redeker, 1991). <p> For example, some authors use hesitation as a cover term (Maclay & Osgood, 1959; Blankenship & Kay, 1964) while others use it to refer only to DFs containing no changed material <ref> (e.g., Carletta, et al., 1993) </ref>. Similarly, O'Shaughnessy (1994) uses restart as a cover term, but for Erman (1987), restart is one of repetition, restart, insertion, and correction. <p> other accounts, filled pauses have been grouped as fillers with a wide variety of linguistic elements, including coordinating conjunctions (Blankenship & Kay, 1964), discourse markers such as you know and well (Adams, 1982; Lutz & Mallard, 1986; Kowal, OConnell & Sabin, 1975; James, 1972), and a variety of wafing behaviors <ref> (Carletta et al., 1993) </ref>. However, departures from these intuitive groupings also occur. For example, Heeman and Allen (1994) grouped filled pauses together with DFs containing a single word fragment in a class called abridged in their work on work on automatic processing of DFs. <p> For the present purposes, inserted material that constituted a full clause was not labeled using 'i' but rather as an aside. Note that in the present work there are no DFs consisting of only inserted words, i.e. cases in which modifying material is added as an afterthought <ref> (e.g., Carletta et al., 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Phenomena which are included as DFs in the thesis if corrected, but which are not described in particular detail, are speech errors (Fromkin, 1980; Nooteboom, 1980; Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1986; Baars, 1992); and prosodic errors <ref> (Cutler, 1983) </ref>. 2.3 Classification Systems Classification systems are discussed in three sections. Section 2.3.1 describes the structure of DFs and defines a standard set of terms for relevant DF regions. Section 2.3.2 briey describes common aspects of previous systems.

Reference-contexts: Human listeners are so apt at filtering out DFs that the task of recording what was actually said in utterances containing DFs is a difficult and unnatural one, often requiring many passes at transcription <ref> (e.g., Deese, 1980) </ref>. Evidence from laboratory experiments indicates that attending to DFs and comprehending what is being said are mutually inhibitory 29 processes (Martin & Strange, 1968).

Reference-contexts: We cannot deduce from this result, however, whether R1 is lengthened or R2 shortened, or whether both effects occur. The lengthening of R1 could be interpreted as hesitation. The shortening of R2 could be interpreted as a reduction effect similar to that observed for previously mentioned words in discourse <ref> (e.g. Fowler & Housum, 1987) </ref>. To investigate these alternatives, the durations of R1 and R2 were compared with durations for the same word produced in uent contexts by the same speaker. 13.

Reference-contexts: The majority of turns of three or fewer words consisted of only continuers or assessments <ref> (Goodwin, 1986) </ref> such as uh-huh and yeah which did not pose much opportunity for disuency (as discussed in Chapter 5). The original transcriptions for these turns were found to be highly accurate in a spot check. Over 25% of the disuent-turn transcriptions were modified.

Reference-contexts: Nakatani and Hirschberg analyzed cues across DF types and identified acoustic cues which, in combination with lexical and other information, could aid DF detection and correction. A third approach may be characterized as post-recognition, pre-parsing <ref> (Heeman & Allen, 1994) </ref>. Heeman and Allen aimed to locate modification repairs in the TRAINS corpus (Allen & Schubert, 1991). The approach involved combining the pattern-matching approach of Bear et al. with an estimation of the likelihood of DF at any particular word transition.

Reference-contexts: These concerns set the stage for the DF representation and classification systems developed in Chapter 4. 2.3.1 DF structure and terminology Studies in linguistics (Hockett, 1967), conversation analysis (Schegloff, 1987; Goodwin, 1986), psycholinguistics (Levelt, 1983) and computational linguistics <ref> (Hindle, 1983) </ref> have independently noted that the surface form of the majority of same-turn DFs shows first the material that will ultimately be replaced, then optionally one or more editing phrases (such as i'm sorry), followed by the replacing material. <p> These DFs are difficult to detect because they often lack cues to disuency, such as repeated words (Bear et al., 1992) or similar syntactic units in succession <ref> (e.g. Hindle, 1983) </ref>. The model of deletion length presented here predicts that the probability of a DF decreases by .45 for each word in the RM.

Reference-contexts: This rule is based on the observation that speakers may cut themselves off at any point, even within a word, and that within-words cut-offs are not constrained to preserve morphological or syllable boundaries (Levelt, 1983; Nooteboom, 1980). Under Levelt's framework of speech production <ref> (Levelt, 1989) </ref>, self-interruption is associated with a halting of the speech production process at all levels. Therefore, some minimum time is needed after the speech is cut off in order to plan the repair.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, evidence from perceptual experiments with gated or lowpass filtered speech (to eliminate semantic and syntactic cues) reveals that listeners cannot detect a DF until they have heard at least part of the first word in the RR, i.e. consistently later than the location of the proposed signal <ref> (Lickley, 1994.) </ref> Glottalization at the IP has been noted to occur for some percentage of DFs, particularly for vowel-final fragments (Bear et al., 1992). <p> However, if such cases are not counted, the rate of editing phrases is much lower. Similarly, the rate of editing phrases in other studies has been reported to be closer to 10% <ref> (e.g., Lickley, 1994) </ref>. 2.4.6.4 Retraced words in RR Speakers often retrace to words preceding the trouble element in making a repair. <p> First, since coarticulation effects across word boundaries are expected in connected speech, a word directly preceding the interruption point of a DF may be fully articulated, but may sound cut off due to a lack of these effects across the interruption point <ref> (see also Lickley, 1994) </ref>. Second, for single-phone words such as I, it is difficult or impossible to determine whether the word is prematurely cut off. <p> In addition, the F0 of FPs occurring within a clause was found to be related to the F0 of the surrounding speech. Shriberg and Lickley (1993) analyzed clause-internal filled pauses from two speech corpora: ATIS, and a corpus of British English conversational speech <ref> (described in Lickley, 1994) </ref>. The authors found that F0 values at the beginning and end of the filled pause, and at the closest preceding and following F0 peaks within the same clause (peaks typically corresponded to accented syllables) showed regular relationships. 182 the ATIS data).
