Abstract: In this document we briefly describe the Sparse Distributed Memory model and a menu-based system which allows a user to gain hands-on experience with this model. The system is designed to aid beginners by providing stored exercises and examples. It also provides experienced users with options for configuring the memory and running their own learning experiments. The system is implemented in the *Lisp language on a Connection Machine.
