Title: Learning Where To Go without Knowing Where That Is: The Acquisition of a Non-reactive Mobot

Abstract: In the path-imitation task, one agent traces out a path through a second agent's sensory field. The second agent then has to reproduce that path exactly, i.e. move through the sequence of locations visited by the first agent. This is a non-trivial behaviour whose acquisition might be expected to involve special-purpose (i.e., strongly biased) learning machinery. However, the present paper shows this is not the case. The behaviour can be acquired using a fairly primitive learning regime provided that the agent's environment can be made to pass through a specific sequence of dynamic states.

Reference-contexts: If access is only obtained implicitly, i.e., via some reward function, then the scenario is a form of reinforcement learning. 4 Given this formalization of learning, a task analysis can be derived by enumerating the ways in which the learner's output guesses may be justified by the feedback source <ref> [3] </ref>. The feedback is, of course, ultimately derived from the target mapping. Thus guesses that are justified by the feedback must, at a deeper level, be justified by the contents of the target mapping.

Reference-contexts: If it was not obvious before, the introduction of this new terminology should drive home the point that this analysis gives a foundation to the well-known Machine Learning heuristic which states that `learning relationships is hard' <ref> [4] </ref>. 10 5 Example To illustrate this notion of indirect justification, consider the following training set. This is based on two input variables (x1 and x2) and one output variable (y1). There are six training examples in all.
