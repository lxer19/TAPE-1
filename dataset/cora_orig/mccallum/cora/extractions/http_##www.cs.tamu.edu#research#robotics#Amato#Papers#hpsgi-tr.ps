Abstract: Shared memory multiprocessors provide a unified view of its memory and a simple programming paradigm to users in order to build large applications and gain significant speedups. As processor technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, the principal performance bottleneck of shared memory systems has become the memory access latency. In order to understand the effects of cache and memory hierarchy on system latencies, performance analysts perform benchmark analysis on existing state-of-the-art multiprocessors. In this study, we present a detailed comparison of the memory system of two recent commercial ventures, the HP V-Class and the SGI Origin 2000. Our goal is to compare and contrast design techniques used in these multiprocessors to tolerate the effect of memory latency. Finally, there has always been a split among researchers between the methodology used to evaluate the performance of existing systems and proposed architectures. In this study, we use micro-benchmarks as well as scientific applications to characterize the user-level performance.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we use scientific applications to take into account the overall system design and present an example of user-level performance. 3 Uniprocessor Performance Characterization In this section, we begin our characterization of cache and memory access latency. We use several uni-processor load and store benchmarks <ref> [1] </ref> to compare the performance of the HP V-Class and the SGI Origin 2000 multiprocessors. <p> Each benchmark is run over a 100 times and the average latency is used to plot the results. 3.1 Single Outstanding Load/Store Performance We characterize the latency of uniprocessor loads and stores using Load-Use (Figure 3) and Store-Use (Figure 4) benchmarks adapted from Abandah's work <ref> [1] </ref>. The benchmarks traverse an array of N eight byte elements using different stride specified by the number of elements. Current superscalar processors, including the R10000 and the PA 8000, and allow multiple outstanding processor loads and stores to take advantage of latency hiding.

Reference-contexts: In an invalidation based protocol, when a block is modified, the copies of the block in each of the sharer's caches are purged using invalidation signals. Specific enhancements to these basic schemes employed in the multiprocessors are discussed below. In V-Class protocol <ref> [2] </ref>, the enhancement to the protocol is targeted towards migratory sharing patterns. When a processor (requester) issues a read to a block that is currently dirty in another processor's (owner's) cache, the block is invalidated from the owner's cache and supplied to the requester in exclusive state.

Reference-contexts: Each DIMM memory bank provides 4-way memory interleaving on a cache line basis, so a node board could support up to 32-way interleaving (however, full bandwidth can be obtained with only 4-way interleaving). 2.2 Coherence Protocols Both the HP V-Class <ref> [3] </ref> and the SGI Origin 2000 use a variation of the invalidate-based full-map directory protocol and the well-known MESI cache protocol. However, each multiprocessor has its own enhancement to the protocol. An overview of the protocols is as follows.

Reference-contexts: To convert from exclusive to shared state later, in the case of multiple consumers, the data is sent back to memory from the first consumer (with the block in exclusive state) and then sent to subsequent consumers. In the Origin's DASH-like protocol <ref> [9] </ref>, the enhancement comes with the transfer of data. Since transferring data from the producer to the consumer takes longer than transferring control information, speculative data is supplied from the memory node and data is supplied from the producer to the consumer if dirty.
