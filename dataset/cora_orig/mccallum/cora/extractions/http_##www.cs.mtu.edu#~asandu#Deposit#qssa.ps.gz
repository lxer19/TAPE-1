Abstract: L. O. JAY y , A. SANDU z , F. A. POTRA x , AND G. R. CARMICHAEL - REPORTS ON COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS, NO. 67/1995, DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS, THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA Abstract. In the last fifteen years the Quasi-Steady-State-Approximation (QSSA) method has been a commonly used method for integrating stiff ordinary differential equations arising from atmospheric chemistry problems. In this paper a theoretical analysis of the QSSA method is developed, stressing its strengths and its weaknesses. This theory leads to practical improvements to the QSSA method. New algorithms, including Symmetric and Extrapolated QSSA are presented. 1. Introduction. As our scientific understanding of atmospheric chemistry and

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. As our scientific understanding of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics has expanded in recent years, so has our ability to construct comprehensive models which describe the relevant processes (Carmichael et al. <ref> [5] </ref>; Jacob et al. [18], Dentener and Crutzen [7] are examples of regional and global scale atmospheric chemistry models in use today). However, these comprehensive atmospheric chemistry models are computationally intensive because the governing equations are nonlinear, highly coupled, and stiff. <p> The net result is that the simulation time is of the same order as the wall-clock time. One possible solution is to move the codes on more powerful machines (e.g., a version of STEM-II, see <ref> [5] </ref>, is currently running on a CRAY-C90). Another direction would be to take advantage of the inner parallelism of the problem, and to write parallel versions of the simulation codes (some work has also been done in this direction).

Reference-contexts: The nonlinear system is solved using functional iterations. The main idea is to speed up these iterations using explicit solutions for several groups of species. The method seems to work fine for very large step-sizes. A particularly clear approach was taken by Gong and Cho <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To start the proof, we first show convergence of order one for the QSSA method (direct approach). It is worth noting that this part of the proof remains valid for variable step-sizes with h = max i jh i j. We use standard techniques (see, e.g., <ref> [12, Theorem 4.4] </ref> and [14, Theorem VI.7.5]).

It is quite amazing to notice that C 2 (y; z) is a contraction for the max-norm and 1 (g z (y; z)) = 0:01.

This assumption is actually quite natural for species with very short life-times (see (5)). <p> It is worth noting that this part of the proof remains valid for variable step-sizes with h = max i jh i j. We use standard techniques (see, e.g., [12, Theorem 4.4] and <ref> [14, Theorem VI.7.5] </ref>). <p> For the QSSA method (15a)-(15b) we have the inequalities ky n+1 k ky n k + O (hky n k + hkz n k) ;(18a) with 0 &lt; 1. Applying <ref> [14, Lemma VI.2.9] </ref> we get ky n k C 4 (ky 0 k + hkz 0 k) ; If (y k n ) with k n denotes the QSSA solution starting on the exact solution at t k , then the previous formula and (16a)-(16b) imply ky k n k C <p> O. JAY, A. SANDU, F. A. POTRA, AND G. R. CARMICHAEL In the second part of our proof we assume that the step-size h is constant. As in <ref> [14, Theorem VI.4.3] </ref> we are looking for a perturbed asymptotic expansion of the global error of the form y i y (t i ) = j=1 j z i z (t i ) = j=1 j with smooth functions a j (t), b j (t), and perturbations ff j j i <p> The remainder can be estimated as in part d) of the proof of <ref> [14, Theorem VI.4.3] </ref>. We obtain recurrence relations similar to (18a)-(18b). The process of determining the perturbed asymptotic expansion may be continued if the perturbations are exponentially decaying to zero. <p> Convergence of QSSA for the singular perturbation problem. In this section we give a proof of convergence under certain conditions of the Plain QSSA method when applied to the singularly perturbation problem (10a)-(10b). Because we are mainly interested in smooth solutions to (10a)-(10b) (see <ref> [14, Section VI.2] </ref>) we require as a stability assumption that the logarithmic norm of g z (y; z) satisfies [14, Formula VI.2.11] (g z (y; z)) &lt; 0 (23) in an "-independent neighbourhood of the solution. <p> Because we are mainly interested in smooth solutions to (10a)-(10b) (see [14, Section VI.2]) we require as a stability assumption that the logarithmic norm of g z (y; z) satisfies <ref> [14, Formula VI.2.11] </ref> (g z (y; z)) &lt; 0 (23) in an "-independent neighbourhood of the solution. By definition, the logarithmic norm of a matrix A is given by (A) = lim kI + hAk 1 (24) where I is the identity matrix. <p> We now analyze the behaviour of the QSSA method when applied to the singular perturbation problem (10a)-(10b). We will do an analysis similar to that in <ref> [14, Section VI.2] </ref>. <p> The constant L depends on the constants A; B, and C, but does not vary with n. We can apply <ref> [14, Lemma VI.2.9] </ref> to get the desired result. The hypotheses (31) are satisfied by induction on n provided the constants A; B, and C are chosen sufficiently large and h is sufficiently small, but independently of ". 6. Description of the test problem. <p> Numerical results. In this section the results for the test problem are compared to the solution computed by the code RADAU5 of E. Hairer and G.

Reference-contexts: The scheme is efficient, but difficult to generalize. Hertel, Berkowicz, Christensen, and Hov <ref> [15] </ref> proposed an algorithm based on the implicit Euler method.

All integrators have been used with a lower bound of 0:01 [seconds] imposed on the chosen step-size. <p> However, if the linear algebra is done such that full advantage of the structure of the problem is taken (see <ref> [23] </ref>) the computational time of VODE is greatly reduced 4 and the code becomes competitive. Extrapolated QSSA and Symmetric QSSA perform well compared to DAE QSSA, Iterated QSSA or CHEMEQ (especially when a NAD higher than 1 is required) but not better than Sparse VODE or TWOSTEP.

QSSA-based algorithms are explicit methods and yet they enjoy a remarkable stability. They behave like implicit methods although their evaluation formulae is explicit.

In <ref> [30] </ref> the local truncation error for Plain QSSA scheme is shown to be only O (h) for the components with small lifetimes t i t h. However, numerical experiments have shown that the QSSA solutions still converge to the exact solution.

Reference-contexts: TWOSTEP is based on the variable step size, two-step backward differentiation formula BDF2 <ref> [28, 29, 31] </ref>. Instead of a modified Newton process, Gauss-Seidel iterations are used for solving the nonlinear system of equations. This technique carefully exploits the production-loss form of the differential equation (see [28] for details). We have used the original implementation obtained directly from the authors. <p> When considering a complete 3-D model involving transport of chemical species, QSSA-type methods allow for lumping of species that results in increased efficiency. Whether the BDF codes will benefit as much from lumping remains to be seen. Preliminary work with TWOSTEP <ref> [31] </ref> shows promises in this direction. All the tested methods show small computational times for low accuracy.

Reference-contexts: An evaluation of the local truncation error of the QSSA scheme can be found in [30]. There are many specially-tailored methods in use in atmospheric chemistry models. One of the first proposed methods, and which has been extensively used, is the hybrid predictor-corrector algorithm of Young and Boris <ref> [33] </ref>. Species are divided into stiff and nonstiff; the explicit Euler method (predictor) and an explicit trapezoidal method (corrector) are used for the nonstiff part, while the stiff part is integrated with a modified midpoint scheme. S. Sillman in [27] developed an integration scheme based on the implicit Euler formula. <p> Iterated QSSA is similar to DAE QSSA, but has one extra iteration (6). 4. CHEMEQ (see <ref> [33] </ref>, implemented in CALGRID) is used as specified in [25]: * If t i &lt; 0:2 h the species is fast and is integrated with (4); * If t i &gt; 5 h the species is slow and is integrated with the nonstiff CHEMEQ formula; * For all other species the
