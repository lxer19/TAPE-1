Abstract: This paper proposes a 3-dimensional visibility representation of graphs G = (V; E) in which vertices are mapped to rectangles floating in R 3 parallel to the x; y-plane, with edges represented by vertical lines of sight. We apply an extension of the Erd-os-Szekeres Theorem in a geometric setting to obtain an upper bound of n = 56 for the largest representable complete graph K n . On the other hand, we show by construction that n 22. These are the best existing bounds. We also note that planar graphs and complete bipartite graphs K m;n are representable, but that the family of representable graphs is not closed under graph minors. Research on this paper was supported by FCAR, NSERC, NSF, and DFG.

Reference-contexts: We can assume without loss of generality that no two rectangles of a valid sequence share the same value on any of the four coordinates E,N ,W ,S. Hence we can assume that each coordinate value of each of the n rectangles is an integer in the range <ref> [1; n] </ref> without changing the visibility relationships among the rectangles. <p> By starting with a randomly-generated candidate solution and applying local modifications, other candidate solutions are generated. The choice of local transformation is guided by an objective function which the procedure attempts to minimize. See <ref> [1, 20, 23] </ref> for more information regarding simulated annealing techniques. For a given n, the algorithm tries to find a realization of K n .

Reference-contexts: Consider the projections of all the rectangles in a valid sequence onto the x; y-plane. Because each two must intersect and the objects are axis-aligned rectangles, application of a Helly-type argument shows that the intersection of all the projections must be non-empty <ref> [9] </ref>. Thus we can choose a common point O (henceforth regarded as the origin) belonging to the interior of each of the projections. To simplify the notation, we do not distinguish between a rectangle and its projection onto the x; y-plane; the meaning will be clear from the context.

(More precisely, they showed that such a representation exists for a graph if and only if the graph is planar and has an embedding with all cut vertices on the exterior face.)

Bose et al., 3-D Visibility Representation, JGAA, 2 (3) 1-16 (1998) 12 Wismath <ref> [24] </ref> and to Tamassia and Tollis [22] that any 2-connected planar graph has what [22] calls an "-visibility representation. (Vertices correspond to closed, disjoint, horizontal line segments in the plane, and two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if their corresponding segments are "-visible in the vertical direction.) <p> This is similar to an idea of <ref> [24] </ref> for obtaining a visibility representation for all planar graphs by rectangles in R 2 that have "-visibility in both the x and y directions. For ease of notation, let P 1 represent the plane z = 1 and let P 1 represent the plane defined by z = +1. <p> Base case for the induction: G is 2-connected. We say a line segment is a y-segment if it is parallel to the y-axis and lies in the y,z-plane. By the result of Wismath <ref> [24] </ref> and Tamassia and Tollis [22], G can be represented by (planar) "-visibility restricted to the z direction of y-segments, with only the segment representing the vertex v visible from below. Place the y,z-plane containing this configuration in 3-space at x = 0.
