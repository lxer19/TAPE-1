Abstract: P-1 All horses are the same color; we can prove this by induction on the number of horses in a given set. Here's how: "If there's just one horse then it's the same color as itself, so the basis is trivial. For the induction step, assume that there are n horses numbered 1 to n. By the induction hypothesis, horses 1 to n - 1 are the same color, and similarly horses 2 through n are the same color. But the middle horses, 2 through n - 1, can't change color when they're in different groups; these are horses, not chameleons. So horses 1 and n must be the same color as well, by transitivity. Thus all n horses are the same color; QED." What, if anything, is wrong with this reasoning? P-2 Consider four dice containing the numbers indicated below. For each pair of dice, say D i and D j with 1 i; j 4 and i 6= j, compute the probability that on a fair toss of the two dice, the top face of D i will show a higher number than the top face of D j . (Show the results in a 4fi4 matrix.) Solution: Here is the result matrix.
