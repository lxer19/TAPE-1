Abstract: Synchronous messages are usually generated periodically and each of them is required to be transmitted before the generation of the next message. Due to the inherent deficiency in its Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, an FDDI token ring can use at most one half of its ring bandwidth to transmit synchronous traffic. This deficiency greatly reduces the FDDI's capability of supporting multimedia applications like real-time voice/video transmissions. In this paper, we show how a few simple modifications to the FDDI's MAC protocol can remove this deficiency and double a ring's ability of supporting synchronous traffic. The modified protocol, called FDDI-M, preserves all other good features of an FDDI network and can also achieve a higher throughput for asynchronous traffic than the standard FDDI and the FDDI-II, thus making it useful even for those networks without heavy synchronous traffic. 1 The work reported in this paper was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research under Grant

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a proposed ANSI standard for a 100 Mbps token ring network using a fiber-optic medium <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. During the past several years, a large number of FDDI networks have been installed and this number is still increasing rapidly.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a proposed ANSI standard for a 100 Mbps token ring network using a fiber-optic medium <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. During the past several years, a large number of FDDI networks have been installed and this number is still increasing rapidly. <p> Notice that a packet's type is identified by the first bit of the Frame Control (FC) field in the packet's header <ref> [2] </ref>, thus no need to change the packet format. The use of the late counter L c can also be eliminated since the token will never be late using the modified token passing protocol. <p> The network simulated is a medium-size FDDI single ring of 50 nodes and 92-kilometer ring length. Assuming a node latency of 0.6 microsecond and a propagation delay of 5.085 microseconds per kilometer <ref> [2] </ref>, the ring has a latency T ring = 0:5 ms. According to the FDDI standard, the maximum-packet size is 36 Kbits, and thus, the maximum packet transmission time T p = 0:36 ms. The synchronous traffic under consideration is the digital motion video signals compressed with the MPEG [4].

Reference-contexts: It also ensures the average time between two consecutive token's visits to a node not to exceed the TTRT <ref> [3] </ref>. The bandwidth of synchronous traffic that a node i can transmit is guaranteed by assigning the node a portion of the ring's TTRT, called the high-priority token holding time, h i . <p> Then, under the condition that P N1 i=0 h i T T RT T ring T p , the worst-case and average token rotation times will not exceed 2fiT T RT and T T RT , respectively <ref> [3] </ref>. As discussed in Section 1, this difference between the worst-case and average token rotation times halves the FDDI's capacity of accommodating synchronous traffic. The idea of our modifications to the FDDI's MAC protocol is to control the worst-case token rotation time not to exceed the TTRT.

Reference-contexts: Taking motion video transmission as an example, each channel of video signal, after compressed with the MPEG <ref> [4] </ref>, has an average signal bandwidth of 1.5 Mbps. Ideally, a 100 Mbps ring would be able to support b100=1:5c = 66 video channels. <p> According to the FDDI standard, the maximum-packet size is 36 Kbits, and thus, the maximum packet transmission time T p = 0:36 ms. The synchronous traffic under consideration is the digital motion video signals compressed with the MPEG <ref> [4] </ref>. Each MPEG video channel has an average signal rate of approximately 1.5 Mbps and the video frames are transmitted at the rate of 30 frames/second. So, the frame generation period T = 33 ms. Each video frame is required to be transmitted before the generation of the next frame.

Reference-contexts: 9 Mbps bandwidth must be assigned to each video channel, reducing the FDDI's video supporting capacity to only b100=9c = 11 channels. 3 To accommodate real-time communication more efficiently, a hybrid protocol, called the FDDI-II, has been proposed by adding time-division circuit switching to the existing packet-switched FDDI token ring <ref> [5] </ref>. With the FDDI-II, users can set up circuits with bandwidth of multiples of 64 Kbps up to 98.304 Mbps. This solves the first problem mentioned earlier but the circuit-switched nature of the FDDI-II worsens the second problem.

Reference-contexts: When a node has a message smaller than the maximum size or does not have a synchronous message to transmit (e.g., during the silent period in a voice conversation), the guaranteed bandwidth is wasted <ref> [6] </ref>. This problem becomes serious when most of the ring bandwidth is used to establish circuits and/or when there is heavy asynchronous traffic.

Reference-contexts: No modifications to the upper layer software are required. So, an existing FDDI network can be easily upgraded transparently to the users. The modified protocol is similar to the token passing protocol proposed in our earlier paper <ref> [7] </ref>. The purpose of that protocol was to maximize the guaranteed throughput for asynchronous traffic, while the one proposed in this paper is to increase the network's ability of supporting synchronous traffic. This paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: Another salient feature of an FDDI network is its fairness in transmitting asynchronous messages <ref> [8] </ref>. If a number of nodes have a large amount of asynchronous traffic to transmit, then all nodes will achieve approximately an identical average asynchronous throughput. FDDI-M preserves this feature.
