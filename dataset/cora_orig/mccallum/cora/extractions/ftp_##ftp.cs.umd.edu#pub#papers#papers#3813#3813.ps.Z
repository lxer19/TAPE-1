Abstract: Most Land cover types are "anisotropic", that is, the solar radiation reflected by the surface is not uniform in all directions. Characterizing the Bidi- rectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of the earth's surface is critical in understanding surface anisotropy. Though there are several methods to retrieve the BRDF of various land cover types, most of them have been applied over small data sets collected either on ground or from aircraft at limited spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we use multi-angular, multi-temporal and multi-band Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data set to retrieve the global BRDF in the red and near infrared wavelengths. The PAL data set used in our study has a spatial resolution of 8-km and 10-day composite data for four years (1983 to 1986). In particular, we develop high performance algorithms to retrieve global BRDF using three widely different models. Given the volume of data involved (about 27 GBytes), we attempt to optimize the I/O time as well as minimize the overall computational complexity. Our algorithms access the global data once, followed by a redistribution of land pixel data to balance the computational loads among the different nodes of a multiprocessor system. This strategy results in an optimized I/O access time with efficiently balanced computations across the nodes. Experimental data on a 16-node IBM SP2 is used to support these claims and to illustrate the scalability of our algorithms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction At regional scales, satellite-based sensors are the primary source of information to study the earth's system science, as they provide the needed dynamic temporal view of the earth's surface. Surface reflectance measurements from satellite data have been widely used to detect land cover change <ref> [1] </ref>, surface albedo and energy budget [2], seasonal and inter-annual vegetation dynamics [3], and to derive biophysical parameters [4, 5] . However, the spectral measurements taken by most of the existing sensor systems (e.g. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) are directional.

The BRDF models can be broadly classified into physically based models, empirical models and semi-empirical models. Physically based models include geometric- optical models <ref> [10] </ref>, turbid medium models [11, 12], hybrid models [13] and computer simulation models [14, 15, 16]. The physical models are complex, computationally demanding and, thus far, these models have only been developed for specific land cover types, with no known universal models for different cover types.

Reference-contexts: The empirical models are simple to use and have been applied fairly widely, although the model coefficients may not have a physical meaning. One of the most widely used empirical model is that of Modified Walthall model <ref> [17] </ref>, expressed as: ( s ; v ; ; ) = a 0 ( 2 s ) + a 1 2 s + a 2 v s cos + a 3 (3) where a 03 are the parameters of the model.

Reference-contexts: Semi-empirical models try to provide the balance between the physically providing empirical coefficients that have a physical meaning. One of the models that has been 3 successfully tested is that of Rahman et al. <ref> [18] </ref>, which describes the surface BRDF as: where F (g) = [1 + fi 2 2fi cos ( g)] 2 1 + R (G) = 1 + 1 + G 1 In the above set of equations there are three unknown parameters 0 , k and fi which have to be <p> The coefficients describe the general shape of the BRDF for each pixel and could be potentially used to discriminate between different landcover types <ref> [18] </ref>. Consider for example, the coefficient a 3 for channels 1 and 2 respectively from the modified Walthall model for the third quarter (July-September) during 1983 86 shown in Figure 8. The quantity a 3 is the nadir reflectance value in the individual AVHRR bands for this model. <p> This parameter describes the variations in reflectance with view and illumination angles. Thus, it indicates the level of anisotropy of the surface <ref> [18] </ref>. It can be clearly seen from Figure 9 that the spatial variations of this parameter are closely related to the variations in landcover types. Lower values of k mean higher anisotropy. Vegetated areas show higher anisotropy in band 1 compared to band 2. <p> An efficient method is presented here to handle the large data set involved. Our implementation optimizes I/O access time and efficiently balances computations across the nodes, which is achieved by redistributing the land pixels evenly across all the nodes. Although the iterative model of Rahman et al. <ref> [18] </ref> was computationally more intensive compared to the modified Walthall model, results from the two algorithms were similar. The input data for these two models had to be partitioned into discrete time intervals to minimize the effects of surface phenology on BRDF retrieval.

The input consists of four years (1983 1986) of PAL data set that has a spatial resolution of 8-km with a 10-day composite <ref> [20] </ref>. Although PAL data set spans from 1981 to 1994, we only choose these 4 years of data because the data from the other years has processing errors.

Reference-contexts: Spatial and temporal variations in NDVI from AVHRR have been shown to be correlated with phenology of land cover <ref> [21] </ref>. <p> To our knowledge, this is the first time the coefficients of any BRDF model have been determined at a global scale.
