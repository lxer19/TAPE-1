Title: A Flat Rigid Plate is a Universal Planar Manipulator

Abstract: We consider the problem of parallel part manipulation, i.e., the simultaneous position and orientation control of one or more parts in a bounded region of the plane. We propose a novel, minimalist device, based on a single horizontally-vibrating flat plate. We show that a closed rigid motion of the plate, involving its 3 dofs, can be computed which produces desired average forces at a finite number of points, e.g., parts' locations. This implies that one or more parts can follow independent trajectories simultaneously, as they interact with a single vibrating plate. This is in sharp contrast with more complex designs such as massively-parallel actuator arrays and/or prehensile manipulation. Dynamic simulation is used to test the current method in two parallel part manipulation examples. A prototype of the device has been built with inexpensive parts; physical implementation of the proposed method is currently underway.

Reference-contexts: A limitation of the current approach is that the generated force fields are divergence-free, and therefore not appropriate for force-field-based sensorless manipulation <ref> [8] </ref>. In the setup envisioned, permanent sensing is required (e.g., low-level vision) which informs the algorithm about parts' positions. Dynamic simulation is used to verify the algorithmic/numerical validity of our method. In one experiment, two parts follow user-defined, independent trajectories, simultaneously, as they interact with the plate. <p> In manipulating parts with force fields, non-zero divergence can be used to automatically reduce the uncertainty about a part's location and/or orientation (see <ref> [8] </ref> for an example). Unfortunately, the divergence of a frictional force field r = x;x + y;y is, by inspection, zero everywhere.
