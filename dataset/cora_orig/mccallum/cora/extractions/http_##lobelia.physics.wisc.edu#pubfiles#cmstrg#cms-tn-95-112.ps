Abstract: We study the performance of a minor modification to the CMS Technical Proposal level-1 calorimeter electron/photon trigger algorithm and some new algorithms for electron/photon trigger that use fine grain information from the CMS crystal calorimeter. We report that a simple fine grain EM isolation algorithm does not provide a substantial reduction in the background rate for single electron/photon trigger. This algorithm provides a drop from a rate of 5.7 kHz, for the Technical Proposal algorithm with hadronic isolation only, down to 3.6 kHz, with nominal E t cutoff of 30 GeV. We also report that a more complex DAQ filter type algorithm using EM shower isolation in ECAL crystals yields about a factor of four additional reduction in rate over that of the Technical Proposal algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Although the goal of a 20 GeV E t cutoff for a single electron/photon trigger with a QCD background rate below 6 kHz at nominal LHC luminosity is formidable, improvements of the TP algorithms within the financial and technical constraints should be explored. One simple algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> explored in this paper attempts to characterize the energy deposits in crystals within the EM trigger tower as shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Note that these results are understandable because the background that passes the TP level-1 algorithm is dominated by EM-rich showers. These results appear to agree with the full GEANT simulations of 0 reduction in ECAL crystals <ref> [6] </ref> which show a factor of three reduction at 30 GeV E t . 7 Caveat These studies depend critically on the description of transverse profile of the EM showers.
