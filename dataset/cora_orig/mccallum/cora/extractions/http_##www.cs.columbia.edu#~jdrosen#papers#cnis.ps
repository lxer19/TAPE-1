Title: Internet Telephony: Architecture and Protocols an IETF Perspective  
Author: Henning Schulzrinne Jonathan Rosenberg 
Date: July 2, 1998  
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science Bell Laboratories Columbia University Lucent Technologies  
Abstract: Internet telephony offers the opportunity to design a global multimedia communications system that may eventually replace the existing telephony infrastructure. We describe the upper-layer protocol components that are specific to Internet telephony services: the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) to carry voice and video data, and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for signaling. We also mention some complementary protocols, including the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) for control of streaming media, and the Wide Area Service Discovery Protocol (WASRV) for location of telephony gateways.

Reference-contexts: Personal mobility, call 1 delegation, availability, and desire to communicate make the process of signaling more complex. On the other hand, streaming media can make use of time-axis manipulations, such as fast-forward or absolute positioning. In the Internet, the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) <ref> [1] </ref> is the standard protocol for controlling multimedia streams. Section 5 describes the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2] co-developed by the authors for signaling Internet telephony services.

Section 5 describes the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <ref> [2] </ref> co-developed by the authors for signaling Internet telephony services. Both RTSP and SIP are part of a protocol stack that has recently emerged from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture [3] . <p> Advanced services: From first experiences and protocols, it appears to be far simpler to develop and deploy advanced telephony services in a packet-switched environment than in the GSTN [17, 18]. Internet protocols, such as SIP <ref> [2] </ref> that support standard CLASS (Custom Local Area Signaling Services) [19] 5 features (such as Call Forward No Answer) take only a few tens of pages to specify. <p> There are two protocols that have been developed for such signaling operations, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <ref> [2] </ref>, developed in the IETF, and H.323 [34], developed by the ITU. In the next section, we will discuss SIP, while H.323 is covered by Toga et al. within this issue. 5.1 SIP Overview SIP is a client-server protocol.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 describes the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2] co-developed by the authors for signaling Internet telephony services. Both RTSP and SIP are part of a protocol stack that has recently emerged from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture <ref> [3] </ref> . The protocols encompass both IPtel services and stored media services in an integrated fashion. Figure 1 depicts the stack, along with other protocols likely to be used for both Internet streaming media and Internet telephony.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 depicts the stack, along with other protocols likely to be used for both Internet streaming media and Internet telephony. Unlike circuit-switched telephony, Internet telephony services are built on a range of packet switched protocols. For example, the functionality of the SS7 ISUP and TCAP <ref> [4] </ref> telephony signaling protocols encompass routing, resource reservation, call admission, address translation, call establishment, call management and billing. In an Internet environment, routing is handled by protocols such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [5], resource reservation by the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) [6] or other resource reservation protocols [7]. <p> As mentioned earlier, gateways to existing telecommunications systems will have to play a large role in the transition to an Internet-based telecommunications infrastructure. We are currently investigating the interconnection of SIP servers with the SS7 (ISUP) protocol <ref> [4] </ref>, so that a gateway can become a first-class citizen in the telephone network (in other words, interface to the telephone network using an NNI as opposed to UNI). Gateways of SIP to H.323 are also under study.

Reference-contexts: For example, the functionality of the SS7 ISUP and TCAP [4] telephony signaling protocols encompass routing, resource reservation, call admission, address translation, call establishment, call management and billing. In an Internet environment, routing is handled by protocols such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) <ref> [5] </ref>, resource reservation by the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) [6] or other resource reservation protocols [7]. SIP, described here, translates application-layer addresses, establishes and manages calls.

Reference-contexts: In an Internet environment, routing is handled by protocols such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [5], resource reservation by the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) <ref> [6] </ref> or other resource reservation protocols [7]. SIP, described here, translates application-layer addresses, establishes and manages calls. There is currently no Internet telephony billing protocol in the Internet, although RADIUS [8] or DIAMETER [9], in combination with SIP authentication, may initially serve that purpose for calls through Internet telephony gateways. <p> This leads to tremendous flexibility and extensibility. New application level services, such as the web, email, and now IP telephony, can be created and deployed by anyone with access to the Internet. IP Telephony separates call setup from reserving resources. In the Internet, protocols such as RSVP <ref> [6] </ref> are used to reserve resources. These protocols are application independent, and reservations may take place before or after actual flow of data begins. When used after the flow of data begins, the data will be treated as best effort. <p> Due to its tight delay constraints, IPtel streams are also likely candidates for guaranteed QOS. Unfortunately, existing proposals such as RSVP <ref> [6] </ref> are rather complex, largely due to features such as receiver orientation and support for receiver diversity that is likely to be of limited use for Internet telephony.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, protocol components can be reused in other applications, avoiding re-invention of specific functions in each application. Even though the term Internet telephony is often associated with point-to-point voice service <ref> [10] </ref>, none of the protocols described here are restricted to a single media type or unicast delivery.

Reference-contexts: The real-time transport protocol (RTP) [14] used for Internet telephony easily supports talker indication in both multicast and bridged configurations and can convey more detailed information if the caller desires. 1 There is a more difficult issue of maintaining the same IP network address when changing providers <ref> [11] </ref>. 4 User interface: Most POTS and ISDN telephones have a rather limited user interface, with at best a two--line liquid crystal display or, in the public network, cryptic commands like *69 for call-back.

Reference-contexts: However, automated white-pages services, such as those run by Four11, allow another layer of indirection which further alleviates the number portability problem. 3 Features of Internet Telephony The architectural differences described in the previous section lead to a number of advantages from both a user perspective and a carrier perspective <ref> [12] </ref>, beyond just cheaper phone calls: Adjustable quality: While IPtel currently has the reputation for tin-can quality (due to low bitrate codecs, in part) there is no reason (except lack of bandwidth) why the same technology cannot supply audiophile quality music.

Reference-contexts: Because the Internet is not a service-specific network, the media exchanged is chosen entirely by end systems. As such, end systems can control the amount of compression based on network bandwidth <ref> [13] </ref> or the content to be transmitted. For example, music-on-hold (as it is not speech) is not suitable for very low bit-rate speech codecs. Security: The Internet has the reputation as being insecure, even though it is probably easier to tap a telephone demarc box than a router.

Reference-contexts: Together, these provide cryptographically secure communications. User identification: Standard POTS and ISDN telephone service offers caller id indicating the number (or, occasionally, name) of the caller, but during a bridged multi-party conference, there is no indication of who is talking. The real-time transport protocol (RTP) <ref> [14] </ref> used for Internet telephony easily supports talker indication in both multicast and bridged configurations and can convey more detailed information if the caller desires. 1 There is a more difficult issue of maintaining the same IP network address when changing providers [11]. 4 User interface: Most POTS and ISDN telephones <p> It is necessary to indicate to a receiver where the beginning or end of a frame is, in order to aid in synchronized delivery to higher layers. These services are provided by a transport protocol. In the Internet, the Real Time Transport Protocol <ref> [14] </ref> is used for this purpose. RTP has two components. The first is RTP itself, and the second is RTCP, the Real Time Control Protocol. Transport protocols for real time media are not new, dating back to the 1970's [20].

Reference-contexts: In the Internet, the Real Time Transport Protocol [14] is used for this purpose. RTP has two components. The first is RTP itself, and the second is RTCP, the Real Time Control Protocol. Transport protocols for real time media are not new, dating back to the 1970's <ref> [20] </ref>. However, RTP provides some functionality beyond resequencing and loss detection: Multicast-friendly: RTP and RTCP have been engineered for multicast. In fact, they are designed to operate in both small multicast groups, like those used in a three-person phone call, to huge ones, like those used for broadcast events.

Reference-contexts: Loose Session Control: With RTCP, participants can exchange identification information such as name, email, phone number, and brief messages. Encryption: RTP media streams can be encrypted using keys that are exchanged by some non-RTP method, e.g., SIP or the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <ref> [21] </ref>. 4.1 RTP RTP is generally used in conjunction with the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), but can make use of any packet-based lower-layer protocol. <p> Media capabilities convey the media that a participant is capable of receiving and their attributes. Media capabilities and media destinations are conveyed jointly as part of the payload of a SIP message. Currently, the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <ref> [21] </ref> serves this purpose, although others are likely to find use in the future 2 . SDP expresses lists of capabilities for audio and video and indicates where the media is to be sent to. It also allows to schedule media sessions into the future and schedule repeated sessions.

Reference-contexts: If many users simultaneously join a group, as is common in broadcast applications, each user will have an incorrect, and very low estimate of the group size. The result is a flood of RTCP reports. A back-off algorithm called reconsideration <ref> [22] </ref> is used to prevent such floods. 4.3 Payload Formats The above mechanisms in RTP provide for services needed for the generic transport of audio and video. However, particular codecs will have additional requirements for information that needs to be conveyed.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, anyone can register a name (so long as it has not been used), and procedures are defined for doing so.

The issue of reservations for IPtel services has another facet: if a reservation fails, the call can still take place, but using best effort transport of the audio. This is certainly preferable to a fast-busy signal, where no communications at all are established.

Reference-contexts: These rely on user subscription (to facilitate network engineering) and packet classification and marking at network peripheries. From the above discussion, IPtel is a prime candidate for such a service. In fact, the premium service <ref> [33] </ref> provides almost no delay and jitter for its packets, making it ideal for real time voice and video. 5 Signaling: Session Initiation Protocol A defining property of IPtel is the ability of one party to signal to one or more other parties to initiate a new call.

This URL may well be placed in a web page, so that clicking on the link initiates a call to that address, similar to a mailto <ref> [35] </ref> URL today. We anticipate that most users will be able to use their email address as their published SIP address.

Reference-contexts: be a domain, which is then resolved into one or more possible domain mail server hosts via Domain Name System (DNS) MX (mail exchange) records. 12 This not only saves space on business cards, but also allows re-use of existing directory services such as the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) <ref> [36] </ref>, DNS MX records (as explained below) and email as a last-ditch means of delivering SIP invitations.

Reference-contexts: Generally, the client will need to provide input, indicating many of these preferences, for the selection to take place. In essence, a telephony gateway is a service, and the client desires to select a server for this service based on some criteria. Extensions to the Service 16 Location Protocol <ref> [37] </ref> for discovery of wide area services [38] have been proposed which seem applicable to telephony gateways [39]. As discussed in Section 5.1, SIP can be used to translate addresses as the request moves from SIP server to SIP server.

Reference-contexts: With widespread use of IP telephony, IP telephony voicemail is likely to follow. In order to support retrieval and recording of voicemail (which could easily include video), a protocol is necessary to give a user VCR like controls over the voicemail server. The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) <ref> [40] </ref> is used for this purpose. RTSP allows a client to instruct a media server to record and playback multimedia sessions, including functions such as seek, fast forward, rewind, and pause. RTSP, like SIP, is a textual protocol similar in format to HTTP. RTSP integrates easily with SIP, in fact.
