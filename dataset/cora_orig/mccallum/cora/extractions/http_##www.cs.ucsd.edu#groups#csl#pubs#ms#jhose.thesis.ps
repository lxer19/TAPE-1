Reference-contexts: In this study we look at queueing delay only, propagation and packet processing delays are not considered. 3 Chapter II Scheduling with Service Curves 2.1 The SC-EDF Scheduling Policy The Service Curve-based Earliest Deadline First (SC-EDF)[5] scheduling policy is motivated by the notion of a service curve, introduced by Cruz <ref> [1] </ref> as a general framework for characterizing the service provided to a connection by the network. The purpose of SC-EDF is to provide real-time QOS guarantees for sessions with bursti-ness constraints. Throughout this work we will assume that time is divided into slots, numbered . <p> The sink was responsible for recording the total time each packet spent queued while waiting to be serviced. Finally, the sink discarded the packet, deallocating its associated memory. 4.2 Network Service Curves The concept of a network service curve, , is defined by Cruz <ref> [1] </ref> as follows. Consider a virtual circuit consisting of switches. Let the traffic entering switch , , be denoted by with traffic from switch feeding into switch . Define and . The backlog at switch at the end of time is given by .

Reference-contexts: It is shown in <ref> [2] </ref> that a leaky bucket constrained session is the most general type of session for which an upper bound on delay can be provided by servers with finite link capacity.

Reference-contexts: The user would specify the desired function and supply the necessary parameters, such as burstiness and average rate, to achieve a customized service curve <ref> [4] </ref>. In this study a session requests a service curve by specifying the capacity C, of the link over which the traffic is being generated, the leaky bucket filter parameters r and s, and the maximum allowable delay.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, the scheduling policies aim to shield the connections from ill-behaved sources. 2 In this study we investigate the behavior of a scheduling discipline for performance guarantees via service curves called SC-EDF <ref> [5] </ref> using simulation. A comparison of delay distributions is made between SC-EDF, VirtualClock [7], and the first-come first-served (FCFS) discipline.

A basic assumption of SC-EDF as presented in <ref> [5] </ref> is that the system is slotted and time takes on only integer values. The network simulation application, OPNET, used for this study uses continuous time and thus it was necessary to model a slotted time network within this framework.

Reference-contexts: Computing the worst case delay bound is one way to provide QOS guarantees. The worst case delay bounds are computed upon call admission to determine whether a call can be admitted at its requested QOS. It is shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that worst case bounds tend to be greater than the actual worst case observed delays, often by an order of magnitude or more. This results in under utilization of the network. <p> The duration of the ON and OFF states is exponentially distributed with mean duration of for the ON state and a mean duration of for the OFF state. For the standard voice model, ms and ms <ref> [6] </ref>. For a source generating at 32Kbps, ms gives us an average burst length of 26.566 packets. The control packet source (source 3) was given an average burst length of 5 packets or approximately 2Kb worth of data occurring an average of once each second.
