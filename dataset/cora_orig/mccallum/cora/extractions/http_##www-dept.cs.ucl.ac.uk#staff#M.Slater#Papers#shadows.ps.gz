Abstract: This paper describes an experiment where the effect of dynamic shadows in an immersive virtual environment is measured with respect to spatial perception and presence. Eight subjects were given tasks to do in a virtual environment. Each subject carried out five experimental trials, and the extent of dynamic shadow phenomena varied between the trials. Two measurements of presence were used - a subjective one based on a questionnaire, and a more objective behavioural measure. The experiment was inconclusive with respect to the effect of shadows on depth perception. However, the experiment suggests that for visually dominant subjects, the greater the extent of shadow phenomena in the virtual environment, the greater the sense of presence.

Reference-contexts: Subjects were able to master these controls very quickly. 3.2 Shadow Algorithm and Frame Rates The shadow algorithm is described in detail elsewhere [3]. It is based on a dynamic Shadow Volume BSP tree <ref> [2] </ref>, constructed from polygons in arbitrary order, that is without the necessity of a separate scene BSP tree. Shadows are created as polygons in object space. Creation of new shadows and changes to shadows are communicated dynamically to the renderer via the Director.

It is based on a dynamic Shadow Volume BSP tree [2], constructed from polygons in arbitrary order, that is without the necessity of a separate scene BSP tree. Shadows are created as polygons in object space. <p> Even in this very small scene the rendering frame rate was no where near adequate on this particular architecutre, though its performance is excellent on standard workstations running under X11 <ref> [3] </ref>. There is clearly a lot of work to do in the location of this algorithm in the dVS system architecture, in order to obtain maximum performance by minimising communication bottlenecks.

Reference-contexts: P is the number of "high" questionnaire scores, as a count out of 6. We therefore treated P as a binomially distributed dependent variable, and used logistic regression. In logistic regression <ref> [4] </ref>, the dependent variable is binomially distributed, with expected value related by the logistic function to a linear predictor. Let the independent and explanatory variables be denoted by x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x k .

Reference-contexts: We 1 emails: mel, bigfoot, yiorgos @ dcs.qmw.ac.uk. URL: http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/ introduce dynamic shadows to examine whether such task performance can be enhanced. We have argued elsewhere <ref> [8] </ref> that presence is the key to the science of immersive virtual environments (virtual reality). We distinguish, however, between immersion and presence. Immersion includes the extent to which the computer displays are extensive, surrounding, inclusive, vivid and matching. The displays are more extensive the more sensory systems that they accommodate.

Reference-contexts: In this shadow experiment therefore we employed an updated version of the questionnaire we used in <ref> [10] </ref> which is given to the subjects before attending the experimental session. This questionnaire attempts to elicit their preferences regarding visual, auditory and kinesthetic modes of thinking. It presents 10 situations, each one having three responses (one visual, one auditory, and one kinesthetic response).

Reference-contexts: They are inclusive to the extent that all external sensory data (from physical reality) is shut out. Their vividness is a function of the variety and richness of the sensory information they can generate <ref> [11] </ref>. In the context of visual displays, for example, colour displays are more vivid than monochrome, and displays depicting shadows are more vivid than those that do not. Vividness is concerned with the richness, information content, resolution and quality of the displays.
