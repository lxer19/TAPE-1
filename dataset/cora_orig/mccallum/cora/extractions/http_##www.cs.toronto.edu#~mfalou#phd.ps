Reference-contexts: This behavior was observed in real multicasts over the Internet by Almeroth and Ammar <ref> [AA97] </ref>. The build-up is like a join-only session. Once the group reaches the specified size, we add and remove nodes pseudo-randomly: first, we select pseudo-randomly with equal probability between a join and a leave, and then we select an eligible node to associate with the request.

Reference-contexts: The protocol has been presented in the Inter-Domain Multicast Routing (IDMR) working group of the 41st Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting [IET98]. The idea of incorporating QoS in the routing process was considered feasible and promising. A draft of our protocol <ref> [BFP98] </ref> has been submitted, which is the first step of the long process that may lead to an Internet standard 1 . 7.2 Future Work For the join-only problem, for less asymmetric graphs, we see a discrepancy between the lower and upper bounds for the Greedy algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This work introduces the term transit-stub graphs to describe hierarchical graphs that have a Random Euclidean graph at the higher level (transit graph) and tree structures for the lower level (stub graphs). Casner provides an actual topology of the multicast-capable Internet routers in 1994 <ref> [Cas94] </ref>. This graph represents an actual instance of the multicast backbone (MBone) network. In other words, the employed multicast Internet protocols were running on this graph in 1994. The graph has 84 nodes (or routers) and 92 undirected edges, which leads to an average degree of 2:2 (see fig. 6.1). <p> For a wide range of such graphs, the relative performance of the Greedy and the Naive is comparable to that of the 32-MBone graph. 74 * The whole network. We use the 84-MBone graph, which is based on the map by Casner <ref> [Cas94] </ref>. We use a range of 84-node Random Euclidean graphs. First, we vary the graph parameters, and we create Random Euclidean graphs for which the relative performance of the algorithms is as similar to that of the 84-MBone.

Actually, Greedy usually does better than Naive even in the join-leave case, as we saw in section 6.2 and in other studies <ref> [DL93] </ref> [Wax93]. Given the dominant use of these algorithms, the results can be used for the interpretation and performance prediction of applied algorithms and protocols. In our research, the intuition from these results has played an important role in the rest of this work. 3.

The algorithms developed here can be useful in other heterogeneous problems, such as real-time multicast communications in ATM networks <ref> [FK97] </ref>. 4. QoSMIC is a promising Internet protocol that is able to support QoS requirements. QoSMIC is the first proposed scalable QoS-sensitive Internet protocol. Its routing combines the Greedy and Naive approaches in a flexible and dynamic framework.

Reference-contexts: We call this graph the 32-MBone graph, and we consider it a real model of an interdomain graph. Simulations on multicast protocols by Keshav and Paul <ref> [KP98] </ref> and Zegura et al. [ZCD97] lead to the following two observations: 1. The performance of algorithms in hierarchical graphs is determined by the performance of the algorithms in each domain. <p> Intuitively, we can see that in a hierarchy, the points that connect the levels act as bottleneck points that all algorithms have to use. Therefore, the differences of the algorithms appear only within levels: in each domain, and at the interdomain level <ref> [KP98] </ref> [ZCD97]. 2. The size of the graph has little effect on the performance of algorithms in hierarchical graphs. An intuitive explanation relates this phenomenon to the fact that the diameter of a hierarchical graph increases only logarithmically with its size [KP98]. <p> levels: in each domain, and at the interdomain level <ref> [KP98] </ref> [ZCD97]. 2. The size of the graph has little effect on the performance of algorithms in hierarchical graphs. An intuitive explanation relates this phenomenon to the fact that the diameter of a hierarchical graph increases only logarithmically with its size [KP98]. In our work, we examine the performance of our algorithms on topologies that attempt to model the topologies of intradomains or the whole network. In both cases, we experiment with real graph instances, and various Random Euclidean graphs. <p> The simulations presented here indicate that the results we observe on the 32-MBone and 84-MBone graphs are also observed in a variety of other graphs. 2. The graph size does not seem to affect the relative performance significantly, which also agrees with previous experimental work <ref> [KP98] </ref>. 3. The relative performance on the 84-MBone is considerably reduced compared to that on the 32-MBone graph (see figures 6.2, A.1). We can explain this, if we recall that the 84-MBone graph includes the 32-MBone graph plus 52 nodes that appear in trees. <p> From a routing point of view, these 52 nodes do not introduce any interesting cases, but they increase the tree cost of both solutions by the same amount, which reduces the advantage of using Greedy over Naive. Recall that this observation confirms previous experimental work by other researchers <ref> [KP98] </ref>. 107 14000 18000 22000 26000 30000 Tree Cost Asymmetry Greedy Naive Figure A.1: Tree Cost versus Asymmetry in the 84-MBone map for the static problem with group-size 10.

Reference-contexts: This conclusion challenges the intuition that stems from the worst case analysis of chapter 3. In addition, the Internet community has been reluctant to use Greedy-based multicast routing, and one of the main concerns was a possible tree degradation with time <ref> [Tha98] </ref>. All of the above suggest that in selecting a routing algorithm, it is worth considering Greedy. * In the heterogeneous case, stream-selection is crucial for an effective use of our resources.

Reference-contexts: However, the observed performance of Greedy does not approach its worst case performance in several experimental studies including our experiments. Actually, Greedy usually does better than Naive even in the join-leave case, as we saw in section 6.2 and in other studies [DL93] <ref> [Wax93] </ref>. Given the dominant use of these algorithms, the results can be used for the interpretation and performance prediction of applied algorithms and protocols. In our research, the intuition from these results has played an important role in the rest of this work. 3.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, we want to examine the performance of protocols and algorithms in: a) intra-domain topologies, b) inter-domain topologies, and c) the whole network. The most recent and comprehensive study of creating graphs that model Internet topologies is conducted by Zegura et al. <ref> [ZCD97] </ref>. Their work compares several ways of creating realistic models for both domains and the network as a whole. Inter-domain topologies. Zegura et al. suggest the Random Euclidean family of graphs, which was originally introduced by Waxman [Wax88]. <p> We call this graph the 32-MBone graph, and we consider it a real model of an interdomain graph. Simulations on multicast protocols by Keshav and Paul [KP98] and Zegura et al. <ref> [ZCD97] </ref> lead to the following two observations: 1. The performance of algorithms in hierarchical graphs is determined by the performance of the algorithms in each domain. Intuitively, we can see that in a hierarchy, the points that connect the levels act as bottleneck points that all algorithms have to use. <p> Intuitively, we can see that in a hierarchy, the points that connect the levels act as bottleneck points that all algorithms have to use. Therefore, the differences of the algorithms appear only within levels: in each domain, and at the interdomain level [KP98] <ref> [ZCD97] </ref>. 2. The size of the graph has little effect on the performance of algorithms in hierarchical graphs. An intuitive explanation relates this phenomenon to the fact that the diameter of a hierarchical graph increases only logarithmically with its size [KP98]. <p> In more detail, we experiment with the following topologies. * Intradomain and Interdomain separately. In the case of domains with tree structure, all intradomain routing decisions are uniquely defined, so there is no point in studying it further. The other suggested choice for domains is Random Euclidean graphs <ref> [ZCD97] </ref>. Similarly, for interdomain topologies, most of the existing and most recent research suggests the Random Euclidean graphs, as we already mentioned. We use the 32-MBone graph, which we described above. We experiment with a large number of 32-node Random Euclidean graphs by varying the a and b parameters.
