Abstract: Psychoacoustic studies show that human listeners are sensitive to speaking rate variations [10]. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are even more affected by the changes in rate, as double to quadruple word recognition error rates of average speakers have been observed for fast speakers on many ASR systems [6]. In our earlier work [5], we studied the causes of higher error and concluded that both the acoustic-phonetic and the phonological differences are sources of higher word error rates. In this work, we have studied various measures for quantifying rate of speech (ROS), and used simple methods for estimating the speaking rate of a novel utterance using ASR technology. We have also implemented mechanisms that make our ASR system more robust to fast speech. Using our ROS estimator to identify fast sentences in the test set, our rate-dependent system has 24.5% fewer errors on the fastest sentences and 6.2% fewer errors on all sentences of the WSJ93 evaluation set relative to the baseline HMM/MLP system.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we discuss ways to measure the ROS of a novel sentence reliably and use this information in the recognition process. In our experiments, we use ICSI's hybrid HMM/MLP speech recognition system (explained in <ref> [1] </ref>). <p> Combining the two methods, though, was not always beneficial. Studying the interaction between these two adaptations may lead to better robustness techniques. In particular, we are considering the use of a discriminant HMM approach <ref> [1] </ref> to simultaneously learn the acoustic and phonetic dependencies on rate.

Reference-contexts: ANALYSIS OF FAST SPEECH In our earlier work [5], we explored two sources for the higher error rate of faster sentences: (acoustic-phonetic and phonological causes. First, we were able to train artificial neural networks to discriminate between fast and slow frames (using PLP <ref> [2] </ref> and energy features) for a given phone and gender. The discrimination accuracy on average was about 70%, and for some vowels between 80-90%.

Reference-contexts: Increasing the phone exit probability improved the error the most. The intuition behind this is that certain manners of articulation (e.g. vowels) are more likely to shorten in fast speech than others (e.g. stops) <ref> [3] </ref>. Therefore we increased the exit probabilities in a graded scale with stops at the bottom of the scale, vowels on top, and all other phones in between. The assigned probabilities for the 0.7-0.9 lexicon are reported in table 3.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION There are demonstrable speaking rate differences between speakers 1 . Miller et al. <ref> [4] </ref> have shown that the articulation rate varies considerably within each and across speakers. These rate alterations modify the acoustic fine structure of individual syllables and affect properties that convey segmental information for both consonants and vowels [7]. <p> Speaker categorization is more intuitive, as we tend to think of speakers, and not just a set of particular sentences, as belonging to either a fast or slow group. The disadvantage is that for a given speaker, the ROS varies considerably across sentences <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.1.3. Units of ROS Does words/second more accurately characterize ROS or phones/second? Although words/second is a simpler unit to calculate, it is coarser than phones/second and may cause inaccuracies. Consider the two perennial favorite examples of speech researchers: "How to wreck a nice beach" and "How to recognize speech".

Reference-contexts: ASR systems, perhaps even more than humans, are sensitive to the rate of speech differences, as double to quadruple word recognition error rates of average speakers have been observed for fast speakers [6]. In our earlier work <ref> [5] </ref>, we investigated the acoustic-phonetic and the phonological differences of fast speech as the source of high word error, and implemented mechanisms to make our ASR system more robust to fast speech given a priori 2 information that enabled us to calculate the ROS. <p> Formula for Calculating the ROS There are (at least) two ways to calculate the ROS of an utterance. One measure is the Inverse of Mean Duration (IMD), where the total number of phones is divided by the total duration of the sentence <ref> [5] </ref> as in ROS IMD = n P i duration i , where n is the total number of phones, and duration i is the duration of each phone i in the sentence. <p> TIMIT is primarily a phone recognition task, and the word recognition error rate is high given our simple back-off bigram grammar (estimated from the TIMIT training set). We will revisit these methods for WSJ0 in Section 4.1. 3. ANALYSIS OF FAST SPEECH In our earlier work <ref> [5] </ref>, we explored two sources for the higher error rate of faster sentences: (acoustic-phonetic and phonological causes. First, we were able to train artificial neural networks to discriminate between fast and slow frames (using PLP [2] and energy features) for a given phone and gender. <p> The improvements on this combined system was slightly less than the improvements with the tuned lexicon alone. Perhaps both modifications are making up for the same fast speech differences, and when combined together, may do "over-modification". 5. CONCLUSIONS In earlier work <ref> [5] </ref>, we conducted a number of exploratory experiments to determine the likely sources of speech recognition errors due to fast speech. We concluded that both the acoustic-phonetic and the phonological differences are sources of higher word error rates.

One is to perform word recognition on the novel utterance and use the hypothesized transcription for the forced alignment (also suggested by <ref> [8] </ref>). The advantage of this method is that we can rely on higher level knowledge (i.e., language model) to get a more accurate phonetic segmentation.
