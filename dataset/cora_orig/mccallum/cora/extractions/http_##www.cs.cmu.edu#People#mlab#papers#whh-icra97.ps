Title: Mechanics for Vibratory Manipulation  
Author: Wesley H. Huang Matthew T. Mason 
Affiliation: Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: Vibratory manipulation is any mode of manipulation involving repeated impacts due to a striker which follows some periodic motion. In this paper, we study vibratory manipulation in the context of tapping planar objects which slide on a fixed support surface. We are interested in the behaviors an object exhibits under such excitation. There are two distinct types of tapping that can result: continuous tapping, in which the object is always in motion, and intermittent tapping, in which the object comes to rest between taps. We first examine vibratory manipulation in one dimension, adapting results from related work to find conditions for stable periodic motion. The general two dimensional case is closely related to our previous work in impulsive manipulation which examined the mechanics of a sliding rotating object. In fact, vibratory manipulation is an approximation to the limiting cases of impulsive manipulation. We develop the limiting cases for intermittent and continuous tapping for rotationally symmetric objects and conclude with some examples.

This system can exhibit bounded chaotic behavior, though we are primarily interested in regular periodic behaviors. One key result from Holmes is the relation between striker frequency and amplitude for stable periodic bouncing.

Reference-contexts: Mirtich and Canny [14] introduced the idea of impulse-based dynamic simulation, in which all contact between objects is modeled as a series of microcollisions. The limiting cases of impulsive manipulation developed in this paper build upon the results of Huang et al. <ref> [12] </ref> which presented an analytical formulation and solution of the mechanics of tapping a rotationally symmetric object. These limiting cases examine the mechanics as the impulse delivered by a tap approaches zero. Many of the results of this paper are covered in greater detail in Huang and Mason [13]. <p> These objects have the special property that they slide in a straight line. (Thus we need only consider a two dimensional state space.) As discussed in Huang et al. <ref> [12] </ref>, the net force and torque on a rotationally symmetric object are functions of only the ratio ! v . The equations of motion are: ! ) = m _v (2) ! ) = I _! (3) where F and T are the force and torque loads on the object. <p> These val ues of f in turn determine the closest and furthest CORs possible for this limiting case. Huang et al. <ref> [12] </ref> formulated the impact cone which represents the set of velocities that can be achieved by striking an object at rest.
