Abstract: Permission is granted to copy and distribute this document for any purpose and without charge, including translations into other languages and incorporation into compilations, provided that the copyright notice and this notice are preserved, and that any substantive changes or deletions from the original are clearly marked. Abstract This specification defines a lossless compressed data format. The data can be produced or consumed, even for an arbitrarily long sequentially presented input data stream, using only an a priori bounded amount of intermediate storage. The format presently uses the DEFLATE compression method but can be easily extended to use other compression methods. It can be implemented readily in a manner not covered by patents. This specification also defines the ADLER-32 checksum (an extension and improvement of the Fletcher checksum), used for detection of data corruption, and provides an algorithm for computing it.

Reference-contexts: CM = 8 denotes the deflate compression method with a window size up to 32K. This is the method used by gzip and PNG (see references <ref> [1] </ref> and [2] in Chapter 3, below, for the reference documents). CM = 15 is reserved. It might be used in a future version of this specification to indicate the presence of an extra field before the compressed data.

Reference-contexts: Peter Deutsch. (See reference <ref> [3] </ref> in Chapter 3, below) Other compressed data formats are not specified in this version of the zlib specification. ADLER32 (Adler-32 checksum) This contains a checksum value of the uncompressed data (excluding any dictionary data) computed according to Adler-32 algorithm.

Reference-contexts: ADLER32 (Adler-32 checksum) This contains a checksum value of the uncompressed data (excluding any dictionary data) computed according to Adler-32 algorithm. This algorithm is a 32-bit extension and improvement of the Fletcher algorithm, used in the ITU-T X.224 /ISO 8073 standard. See references <ref> [4] </ref> and [5] in Chapter 3, below) Adler-32 is composed of two sums accumulated per byte: s1 is the sum of all bytes, s2 is the sum of all s1 values. Both sums are done modulo 65521. s1 is initialized to 1, s2 to zero.
