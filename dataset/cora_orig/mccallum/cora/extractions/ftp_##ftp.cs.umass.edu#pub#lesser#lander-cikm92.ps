Title: Customizing Distributed Search Among Agents with Heterogeneous Knowledge  
Author: Susan E. Lander and Victor R. Lesser

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts  
Abstract: Negotiated search, a paradigm for cooperative search and conflict resolution among heterogeneous, reusable, expert agents has been implemented in a flexible framework, TEAM. We present negotiated search and discuss the use of customized negotiated-search strategies that take advantage of specific capabilities and relationships that exist in an agent set. Strategies are dynamically selected based on the individual agents' views of the problem-solving situation and on communicated knowledge about the characteristics of agents in the agent set. We present experiments that show strategies can reduce the amount of search required to find mutually-acceptable solutions and can improve the quality of those solutions. The use of customized negotiated-search strategies has far-reaching implications for the design of agents that are intended to be reusable and for the assembly of agents into application systems.

Reference-contexts: Although the blackboard literature provides a great deal of insight into the behavior of semi-independent knowledge modules [14], TEAM provides specific modularity, decentralized-control, conflict-resolution, and coordination capabilities that are not present in traditional blackboard systems [13]. Coordination in multi-agent systems has been extensively investigated <ref> [1, 3, 20, 23] </ref>. The themes of coordination and conflict resolution are closely related: conflict resolution activities often require coordination and coordination activities often require conflict resolution.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, global consistency requires that different perspectives and beliefs cannot co-exist within an agent set. However, different perspectives can actually be quite beneficial, particularly in creative problem-solving situations <ref> [2] </ref>. The question then becomes whether or not local-and-shared consistency, as described above, is achievable and desirable.

Reference-contexts: Sycara describes a negotiation system, PERSUADER, for a non-cooperative labor/management domain [22]. Because of the hostile nature of the agents, a mediator is used to buffer interactions and make objective decisions. Pruitt [17] and Fisher <ref> [5] </ref> offer insights into human negotiation. Much of the human conflict-resolution process is driven by the need to protect the egos of the participants and is not directly applicable.

Reference-contexts: From constraint-directed reasoning, we adapt a simple representation of constraints to bound local and shared problem spaces. Sophisticated constraint-directed reasoning such as that developed by Fox <ref> [6] </ref> is not directly applicable to heterogeneous-agent problem solving because its relies on developing an understanding of the solution space through analysis of constraints and constraint variables.

Reference-contexts: It is not possible to anticipate and engineer out all potential conflicts at agent-development time since it is not known what knowledge will be contained in the complete system <ref> [7] </ref>. Thus, conflict resolution is an integral part of problem solving among logically heterogeneous agents and is an important aspect of negotiated search. There are two basic ways to characterize approaches to conflict resolution in negotiated search: extended search and relaxation.

Reference-contexts: However, some ideas about search and creativity in computational conflict resolution have evolved from this work. 4 Knowledge Consistency In this section, we describe how private and shared information is maintained and assimilated by an agent in negotiated search. In <ref> [8] </ref>, Huhns describes a distributed truth-maintenance approach to database management. We do not intend to imply that we use distributed truth-maintenance techniques. However, by examining the definitions of terms presented in that work, we can contrast and justify our approach under the requirements of agent heterogeneity and reusability.

Reference-contexts: Although these agents have heterogeneous resource requirements, they are implementationally homogeneous and use that homogeneity implicitly for control. The negotiation literature provides insight into the underlying mechanisms of conflict resolution and the development and application of specific negotiated-search operators. Klein <ref> [9] </ref> has focused on the development of a taxonomy of conflict types. Werkman has developed a multi-agent system that relies on an integrated knowledge representation and mediation framework to discriminate among alternative solutions from different perspectives [24]. Sycara describes a negotiation system, PERSUADER, for a non-cooperative labor/management domain [22].

Reference-contexts: Section 2 describes TEAM. In Section 3, we relate our work to that of other researchers. Requirements for knowledge consistency are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 gives a brief description of the negotiated-search paradigm and its realization in the TEAM framework. A more detailed description is available in <ref> [11] </ref>. Section 6 presents the general concept of negotiated-search strategies, defines a specific strategy called linear-compromise, and compares the performance of the system with and without linear-compromise. 2 The TEAM Framework The TEAM framework supports loosely coupled, heterogeneous agents engaged in problem-solving through negotiated search. <p> Agents are distinct and independent entities that communicate through a shared memory. 2 In TEAM, agents can be added to or deleted from an agent set using a standard procedure detailed in <ref> [11] </ref>. To enable this level of agent autonomy, information in the system is partitioned in layers of abstraction. There are three major classes of information: one that is accessible only to the system, one that is accessible to all agents, and one that is accessible only to an individual agent. <p> STEAM is described in <ref> [12, 11] </ref>. Critique-solution is an operator that takes an exter-nally initiated solution as input and checks to see if any local solution requirements or preferences are violated in that solution. <p> If no strategy is found, the default general negotiated-search strategy described earlier is used. Selection and assignment algorithms and a communication protocol have been implemented for TEAM and are described in <ref> [11] </ref>. Once a strategy has been chosen and roles are as 5 Note that negotiating over possible strategies and role assignments can itself be treated as a conflict situation with the same type of iterative search/relaxation methodology that applies to domain problem-solving.
