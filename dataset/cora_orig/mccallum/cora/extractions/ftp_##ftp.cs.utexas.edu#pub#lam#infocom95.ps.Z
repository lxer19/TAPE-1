Abstract: We observed that variable bit rate (VBR) video, which is a sequence of encoded pictures, has very large rate fluctuations from picture to picture. In designing a new traffic model, we retain the basic notion of a flow but allow the flow rate to fluctuate. In particular, we introduce the concept of a burst which, in a video flow, is a sequence of packets that carry the bits of an encoded picture. We present the architecture of a class of packet switching networks, called Burst Scheduling networks, for carrying video, audio, and data traffic. The class is characterized by (i) use of virtual clock value as priority in scheduling, (ii) end-to-end delay and delay jitter guarantees provided to flows conforming to the new traffic model, and (iii) traffic flows (in particular, video flows) scheduled efficiently in bursts. Some experimental results are presented from a discrete-event simulation in which traces from several MPEG video sequences were used as video sources.

Reference-contexts: An efficient scheduling algorithm is specified. The architecture and algorithm are motivated by two recent findings in our research project: (i) From studying the characteristics of MPEG video <ref> [5] </ref>, we found that traffic specifications assumed by existing rate-based disciplines are inadequate for representing video; in particular, the packet generation rate of a VBR video source changes substantially and 1 The delay jitter over a set of items is the maximum differ ence between the delays of any two items <p> It ranges from a low of about 10,000 bits for a B picture to a high of about 300,000 bits for an I picture (for some MPEG sequences encoded at a spatial resolution of 640 fi 480 pixels <ref> [5] </ref>). For delivery by a packet switching network, each picture is segmented to be the payload of a large number of packets (e.g., ATM cells). Thus, the rate of such a source changes every 1/30 second, varying from a low of 0.3 Mbps to a high of 9 Mbps. <p> However, as soon as the video source has encoded a picture, the size of the burst (number of packets) is known and its rate, to be called the picture's packet rate, can be determined. Specifically, if lossless smoothing is used, the rate is available from the smoothing algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. If not, the rate can be computed from the picture size, the picture rate (e.g., 30 pictures per second), and the packet payload size. Information on the rate and size of each burst can be exploited in scheduling packets. <p> Each video source generates bursts of 53-byte packets with the size and packet rate of each burst obtained from a trace file. The trace files are from MPEG sequences that have been smoothed by the lossless algorithm in <ref> [5] </ref>. When packets were generated within a burst, the interpacket gap was fixed and was computed from the size and rate of each burst in the trace file. We used a fixed interpacket gap to make the simulation run faster.

Reference-contexts: The delay guarantee is useful because it is conditional. As such, it does not require the service facility (actually the designer and implementor of the facility) to be concerned with the behavior of sources, of which the facility has no control <ref> [6] </ref>. There is no requirement that sources be flow controlled or well-behaved. Even though the reserved rate of flow f is r (f ), its source can misbehave, i.e., its traffic generation rate can be arbitrary. <p> network, and * channels deliver the flow's packets reliably (i.e. in-order delivery with no loss). 11 A virtual clock delay guarantee, in general, is a deadline measured from the virtual clock value of an arrival. 12 For an in-depth treatment of assumptions and guarantees between service providers and consumers, see <ref> [6] </ref>. However, when a flow, say v, misbehaves (as a result of unreliable packet delivery or source regulator malfunctioning), the network's service guarantees to other flows should be unaffected. To meet this requirement, it is sufficient that flow regulators compute correct virtual clock values.

Note that if we consider each burst as an integral unit, Lemma 2 provides a burst delay bound which depends on the length of burst i. <p> The separation timing constraint is assumed to determine the aggregate rate of active flows. Delaying packets to satisfy the jitter and separation timing constraints is called burst restructuring and retiming, respectively <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> It is sufficient to implement each flow queue as a FIFO queue.) As a result, the restructuring and retiming of packets in a burst are accomplished for all j if they are performed for the first packet in the burst <ref> [7] </ref>. When a new flow arrives at a switch (presumably after an end-to-end session has been established), a flow queue is created for the flow, as well as a flow regulator for the queue. <p> Specifically, u i contains information on how much the first packet should be delayed to achieve burst restructuring <ref> [7] </ref>. When the procedure is called, P contains the earliest time when the burst retiming constraint is satisfied. <p> of burst i, for i = 1; 2; : : :, has the following lower and upper bounds: D (i; 1) i K X 1 + s=0 D (i; 1) i 1hi 1 g + s=1 fl s K X t s A proof of Theorem 2 is given in <ref> [7] </ref>.

(ii) We discovered and proved a delay guar-antee for the Virtual Clock service discipline <ref> [10] </ref>. The balance of this report is organized as follows.

In particular, the concept of a conditional delay guarantee is introduced. <p> of a VC server has not been exceeded for a nonzero duration since the start of a busy period, then the following holds for every packet p that has been served during the busy period: L (p) P (p) + C A proof of Theorem 1 can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. Fixed assignment or demand assignment may be used to ensure that a VC server's capacity is not exceeded. Note that the active flow definition can be exploited to increase the number of flows that statistically share a VC server. <p> We have presented an algorithm for scheduling the transmission of both guaranteed flows and available-bit-rate traffic in a packet switch. The algorithm has been designed to compute virtual clock values very efficiently by making use of the new traffic model and the delay guarantee proved in <ref> [10] </ref>. Such efficiency is needed to enable use of small packets, such as ATM cells, to carry video and audio traffic. A Burst Scheduling network provides end-to-end delay and delay jitter bounds to flows that satisfy the Flow Specification when entering the network.
