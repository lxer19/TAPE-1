Abstract: The representation of a scene at different levels of detail is necessary to achieve real-time rendering. In aerial views only part of the scene that is close to the viewing point needs to be displayed with a high level of detail, while more distant parts can be displayed with a low level of detail. However, when the sequence of images is generated and displayed in real-time, the transition between different levels of detail causes noticeable temporal aliasing. In this paper, we propose a method, based on object blending, that visually softens the transition between two levels of Delaunay triangulation. We present an algorithm that establishes, in an offline process, a correspondence between two given polygonal objects. The correspondence enables on-line blending between two representations of an object, so that one representation (level of detail) progressively evolves into the other.

Reference-contexts: However, since this method does not have a tree hierarchy, it is difficult to combine parts from different levels of detail in the same scene. A survey is given by De Floriani et al. [3]. De Berg and Dobrindt <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a hierarchy of levels of detail that uses Delaunay triangulation at each level. It is the first method that uses Delaunay triangulation, and also allows different levels of detail to be combine in the same scene. This technique achieves spatial continuity of the terrain for each rendered picture. <p> Then I i+1 = I i J i . The critical point is to construct the levels such that the union of the triangles at every level is a Delaunay triangulation. This is achieved using the De Berg and Dobrindt method <ref> [1] </ref>. They proposed restricting the selection of vertices J to be removed from I such that if p is selected (p 2 J ) then all the adjacent vertices q k of p are not selected (q k 62 J ). <p> The resulting triangulation is indeed Delaunay, since a removal of a vertex, and retriangulating its hole preserves the Delaunay criteria <ref> [1] </ref>. To construct the different levels of detail we need to choose a criteria for selecting the subsets J i to be removed from the set I i . Specifically, we select a set of vertices whose distance-to-plane measure is minimal [14]. <p> After every deletion, the polygonal hole for that vertex is re-triangulated using the Delaunay triangulation. It is important to emphasis that the hierarchical representation we propose has a tree structure, rather than a general graph <ref> [1] </ref>. In [1] triangles from different detail levels are combined by defining an intermediate level between every two successive levels. The nodes of this level correspond to the star-shaped polygons which are the union of triangles incident to the vertices to be removed. <p> After every deletion, the polygonal hole for that vertex is re-triangulated using the Delaunay triangulation.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it necessary to select a vertex p from the kernel of the polygon, or in other works, a vertex that sees all the vertices of A. Only in very rare cases no such vertex exists <ref> [2] </ref>. Nevertheless, if this special case exists, it can be detected and avoided. Unfortunately, the Delaunay triangles of the coarser object do not necessarily have a single common point (see Figure 8). To deal with this more complex case we propose a two-stage blending procedure.

Reference-contexts: A pseudo-code of the off-line correspondence algorithm is given in Figure 10. 4 RESULTS The proposed hierarchy and blending algorithm were implemented in C++ on a PC-Pentium 120MHZ with 16MB memory. We used the Greenland terrain database <ref> [8] </ref> which contains 115; 000 points. We decimated the database down to 19; 000 points to consist of 36; 927 triangles. The second level contains 9; 883 points and 40; 000 triangles, and the coarsest level contains 3; 795 points and 8; 374 triangles only.

Reference-contexts: The second approximation method is the greedy insertion method, where the algorithm begins with a simple triangulation of the height field, and successively inserts input points that pass certain criteria, until the desired level of approximation is achieved. For example, Heckbert and Garland <ref> [9] </ref> successively insert the point with the maximal error in the current approximation. Further research concentrated on rendering a terrain in different levels of detail using a hierarchical representation [4, 5, 6, 7, 13].

Reference-contexts: Heckbert and Garland <ref> [10] </ref> give an extensive survey of works of this kind. Two basic methods were researched. The first, the decimation algorithm, starts with a triangulation of the entire height field, and successively removes vertices that meet certain criteria, until the desired levels of approximation are obtained.

Reference-contexts: This creates two new objects that have the same shape as the two original objects and share a common topology. Merging the two original topologies can be done by combining the edges of the two objects; new vertices are defined where they intersect, and new triangles are created accordingly <ref> [11] </ref> (see Figure 6). The blending is done by interpolating the heights of corresponding pairs of vertices. The problem with this approach is that the intermediate object has more triangles than the original detailed object, while our initial motivation was to decrease the number of triangles.

Reference-contexts: Even with recent progress in graphics hardware performance, it is impossible to achieve this with such a large number of triangles. Efficient use of the number of triangles that are fed into the geometric pipeline is an important consideration <ref> [12] </ref>. Clipping out triangles which fall out of the viewing pyramid is necessary, but far from satisfactory, since at a distance the viewing pyramid extends and covers huge areas. Other culling techniques which are effective for indoor walk-through [16] are not effective for outdoor scenes.

Reference-contexts: This technique achieves spatial continuity of the terrain for each rendered picture. The above work, like most others in this field, have not dealt with temporal continuity. In <ref> [15] </ref> a TIN-morphing is suggested to blend between two levels of detail, where the terrain is represented by a hierarchical irregular rectangular mesh. However, a novel hierarchical Delaunay representation and an associated rendering method is called for, that guarantees both spatial and temporal continuity in Delaunay triangulated terrain. times.
