Abstract: This paper presents experimental results comparing two different designs for a spoken language interface to email. We compare a mixed-initiative dialogue style, in which users can flexibly control the dialogue, to a system-initiative dialogue style, in which the system controls the dialogue. Our results show that even though the mixed-initiative system is more efficient, as measured by number of turns, or elapsed time to complete a set of email tasks, users prefer the system-initiative interface. We posit that these preferences arise from the fact that the system initiative interface is easier to learn and more predictable.

Reference-contexts: Ive got your mail. U: Read me my messages from Kim. A: The message from Kim is about Meeting Tomorrow. The meeting tomorrow is at 10:30 in 2D-516. The SI strategy prompts users what to say at each stage of the dialogue with directive prompts <ref> [2] </ref>. Since prompts must be short, the SI strategy typically executes actions by small increments at each turn. The MI strategy assumes 2 that users know what to say, and never volunteers information.

Reference-contexts: All of the users regularly used computers in the course of their everyday work and were familiar with email. In one study, the 12 users were administrative assistants or researchers whose area of research was not related to SLIs. We reported results from this study elsewhere <ref> [5] </ref>. Subsequently, we noticed that response delay was longer than we wanted and that there was a different way of communicating with the email application layer that would significantly reduce it. After implementing the improved version, we then tested another 36 users in both versions of ELVIS.

Reference-contexts: For example, in scenario 1.1, the user is expecting email from Kim about a meeting and needs to find out the time and place of that meeting (as in Dialogue D1 and D2). Following <ref> [6] </ref>, this scenario is represented in terms of the attribute value matrix (AVM) in Table 2. The AVM representation for all six subtasks is similar to Table 2. <p> This supported the use of the Kappa statistic to measure Task Success <ref> [6] </ref>, where Kappa is defined as: K = P (A) P (E) / 1- P (E) P (A) is the proportion of times that the AVM for the dialogue agrees with the AVM for the scenario key, and P (E) is the proportion of times we would expect the AVMs for <p> One interpretation of our results is that users are more attuned to qualitative aspects of the interaction. To explore this idea further, we first analyzed the relationship between CSAT and our other measures, drawing on the PARADISE framework <ref> [6] </ref>, and its use of multivariate linear regression. We first normalized all measures to their Z scores to ensure that the magnitude of the coefficients in the regression equation would reflect the magnitude of the contribution of that factor to CSAT.

Reference-contexts: The single most important design choice is the selection of dialogue strategies that the SLI uses in conversations with the user. One key factor is whether the dialogue strategy is system-initiative (SI) or mixed-initiative (MI) <ref> [7] </ref>. These strategies are illustrated in D1 and D2 for ELVIS (EmaiL Voice Interactive System), an SLI for accessing email by phone: (D1: System Initiative Strategy ) A: Hi, Elvis here. You have 5 new and 0 unread messages in your inbox. <p> We discuss results for each of these factors as they relate to our hypotheses. We first calculated Task Success in terms of Kappa to see whether task completion rates and scores were affected by dialogue strategy <ref> [7] </ref>. The average Kappa value over all subjects and tasks was .82, indicating that the task was almost always completed successfully. An ANOVA with Kappa as the dependent variable revealed no significant differences for Kappa as a function of task or strategy.
