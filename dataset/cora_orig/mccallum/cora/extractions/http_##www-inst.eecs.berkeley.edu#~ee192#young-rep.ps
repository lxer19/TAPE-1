Abstract: Human eyes focus on objects with changes in vergence, the position of the eyes, and accommodation, the thickness of lens. Since many vision problems involve errors in accommodation, a change in focal power of the lens corrects the problem. Due to the close relationship between two features, one can approximate changes in accommodation from measuring vergence. The project uses this idea to enable aq pair of glasses to vary its focal power. Special sensors on the glasses track the movement of the eyes. Then the microprocessor calculates the vergence using the amplified signals from the sensors. With calculated changes in vergence, actuators move make necessary adjustments on the lens. MPEG movie of the glasses and the report is available over the internet via WWW address; http://po.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee192 and my own WWW address; http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~youngc.
