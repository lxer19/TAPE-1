Reference-contexts: hardness result for this class of problems is known in the recent framework of complexity of approximating NP-hard optimization problems [11]: The node-deletion problem for every nontrivial hereditary property is MAX SNP-hard [14]; thus, it does not have a polynomial time approximation scheme unless P - 2 - = NP <ref> [1] </ref>. In fact, the Vertex Cover problem (VC for short) can be reduced more directly to the FVS problem in an approximation preserving manner, so that any performance ratio r &lt; 2 for the latter problem would imply the same ratio r for the former problem.

Reference-contexts: A better approximation of the VC problem has been a subject of extensive research over the years, yet the best constant approximation ratio has remained same at 2 (and the currently best performance ratio for the VC problem is 2 log log n log n <ref> [2, 13] </ref>). <p> Our approach is based on the "local approximation" principle, which in a most simple form appeared already in the Gavril's maximal matching approximation for the unweighted VC problem (cited in [6, page 134]) and which was explicitly formalized as the local ratio theorem by Bar-Yehuda and Even in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Such properties will then be used to show next that its weight is indeed guaranteed to be within twice that of the optimal solution. The basis of our algorithm and its analysis is an approximation principle suggested in the following generalization of local ratio theorem of Bar-Yehuda and Even <ref> [2] </ref>: Theorem 1 (Local Ratio Theorem) For G = (V; E; w) let fw i ; i = 1; ; kg be a de composition of w and F be any FVS in G s.t. w (F ) = P i w i (F ).

Reference-contexts: The minimum FVS for the graph gives a bound on the number of registers needed. See Bar-Yehuda et al. <ref> [3] </ref> for other applications in the areas of constraint satisfaction problems and Bayesian inference. Unfortunately, the feedback vertex set problem is NP-hard; for directed graphs Karp showed its NP-completeness even if graphs are unweighted [9], and essentially the same transformation shows that it is equally hard for undirected graphs. <p> It was later improved to p by Monien and Schulz in 1981 [12] who considered and compared various approaches to the problem. Only recently, Bar-Yehuda, Geiger, Naor and Roth were able to show that the smallest cardinality FVS can be approximated within constant ratio of 4 <ref> [3] </ref>. Moreover, they also considered the weighted version and in this case they obtained a performance ratio of minf4 log n; 2 2 g where is the maximum vertex degree of a graph. <p> of this principle, however, has been usually limited to extraction of subgraphs of "uniform" weights from either unweighted or weighted graphs; e.g., Bar-Yehuda et al. applied the theorem in extracting short cycles in uniform weights to obtain the aforementioned performance ratio of O (log n) for the weighted FVS problem <ref> [3] </ref>. Important technical contributions of this paper include a generalization of this theorem and demonstration of the effectiveness resulting from more flexible applications of it; i.e., we show that significantly better approximations can be achieved by "choosing" weights of our own for local structures. <p> It is also useful to observe that the ear reduction strictly generalizes both branchy reduction of <ref> [3] </ref> (the case of jAj = 2) and semi-disjoint cycle reduction of Section 3. Another easy observation is that degree-2 vertices form an independent set when the ear reduction is not applicable anymore.

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm is quite efficient and it can be implemented to run in time O (jEj+jV j log jV j), using the same data structures as Dijkstra's single-source shortest paths algorithm. Recently, Becker and Geiger <ref> [4] </ref> also show a performance of 2 with a different analysis that does not easily extend to the bounded degree case. It is also worth noting that achieving a performance ratio better than 2 might be com-putationally hard.

Reference-contexts: The first nontrivial approximation ratio of log n was obtained early by Erdos and Posa for unweighted graphs with n vertices <ref> [5] </ref> when they studied the number of (vertex) disjoint cycles in a graph. It was later improved to p by Monien and Schulz in 1981 [12] who considered and compared various approaches to the problem.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is based on the "local approximation" principle, which in a most simple form appeared already in the Gavril's maximal matching approximation for the unweighted VC problem (cited in <ref> [6, page 134] </ref>) and which was explicitly formalized as the local ratio theorem by Bar-Yehuda and Even in [2].

Reference-contexts: See an excellent survey in <ref> [7] </ref> on the account of recent (very successful) development of this approach to NP-hard optimization (and network design in particular) problems. We also study good approximation of the weighted FVS problem restricted to graphs of bounded vertex degree . This version remains NP-hard as well as MAX SNP-hard when 4.

Reference-contexts: It will be then shown that a performance ratio improves to 2 2 32 . Currently the best algorithm approximates the minimum weight VC in bounded degree graphs within a factor of 2 3 2+4 <ref> [8] </ref>. It remains an open question whether one can approximate the FVS problem with exactly the same ratio as the ones for the VC problem, whether the degree is bounded or not. The paper is structured as follows. <p> Somewhat intricate reasoning on the effects resulting from their interplay will give ratio 2 2 32 , strictly less than 2 for any constant . As remarked in Introduction the currently best performance ratio - 9 - for the bounded degree (weighted) VC problem is 2 3 2+4 <ref> [8] </ref>. It should be noted, however, that the approaches taken in approximation of these two problems are quite distinct; ours is an extension of the local approximation for a general problem while the one in [8] cannot be generalized to an unbounded degree version. <p> ratio - 9 - for the bounded degree (weighted) VC problem is 2 3 2+4 <ref> [8] </ref>. It should be noted, however, that the approaches taken in approximation of these two problems are quite distinct; ours is an extension of the local approximation for a general problem while the one in [8] cannot be generalized to an unbounded degree version. We first examine why the algorithm of Section 3 does no better in the present case. The bottleneck for a better performance of our algorithm is the ratio given in Lemma 5.

Confronted with this (apparent) intractability we are lead to a next best approach: a polynomial time algorithm for computing a near optimal FVS.
