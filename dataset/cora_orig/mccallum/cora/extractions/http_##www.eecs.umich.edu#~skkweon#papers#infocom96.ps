Abstract: Future integrated services networks are expected to carry various types of traffic including real-time packet video for which stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements must be met. In this paper, we propose a cell multiplexing scheme for providing real-time communication services in point-to-point ATM networks. Our scheme is simple enough to be used in high-speed ATM networks, yet reasonably efficient in terms of accommodating channel requests. The scheme employs the leaky bucket model as the input traffic description model and regulates the input traffic at User Network Interface (UNI) to comply with the input traffic specification. Inside the network ATM switches provide bounded local delays to individual cells using a traffic controller and a non-preemptive rate-monotonic priority scheduler.

Reference-contexts: The opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the view of the funding agencies. Among these performance parameters, delay is considered as the most important parameter in real-time communication services <ref> [1] </ref>, since the cell error rate can be kept very low with the use of advanced networking technologies. Especially, real-time communication services require each cell delivery delay, not the average delay, as a QoS requirement.

Reference-contexts: Note that the channel admissibility of TCRM is very close to that of PGPS while that of RCSP is not very good. In this example, we have verified that all four schemes show different degrees of channel admissibility. The difference among RTC, RCSP 3 and PGPS 3 Delay-EDD <ref> [5] </ref> is omitted in this comparison, since it shares many similarities with RTC and RCSP. In particular, it shares the same input traffic specification with RCSP.

Reference-contexts: It holds the incoming cells until their supposed arrival times, and then transfers them into the scheduler.

The logical arrival time of an incoming cell is calculated based on that of the previous cell of the same channel. <p> The second and third terms are the sum of the maximum queueing delays and the sum of propagation delays, respectively. Our approach shares the same idea of splitting the traffic controllers and the scheduler to provide the bounded link delays in Rate Controlled Static Priority Queueing (RCSP) <ref> [6] </ref>. Since TCRM allocate a differ-ent priority level to each real-time channel, they can provide arbitrary link delay bounds, whereas RCSP provides a preset finite number of link delay bounds. <p> wide range of bandwidths in TCRM at the expense of more complex channel management. 3 Comparative Evaluation of Channel Admissibility To show the efficiency of TCRM, we present a simple numerical example which compares the channel admissibility of our scheme and three other schemes, i.e., Real-Time Channel (RTC) [9], RCSP <ref> [6] </ref> and PGPS with real compressed video sequences. The reason why we choose the three schemes is that TCRM shows a similarity to RTC and RCSP in terms of structure and that PGPS shows the best efficiency in terms of channel admissibility [11]. <p> RCSP, RTC and PGPS adopted (X min ; X ave ; I; P ), (S max , R max , B max ) and ( i , i ) models, respectively <ref> [6, 8, 9] </ref>. <p> TCRM consists of two components: traffic controller and scheduler. The scheduler employs a fixed-priority scheduler. The simplicity of the traffic controller is very important, considering that the priority scheduler is not a complex component. Zhang and Ferrari <ref> [6] </ref> proposed use of a modified version of calendar queue as the rate-controller whose function is very similar to the traffic controller. The calendar queue can be used to implement the traffic controller of TCRM.

For RCSP, we assume here only one priority level with a local delay bound of 1/30 sec, because the characteristics of all the channels are assumed to be homogeneous. Zhang [19] derived the local delay bound for the case when the average link utilization does not exceed 1.

Reference-contexts: For PGPS, we derive ( i ; i ) in the same way as TCRM, except that i is obtained by dividing the link speed by the number of channels. This is because PGPS has only the link utilization test for its admission control. Using the formula in <ref> [13] </ref>, we calculate the end-to-end delay bounds. Given the user-requested bound 1/3 sec, up to 22 channels can be established. With RTC, we can establish 11 channels based on the schedulability test in [9].

Reference-contexts: In order to prevent the unbounded accumulation of cells in the scheduler, we must provide the minimum throughput i to this channel. The minimum cell inter-arrival time and cell delay bound are therefore given by L= i . Liu and Layland <ref> [17] </ref> proved that the rate-monotonic priority scheduling is optimal among all fixed-priority scheduling policies when the deadline of each task is the same as the period of each task. <p> So, we employ the rate-monotonic priority scheduler for transmitting cells. This scheduling policy assigns higher priority to channels with higher request rates, i.e., higher i .

The non-preemptive rate monotonic priority scheduler assigns a priority level to each real-time channel according to its required throughput and in-progress cell transmission will not be preempted. As a result, the scheduler provides the minimum throughput i to each channel i.
