Abstract: Aide is a knowledge-based planning assistant for intelligent data exploration that draws on research in mixed-initiative planning and collaborative systems. Aide incrementally explores a dataset, guided by user directives and its own evaluation of the data. The system is mixed-initiative: it semi-autonomously pursues high- and low-level goals but allows the user to review and potentially override its decisions. This paper briefly describes the exploratory task, Aide's architecture, and how the system interacts with the user. The bulk of the paper is devoted to an experiment in which we compared the performance of human subjects analyzing data with and without Aide. Although subjects each worked with Aide for only a few hours, the system clearly influenced the efficiency and coherence of their exploration. We surmise that Aide facilitates data analysis primarily by helping analysts navigate through the large space of decisions involved in exploring a dataset.

Reference-contexts: Aide, an Assistant for Intelligent Data Exploration, is a knowledge-based planning system that incrementally explores a dataset, guided by user directives and its own evaluation of indications in the data. As a mixed-initiative planning system <ref> (Allen 1994) </ref>, Aide must assist in an exploration, rather than taking over the process completely or waiting for instructions for each of its actions. Aide balances autonomy and accommodation within a partial hierarchical planning framework, which generates an explicit representation of the exploration process for the user's review and modification.

Reference-contexts: These models were constructed using causal modeling techniques comparable to those in the literature, such as Pearl's IC (Pearl & Verma 1991) and Spirtes et al.'s PC (Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 1993), modified when necessary to reflect our understanding of the variables and relationships involved <ref> (Cohen 1995) </ref>. We have eliminated TotalOp-erations from this model, because, as we know, it is a linear function of the other three variables. The relationship between NavigationOperations and Local-Operations is relatively strong (r = 0:67), as is the relationship between NavigationOperations and Ma-nipulationOperations (r = 0:54).

Reference-contexts: EDA is hard for a human analyst to do alone, but because it requires informed, human judgment, complete automation of the process is not feasible either. To solve this problem a system must strike a balance between autonomy and accommodation, where "accommodation" means a responsiveness to knowledgeable human guidance <ref> (Lubinsky & Pregibon 1988) </ref>. For the past several years we have been working on a system to help people with EDA. <p> Aide owes a debt to earlier systems developed to explore the concepts of statistical strategy.

Reference-contexts: These variables are related as shown in the model in represent features of the system (in the User+Aide condition), and arcs represent causal influences between them.

Collaborative systems generally face a number of difficult problems, including being able to reason about shared goals and context, deciding how to allocate responsibilities, and communicating about coordination and evaluation <ref> (Terveen 1995) </ref>. Some of these problems are alleviated in Aide by the partial hierarchical planning approach and the constraints of the domain. For example, as a general purpose system Aide is designed to have no knowledge of subject-matter context|what the data mean.
