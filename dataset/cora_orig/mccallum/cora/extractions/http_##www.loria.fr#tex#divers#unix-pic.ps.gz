Reference-contexts: In particular, pic is much more procedurala picture is drawn by specifying (sometimes in painful detail) the motions that one goes through to draw it. Other direct influences include the PICTURE language [2], the V viewgraph language <ref> [1] </ref>, and, more recently, new features from the grap language [3] for typesetting graphs. This paper is primarily a user's manual for pic; a discussion of design issues and user experience may be found in [6]. The next section shows how to use pic in the most simple way.

Theo Pavlidis contributed the basic spline algorithm; Eric Grosse provided code to compute the bounding box of an arc. Charles Wetherell pointed out reference <ref> [2] </ref> to me, and made several valuable criticisms on an early draft of the language and manual. The exposition in this manual has been greatly improved by suggestions from Jim Blinn and Mark Miller.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Pic is a language for drawing pictures. It operates as yet another troff [8] preprocessor (in the same style as eqn [7] and tbl <ref> [4] </ref>), with pictures delimited by .PS and .PE. Pic was inspired partly by Chris Van Wyk's early work on ideal [9]; it has somewhat the same capabilities, but quite a different flavor.

Reference-contexts: Pic does not center the complete drawing itself, but the default definitions of .PS and .PE in the -ms macro package do. __________________ This is a revised version of <ref> [5] </ref>. - 2 - You can use circle or ellipse in place of box: this is a box this is a box Text is centered on lines and arrows; if there is more than one line of text, the lines are centered above and below: line "this is" "a line" this
