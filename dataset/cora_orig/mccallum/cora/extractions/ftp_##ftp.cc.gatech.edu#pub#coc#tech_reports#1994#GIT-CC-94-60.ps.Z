Abstract: It has been known for several years now that variable-bit-rate video sources are strongly auto-correlated. Recently, several studies have indicated that the resulting stochastic processes exhibit long-range dependence properties. This implies that large buffers at intermediate switching points may not provide adequate delay performance for such classes of traffic in Broadband packet-switched networks (such as ATM). In this paper, we study the effect of long-memory processes on queue length statistics of a single queue system through a controlled fractionally differenced ARIMA(1; d; 0) input process. This process has two parameters 1 (0 1 1) and d (0 d &lt; 1=2) representing an auto-regressive component and a long-range dependent component, respectively. Results show that the queue length statistics studied (mean, variance and the 0:999 quantile) are proportional to e c 1 1 e c 2 d ; where (c 1 ; c 2 ) are positive constants, and c 2 &gt; c 1 : The effect of the auto-correlation structure on queue length statistics is also critically dependent on the tail of the distribution of the input process. Therefore, multiplexing gains can be achieved for long-range dependent processes because the resulting process has a tighter tail distribution. Given these observations, and the need to provide guaranteed maximum-delay and delay-jitter bounds, and low cell-loss probabilities to applications, the solution appears to be (a) allocating higher rates if the distribution tails are large, (b) using multiplexing to narrow these tails, (c) applying a per circuit frame-clock in conjunction with an active cell-discard strategy to deal with long-range dependence. Strategy (c) is a version of the Stop and Go queueing that does not require tight deterministic rate specifications, but provides maximum-delay and delay-jitter bounds over multiple hops as in the original proposal. The combined strategy is a hybrid between packet switching and circuit switching technology.

Reference-contexts: Since we shall be using these processes extensively, a brief overview of the process is given below. ARIMA (p; d; q) models, with d = 0; 1; 2; : : : were popularized by Box and Jenkins <ref> [1] </ref> for purposes of modeling time series data. Letting fX t g denote the observations from a stationary process with zero mean. <p> In any case, both of them will show a dramatic increase in queue lengths (mean, variance and various tail quantiles). 6 Increasing 1 increases the short-range dependence in the resulting process. 1 should be less than 1:0; however, if the resulting process is to be stationary <ref> [1] </ref>. Increasing d from 0:0 to 0:4 will result in processes with larger long-range dependence components.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that correlated input traffic dramatically increases the queue length statistics at a multiplexor [16, 17, 19], and new experimental results based on shu*ed (randomized) Ethernet traffic data indicate that the impact of long-range dependence is significantly larger than that of short-range dependence <ref> [5] </ref>. However, precise estimates of queue length tail distributions are needed, and these appear extremely non-trivial to obtain. A recent study [25] indicates that for a Fractional Brownian Motion input process, the buffer occupancy is approximately Weibull distributed.

The Hurst coefficient, H; defined as (1 fi=2); was estimated in <ref> [8] </ref> as between 0:75 and 0:88: An implication is that, even if traffic were aggregated over long time periods, the net aggregate will not appear as white noise. Instead, the aggregate will have bursty sub-periods and less bursty sub-periods for small as well as large time-scales. <p> Compare this to the more general process given by (13). 1 was varied from 0:0 to 0:8 in steps of 0:2; and d was varied from 0:0 to 0:4 in steps of 0:1: The MPEG-I coded "starwars" trace was reported to to have an estimated d between 0:28 and 0:38 <ref> [8] </ref>. Observe that a change in d also causes a change in the short-range dependence structure. The overall effect on queue statistics, however, will be found to factor out into separate components. Therefore, the confounding of correlations at smaller lags (between 1 and d) will not be a problem. <p> For a Gamma distribution, a smaller s corresponds to a heavier tail and a larger coefficient of variation (= 1= p Long-range dependent processes with Gamma marginals were generated using the heuristic algorithm similar to that described in <ref> [8] </ref>: (a) An F-ARIMA (1; d; 0) process, fX t g; was generated first (as in earlier simulations); (b) The fX t g were mapped to a new process fY t g such that P (X &gt; X t ) was equal to P (Y &gt; Y t ); i.e., the

The objectives of this paper may, therefore, be summarized as follows. (a) To investigate the impact of a long-memory process and its tail distribution on queue length statistics. <p> Computing tight bounds on the delay statistics for a multiplexed real-time stream seems to be non-trivial. Next consider some of the benefits of active cell-discard at each switch after an application specified frame time, T: (i) In conjunction with Stop-and-Go queuing <ref> [9] </ref>, where cells belonging to frame i are not eligible for service until frame-time i + 1; all delivered cells are guaranteed a delay jitter bound equal to jT j; and a maximum delay bound through the network equal to 3HT + C; where H is the number of hops in <p> The proposed scheme has not yet been implemented, so what follows should be considered preliminary. The key idea for guaranteeing delay-jitter bounds using Golestani's Stop-and-Go queuing <ref> [9] </ref> is to induce a framing strategy on top of the ATM cells of a given virtual circuit, and for the 18 switch to actively discard (or mark as old), cells that are not serviced during the cells' allocated frame time. <p> Frame synchronization issues in the presence of propagation delay have been addressed by Golestani <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> FCFS server, a priority structure allowing for higher priority to certain cells over others for applications using multi-level compression algorithms, dynamic bandwidth allocation across virtual circuits 1 This may have to be relaxed to one more frame if perfect frame synchronization is achieved through an extra delay circuitry proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>. The implementation would then require two bits to identify the frame instead of one. 20 based on past history and predicted future needs, etc. The exact strategy is beyond the scope of this paper.) 6 Open Issues The primary open issue is scheduling active cells. <p> and (ii) the framing structure protects packets in future frames from being delayed by packets in previous ones even if the arrival process is long-range dependent; 21 * It provides for maximum delay and delay-jitter bounds for any network topology, in accor-dance with the objectives of Stop and Go queuing <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Recent studies on a range of video applications indicate that there exists a long-range dependence structure in the underlying stochastic processes that constitute VBR video applications <ref> [2, 7, 26] </ref>. It appears that different compression schemes can change this correlation structure somewhat; however, the dominant dependence structures imposed by applications remain. Providing QoS guarantees for real-time traffic is an active area of research, see for instance [6, 9, 15, 32]. <p> Queue lengths for real VBR video traffic may turn out to be larger than our simulation numbers show because the fractionally differenced ARIMA process generates innovations that are Gaussian, and the distribution of real VBR video has a larger tail in its distribution <ref> [26] </ref>. Therefore, it appears that (i) buffering traffic without an active cell-discard mechanism can lead to excessive delays and losses for future cells; and 2 (ii) determining equivalent bandwidths without active cell-discard will remain a difficult prob-lem, at least in the near future. <p> Section 5 discusses preliminary ideas on efficient implementation of the protocol and Section 8 presents the conclusions. 2 Background On Short-Range and Long-Range Dependence Workload characterization for variable bit-rate (VBR) video is an active area of research, see for example <ref> [2, 7, 26, 30] </ref>. The studies in [2, 7, 26] show that the traffic induced by a single VBR video source is strongly auto-correlated. Further, there exists a long-range dependence, or equivalently, a persistence in their correlation structure that does not die out even for large lags. <p> Section 5 discusses preliminary ideas on efficient implementation of the protocol and Section 8 presents the conclusions. 2 Background On Short-Range and Long-Range Dependence Workload characterization for variable bit-rate (VBR) video is an active area of research, see for example [2, 7, 26, 30]. The studies in <ref> [2, 7, 26] </ref> show that the traffic induced by a single VBR video source is strongly auto-correlated.

Studies by Beran et al, Garrett and Willinger and Pancha and El Zarki <ref> [2, 8, 26] </ref> indicate that long-range dependence is to be expected in variable-bit-rate video traffic. <p> We next show some preliminary results of the impact of a heavier tailed distribution on queue statistics. We select a Gamma distribution because it has been reported to fit VBR video traces <ref> [26] </ref>. Investigation into heavier tailed distributions are currently in progress. The Gamma density function is given by: f (x) = e x= (x=) s ; x 0; &gt; 0; s &gt; 0; where and s are the scale and shape parameters, respectively.

Reference-contexts: pros and cons of these schedulers are as follows. * Pros: hardware implementations for several of these algorithms exist and serve as proof of concept. * Cons: providing different loss probabilities to different applications in a controlled fashion is non-trivial.

This enhances upon the Weighted Fair Queuing algorithm by adjusting the weights dynamically according to a prescribed optimization objective. (c) Multi-level priority structure that splits traffic from individual circuits into multiple priority classes and schedules higher priority packets ahead of lower priority ones.
