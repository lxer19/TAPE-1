Title: Learning 2D Shape Models  
Date: 228  
Pubnum: CVPR'99  
Abstract: A new fully automated shape learning method is presented. It is based on clustering a set of training shapes in the original shape space and performing a Procrustes analysis on each cluster to obtain cluster prototypes and information about shape variation. The main difference from previously reported methods is that the training set is first automatically clustered and those shapes considered to be outliers are discarded. The second difference is in the manner in which registered sets of points are extracted from each shape contour. As a direct application of our shape learning method, an 11-structure shape model of brain substructures was extracted from MR image data, an eigen-shape model was automatically trained, and employed to segment several MR brain images not present in the shape-training set. A quantitative analysis of our shape registration approach within the main cluster of each structure, demonstrated results that compare very well to those achieved by manual registration; achieving an average rms error of about 1 pixel. Our approach can serve as a fully automated substitute to the tedious and time-consuming manual shape registration and analysis.

Reference-contexts: This variation is used by the segmentation method to reject shape deformations that have not been seen in the training set (see <ref> [3] </ref>). V. Experimental Results The shape learning method presented above was employed to design a shape model for 11 brain structures and its performance was assessed by a quantitative comparison to a "ground truth" model obtained manually. <p> On the average, all rms errors are between 0:71:2 pixels. For some structures the automatic method produced a slightly smaller rms distance than the manual one, while for others the rms is slightly larger. We employed the automatically extracted prototypes to train a Point Distribution Model (PDM) <ref> [3] </ref> and segment 11 neuroanatomical structures. Note that Algorithm 1 not only gives an average shape and variation for each cluster, but also the registration of the cluster prototype to all shapes in the cluster.

Reference-contexts: In order to ensure that the shape variation present in the original data is preserved, one needs a precise automatic registration method. Hill et al. <ref> [12] </ref> reported a mean-square-error from a ground truth about twice as Fig. 2. <p> Consecutive point clouds are drawn in different colors to show that the clouds are nonoverlapping; the registration appears to be very precise. In order to obtain a quantitative validation of our results, we used the method employed in <ref> [12] </ref>. From each structure prototype, we manually selected several points we considered most important in defining its shape (the points with the highest curvature) and we manually registered them to the training images.

Reference-contexts: A convenient way for obtaining shape clusters based on D which is also helpful for cluster prototype (average) computation is a k-means type clustering algorithm <ref> [15] </ref>: 1. Find a seed which is closest to the data. This is done in Step 4a of Algorithm 1 by finding the shape approximation S 0 i 0 that best fits the current training set (based on the average distance to the rest of the shapes).

Reference-contexts: a cluster), then one can say that, by transitivity, s i 1 ; s i 2 ; ::; s i m are correspondents on S 1 ; ::; S m of one vertex of an average shape (the idea of registration by transitivity was previously used by Sclaroff and Pent-land <ref> [17] </ref>, though in a different context). It is not advisable to register two polygonal approximations because one can loose the original point variation and encounter contention problems caused by the one-to-one mapping requirement. <p> They also reported that other methods were even less robust.
