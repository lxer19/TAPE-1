Reference-contexts: Many parallel algorithms have also been proposed for this problem; a representative sample would include (Levialdi, 1972), (Lim, 1987), (Lim et al., 1987), <ref> (Agrawal and Nekludova, 1987) </ref>, (Bader and JaJa, 1994), and (Johl, 1994). For a comparative survey, see (Greiner, 1993). Serial algorithms remain of interest for implementation on sequential hardware. The source, test images, and results for this project will be made available at http://www.ai.mit.edu/~mfoltz/6.866/.

Reference-contexts: Yang's algorithm is specific to the binary case. Other classes of algorithms for this problem trace the boundaries of connected components <ref> (Danielsson, 1982) </ref>, or grow connected components from a "seed" pixel (Manohar and Ramapriyan, 1989). This algorithm is most similar to one invented by Rosenfeld and Pfaltz (Rosenfeld and Pfaltz, 1966) that uses label equivalences computed during a first pass to label components during a second pass.

Graphical Models and Image Processing, </title> <booktitle> 55(6) </booktitle> <pages> 532-537, </pages> <month> Novem-ber </month> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: For a survey of histogram-based thresholding techniques, see <ref> (Glasbey, 1993) </ref>. As thresholding was used only to obtain binary images as input for the connected components algorithm, adjusting the thresholding parameter by hand for the suite of test images was sufficient for this project. The thresholding techniques discussed above assumed an image with one brightness value per pixel.
