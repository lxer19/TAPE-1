Abstract: We introduce a new file organization for the storage and manipulation of spatial (or multidimensional) data that is able to execute spatial join operations with great efficiency. The Filter Tree information structure is a hierarchical organization that tends to separate spatial entities by size, placing larger entities at the higher levels of the Filter Tree, and smaller entities at lower levels. Within each level, index entries for the entities are ordered by a space-filling curve (Hilbert curve). This allows the algorithms to use bulk I/O requests, exploiting the locality in the index information, and minimizing the number of I/O transfers from disk. We provide algorithms for constructing Filter Trees, for performing range queries on a Filter Tree, and for performing spatial joins between a pair of Filter Trees. Finally, we include results from experiments using a prototype implementation of Filter Trees to treat both synthetic and real sets of spatial entities. Our experimental results show that full spatial joins can always be done more efficiently with Filter Trees than with current competitive methods, and that in some cases the improvement in performance is very large.

Reference-contexts: In an enhanced implementation, Filter Trees can have fanout up to three times bigger than that of R-trees. For comparison with the Filter Tree join algorithm, we implemented the best R-tree join algorithm proposed by Brinkhoff et al. <ref> [BKS93] </ref>. The R-tree join algorithm involves an index sweeping process. When the indexes have the same height, the algorithm proceeds top-down sweeping index blocks at the same height.

Reference-contexts: Because of the overlap in the index entries, the organization and grouping of data into blocks has great impact on the performance of the method.

Reference-contexts: Six and Widmeyer used size separation to extend grid files to represent hyper-rectangles rather than points [SW88].

Reference-contexts: Space partitioning approaches impose a regular decomposition of the space. A very popular way to organize and access multidimensional objects is the R-tree <ref> [Gut84] </ref>. In an R-tree, multidimensional objects are represented by their Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBR), which may over lap. Consequently the R-tree does not impose any decomposition in the space.

Fortunately, the two basic mechanisms of the Filter Tree, namely binary recursive partitioning and Hilbert curve ordering, both generalize to higher dimensions <ref> [Jag90] </ref>. Because the number of cells at level j in a k dimensional Filter Tree is 2 kj , however, the number of levels that it is practical to use decreases as k increases.

Reference-contexts: Spatial joins find many applications in GIS and they are particularly useful in spatial data mining applications <ref> [NH94] </ref>. Join processing proceeds in two steps. The first step, identifies a list of candidate pairs that might qualify to be in the output. This set is derived based on the partial evaluation of the predicate with the information included in the entity descriptors.

Reference-contexts: Typical queries for multidimensional access methods are range queries, nearest neighbor queries and spatial joins. Spatial Access Methods have been an active area of research over the years. They can be categorized as either entity-grouping or space-partitioning <ref> [Sam90] </ref>. With the entity grouping approach, the way in which entities are clustered and stored in blocks is determined by what items are stored and the order in which they are inserted. Space partitioning approaches impose a regular decomposition of the space. <p> Space filling curves [Jag90] have been used for clustering multidimensional objects.
