Abstract: The paper presents an overview of the Spoken Language Translator (SLT) system's hybrid language-processing architecture, focussing on the way in which rule-based and statistical methods are combined to achieve robust and efficient performance within a linguistically motivated framework. In general, we argue that rules are desirable in order to encode domain-independent linguistic constraints and achieve high-quality grammatical output, while corpus-derived statistics are needed if systems are to be efficient and robust; further, that hybrid architectures are superior from the point of view of portability to architectures which only make use of one type of information. We address the topics of "multi-engine" strategies for robust translation; robust bottom-up parsing using pruning and grammar specialization; rational development of linguistic rule-sets using balanced domain corpora; and efficient supervised training by interactive disambiguation. All work described is fully implemented in the current version of the SLT-2 system.

Reference-contexts: The CLE [2] is a general language-processing system which has been developed at SRI Cambridge under a series of projects starting in 1986. Versions exist for English, Swedish [11], French and Spanish [20]; several other languages are under development. SLT <ref> [17, 1] </ref> is a speech translation system which uses the CLE as its language processing component. The current version of SLT is configured to translate between English, Swedish and French in the ATIS [13] domain, employing a vocabulary of about 1500 words.

Reference-contexts: The results show a clear improvement over those pro duced by the surface methods alone. The work we describe here is based on the SRI Core Language Engine (CLE) and the Spoken Language Translator (SLT), both of which have been extensively described elsewhere. The CLE <ref> [2] </ref> is a general language-processing system which has been developed at SRI Cambridge under a series of projects starting in 1986. Versions exist for English, Swedish [11], French and Spanish [20]; several other languages are under development.

Reference-contexts: Translation is performed using two different methods. The first is itself a hybrid method which combines unification-based rules and statistical preferences <ref> [3, 18] </ref>. The rules suggest candidate translations, which are then ordered by the statistical preferences. The basic division of effort is that rules encode domain-independent grammatical phenomena, while the preferences take care of problems concerning lexical choice, which are usually to some extent domain-dependent.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, a discriminant will be both user-friendly and system-friendly, but this is not essential. We have developed an interactive program, the Tree-Banker <ref> [4] </ref>, which maintains a database of the discrim-inants that apply to the different analyses of each sentence in a corpus. It presents discriminants to the user in a convenient graphical form.

Reference-contexts: Our work on parsing (see [19] for a fuller description, albeit one based on a slightly earlier version of the system) is a logical continuation of two specific strands of research aimed in this general direction. The first is the popular idea of statistical tagging e.g. <ref> [9, 6, 5] </ref>. Here, the basic idea is that a given small segment S of the input string may have several possible analyses; in particular, if S is a single word, it may potentially be any one of several parts of speech.
