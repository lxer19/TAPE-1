Reference-contexts: The goals of this project are to represent the axioms of graph theory, explore what can be proved given the axioms, and prove theorems using an automated theorem prover. Approach Some work has already been done for representing graph theoretic properties in Mathematica <ref> [2] </ref>. Building on this work, and other representations to be researched in the library, representations of graph theory axioms for the Larch Prover (LP) will be created. LP provides a number of proof techniques and utilities, such as Knuth-Bendix completion, for exploring the consequences of axiom systems.
