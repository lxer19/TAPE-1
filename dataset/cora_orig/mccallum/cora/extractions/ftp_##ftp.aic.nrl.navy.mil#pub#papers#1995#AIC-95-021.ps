Reference-contexts: The model contains five simulated states of understanding (SSOU): busy, buffering, ready, processing, and reporting. Each SSOU feedback state is intended to produce conversational behavior on the part of the user similar to that produced by the corresponding SOU <ref> [2] </ref>. The feedback model prescribes the type of feedback to be provided based on its conversational purpose but not the specific form in which it must be provided. The principles defined in the feedback model will be evaluated with a formal evaluation.

Reference-contexts: The listener provides evidence of his/her SOU thus allowing the speaker to adapt according to the specific SOU. If a SOU is not clearly communicated by the listener, the speaker will seek further evidence that the communication was received; that is the speaker seeks extra evidence to achieve grounding <ref> [4] </ref>. This process provides the starting point for the proposed model of feedback for graphical interaction techniques.

Reference-contexts: It is this exibility in the ow of human dialogue that we would like to achieve in human-computer dialogues. The theory of contributions to conversations, as presented in [2-4], has already been applied in the study of human-computer dialogues. In <ref> [5] </ref>, Payne analyzes the interaction in MacDraw based on presentation/acceptance trees. Bren-nan and Hulteen have defined a model of adaptive speech feedback [6] based on the states of understanding (SOU) principles.

Reference-contexts: The theory of contributions to conversations, as presented in [2-4], has already been applied in the study of human-computer dialogues. In [5], Payne analyzes the interaction in MacDraw based on presentation/acceptance trees. Bren-nan and Hulteen have defined a model of adaptive speech feedback <ref> [6] </ref> based on the states of understanding (SOU) principles. The work described here uses the SOU principles as the basis for a feedback model for graphical interaction, such as click-and-drag operations. SOU is one of many ways participants in conversations fulfill their goals in a collaborative process. <p> The extension divides the processing and reporting states into three new states: intending, acting, and reporting, similar to what is proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>. But here, these states are used to allow the user to interrupt and cancel dialogue threads in a multi-threaded dialogue. A prototype of the dialogue controller for a UIMS will be built based on this extension.
