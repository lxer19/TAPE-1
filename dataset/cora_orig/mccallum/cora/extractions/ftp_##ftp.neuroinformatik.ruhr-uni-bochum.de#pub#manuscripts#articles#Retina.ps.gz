Abstract: The development of the synaptic connections between two neural fields (e.g. retina and tectum) from an undifferentiated initial state toward a topological projection is described by an appropriate system of differential equations. The equations are based simply on cooperative and competitive interactions between the individual synaptic contacts. In the case of one-dimensional fields it is shown that the system is able to select either of the two possible orientations and to produce a precise topological projection. This is done with the methods of synergetics: Linear analysis near the initial state, classification of the linear modes into principal and ancillary, adiabatic elimination of the latter from the original system and discussion of the resulting equations.

Reference-contexts: In the adult animal, however, the retino-tectal connections are arranged retinotopically, i.e. neighbouring retinal cells project through their fibres onto neighbouring cells of the tectum. It follows that there must be some mechanism for rearranging the initially disordered contacts (for a review see Gaze <ref> (1978) </ref>). A sorting mechanism which solves the problem has been presented in v.d. Malsburg and Willshaw (1977) and Willshaw and v.d. Malsburg (1979). <p> Malsburg (1981)). The differential equations are introduced in sections 2 and 3. In section 4 we give an outline of the treatment, which is carried out in detail in the subsequent sections 5, 6 and 7, where we make use of the methods of synergetics (see Haken <ref> (1978) </ref>). 2 The analytical model As the treatment of the two dimensional case, although possible, would be rather involved, let us assume that retina and tectum both are one-dimensional chains. We assume furthermore that these chains contain the same number N of cells.

Reference-contexts: It follows that there must be some mechanism for rearranging the initially disordered contacts (for a review see Gaze (1978)). A sorting mechanism which solves the problem has been presented in v.d. Malsburg and Willshaw (1977) and Willshaw and v.d. Malsburg <ref> (1979) </ref>. The essence of that theory is the following: Suppose that each fibre has already grown from retina to tectum and has built many synaptic contacts on the tectum. <p> To install a specific orientation (e.g. nasal retina projecting to caudal tectum) the symmetry between orientations has to be broken by an additional mechanism. A convenient way is to assume that the initial configuration of weights slightly favours this orientation (see Fig.4). In Willshaw and v.d. Malsburg <ref> (1979) </ref> extensive computer simulations have shown that a system based on these ideas indeed establishes retinotopy as final configuration. The simulations did also account for the many types of experiments involving perturbations of the normal case.
