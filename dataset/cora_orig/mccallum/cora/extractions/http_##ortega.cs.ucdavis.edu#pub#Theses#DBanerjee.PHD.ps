Reference-contexts: While it is difficult to predict future traffic characteristics, we believe that our approach provides a reasonable framework for analysis and design. 2.3.3 Simulated Annealing Simulated annealing (along with genetic algorithms) has been found to provide good solutions for optimization problems of this nature. In the simulated annealing process <ref> [1, 41, 52] </ref>, the algorithm starts with an initial random configuration for the virtual topology. Then, it goes through a series of node-exchange operations so as to provide a lower overall average packet delay for the network. <p> The "cooling" parameter is updated after every 100 acceptances to be 0.9 times the previous value of the parameter. A state is considered "frozen" when there is no improvement over 100 consecutive trials. For further information on simulated annealing, see <ref> [1, 41, 52] </ref>. 2.3.4 Flow Deviation Algorithm The flow assignment problem has been studied extensively in the networking literature. <p> 83 Chapter 5: WGR-Based Passive Optical Network 84 has a fixed cyclical-permutation-based routing matrix (interconnection pattern) between its input and output ports, e.g., wavelength k on input port i is always routed to the same wavelength on output port (i + k 2) modulo M + 1; 8i; k 2 <ref> [1; M ] </ref>. The physical topology of the network that we are considering here is a mesh-connected fiber plant with WGR-based routing nodes. Unidirectional fiber links connect the routing nodes, i.e., a fiber connects an output port of a node's WGR to an input port of an adjacent node's WGR. <p> = N. * WGR size = Number of wavelengths in the system = M. (All WGRs are of the same size.) * Traffic matrix: The variable T sd = 1 if we require a lightpath from node s to node d; T sd = 0 otherwise; where s; d 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref>. <p> Since a lightpath is assigned the value of its originating node, F m b ;n a 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter, we focus on studying routing and wavelength assignment of lightpaths in large WANs. This has been referred to as the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem in [82] and has been studied by others as well <ref> [2, 23, 92, 96] </ref>. If the intermediate optical switches through which the lightpath passes are equipped with wavelength converting devices, the wavelength-continuity constraint may be relaxed; otherwise this constraint may reduce the wavelength utilization in the network. The RWA problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer linear program [82]. <p> The results (with regard to congestion and number of wavelengths) in this study will depend on the order in which the connections arrive. For the DLE case, the Chapter 4: Routing & Wavelength Assignment 78 network is assumed to be wide-sense non-blocking <ref> [2] </ref>, i.e., existing connections are not rerouted so as to accommodate a new connection that is being blocked due to lack of free wavelengths. The set of connections are kept the same as in the static case. This approach provides a fair comparison between the static and the dynamic cases. <p> Section 5.4 concludes the chapter and discusses areas of future work. 5.1 Motivation, Challenges, and an Illustrative Example 5.1.1 Motivation A number of studies have been conducted on WDM network design using the WRS as a routing element in a mesh-connected network <ref> [2, 8, 27, 82, 96] </ref>. A WRS can independently route any wavelength from a given input port to any output port. <p> It is also shown in [10] that dN=2e + 2 wavelengths are sufficient for oblivious permutation routing in non-reconfigurable networks. * Existence and construction of non-reconfigurable permutation networks: It is shown in <ref> [2, 10] </ref> that there exist permutation networks that require O ( p wavelengths. The work in [2] also shows how to construct such a network, and the construction requires p N p (N ) wavelengths, where p (N ) = 2 (log N) 0:8+o (1) . <p> It is also shown in [10] that dN=2e + 2 wavelengths are sufficient for oblivious permutation routing in non-reconfigurable networks. * Existence and construction of non-reconfigurable permutation networks: It is shown in [2, 10] that there exist permutation networks that require O ( p wavelengths.

The following results on wavelength requirements, based on the congestion and dilation properties of routing algorithms, appeared in <ref> [2] </ref>. Let the congestion and dilation of a given routing scheme be c and d, respectively. An easy observation is that c fi d wavelengths are sufficient to achieve the routing scheme. The result is made stronger as follows.

Reference-contexts: A routing node in this wavelength-routed network architecture (Fig. 5.1) consists of an optical component for wavelength routing of all-optical lightpaths, and an electronic component for origination and termination of lightpaths, viz., electronic add-drop multiplexing, and for electronic switching (traffic forwarding) between lightpaths <ref> [3, 8, 45, 68, 82] </ref>. We employ a Waveguide Grating Router (WGR) [32] (explained in detail in Appendix A.7.2 as a passive wavelength router in the optical subcomponent of the routing node (see Fig. 5.1). <p> and Telegraph Company (AT&T), Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) have formed a precompetitive consortium for ARPA to address the challenges of utilizing the evolving Terahertz capability of optical fiber technology to develop a national information infrastucture capable of providing a flexible transport layer <ref> [3] </ref>. The main motivations for this architecture are the following. * The architecture should scale gracefully to accommodate thousands of nodes, and provide for a nationwide communication infrastructure. * The architecture should be "future-proof", i.e., modular and flexible to incor porate future developments in technology. The architecture, shown in Fig.

Reference-contexts: The outputs from those gates are passively combined to provide two possible outputs. The gating device is simply an on/off modulator which may be easier to implement than a gating device <ref> [4] </ref>. However, the gate switch has a 3 dB splitting loss on input and a 3 dB combining loss on output. These losses can be offset using optical amplifiers.

Reference-contexts: Similarly the lightpath on 0 from node A takes a long convoluted route 4 Optical cycles passing through optical amplifiers with a overall gain in the loop can create a lasing effect in the system <ref> [5] </ref>. Care must be taken to avoid this effect in the system architecture. Chapter 5: WGR-Based Passive Optical Network 90 before it finally terminates at node C. We would like to avoid such long convoluted lightpaths in our virtual topology.

A WRS can independently route any wavelength from a given input port to any output port. <p> Each crossbar switch can be configured in M ! ways; thus, the solution space consists of (M !) 2N solution points 6 . Moreover, routing and wavelength assignment of lightpaths in this architecture is hard to solve using traditional algorithms outlined in <ref> [8, 23] </ref>. Traditional routing algorithms based on the WRS exploit the fact that each wavelength may be routed independently of any other wavelength in a WRS.
