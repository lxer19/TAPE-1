Abstract: An unprecedented combination of simulative and metaphor-based reasoning about beliefs is achieved in an AI system, ATT-Meta. Much mundane discourse about beliefs uses conceptual metaphors (e.g., MIND AS CONTAINER) productively, and ATT-Meta's metaphor-based reasoning accordingly leads to crucial discourse comprehension decisions. ATT-Meta's non-metaphorical mode of belief reasoning includes simulative reasoning (SR). In ATT-Meta, metaphor-based reasoning can block and otherwise influence the course of SR. Also, ATT-Meta can nest SR and metaphor-based reasoning within themselves and each other. As well as currently allowing ATT-Meta to simulatively reason about beliefs about beliefs ..., the nesting will in the near future allow the system to handle chained metaphors, ascribe its own metaphor-based reasoning to other agents, and apply simulative reasoning to purely metaphorical agents.

Reference-contexts: For instance, one subregion can contain the thought that a recipe is wrong, whereas another can contain the thought that the recipe is right. Alternatively, thoughts in one sub-region can simply be absent from another. In (1c) we see the conceptual metaphor of IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES <ref> (following Barnden, 1992) </ref>. A thinking episode is portrayed as inner speech within the agent. We take IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES to be a special case of MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE, with the internal utterance being an event that takes place within the "space" of the agent's mind.

Reference-contexts: reasoning can be done simulatively as in ATT-Meta or otherwise. (Not all of ATT-Meta's belief reason is simulative: for instance, conclusions that an agent does not believe something are arrived at non-simulatively.) ATT-Meta is also one of the few detailed computational schemes for performing significant metaphor-based reasoning in discourse understanding <ref> (others are the schemes of Hobbs, 1990, and Martin, 1990) </ref>, as opposed to doing semantic analysis of metaphorical sentences.

Reference-contexts: this damned recipe's wrong." Consider also the immense potential for further varying these, e.g. using verbs other than "shove" and "whine." The most economical explanation of the sense that (1b 0 - c 0 ) and their further variants make is that they appeal to the metaphors we mentioned above <ref> (cf. the observations in Lakoff 1993) </ref>. Then, for uniformity and continuity, it is a short step to saying that (1b,c) also manifest those metaphors, though in a more pallid way. (1c) does differ markedly from (1c 0 ) in not using an ordinary verb of speech.
