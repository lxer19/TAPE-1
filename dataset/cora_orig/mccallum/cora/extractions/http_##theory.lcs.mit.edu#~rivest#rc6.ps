Abstract: fmatt,ray,yiqung@rsa.com Abstract. We introduce the RC6 TM block cipher. RC6 is an evolutionary improvement of RC5, designed to meet the requirements of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Like RC5, RC6 makes essential use of data-dependent rotations. New features of RC6 include the use of four working registers instead of two, and the inclusion of integer multiplication as an additional primitive operation. The use of multiplication greatly increases the diffusion achieved per round, allowing for greater security, fewer rounds, and increased throughput.

Reference-contexts: Of most importance may be block sizes of 256 bits which would take advantage of a word size of 64 bits and the performance offered by the next generation of system architectures (see for example <ref> [3, 6] </ref>). We note further that the structure of RC6 allows one to exploit a certain degree of parallelism in the encryption and decryption routines. For example, the computation of t and u at each round can be computed in parallel as can the updates of A and C.

Reference-contexts: Faster implementations may well be possible. 3.3 Estimates of performance on 8-bit platforms Here we give some crude estimates for the performance of RC6 on an 8-bit processor. In particular, we consider estimates for Intel's popular MCS 51 Mi-crocontroller family <ref> [5] </ref>. The estimates we shall make can be considered to hold for Phillips' 80C51 family of processors [16] as well, since these two families have very similar instruction sets and timings. Encryption/decryption. We first consider the round function of RC6 (see Section 2.2). <p> According to Intel <ref> [5] </ref> each cycle takes one microsecond on a typical MCS 51 processor, and so an estimate for the encryption speed of RC6 on this particular processor is around (1; 000; 000=13; 920) fi 128 = 9:2 Kbits/second.

Reference-contexts: We are aware of several potential enhancements to the essential attacks we have described (in particular, the use of truncated and higher-order differentials <ref> [9] </ref>), and we are also aware of some alternative approaches. However, all these techniques have so far failed to improve on the attacks outlined here, and we believe that all currently available sophisticated cryptanalytic attacks will require more data than there is available.
