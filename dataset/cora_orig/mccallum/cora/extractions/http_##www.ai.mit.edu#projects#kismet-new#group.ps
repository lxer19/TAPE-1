Abstract: We present a novel methodology for building humanlike artificially intelligent systems. We take as a model the only existing systems which are universally accepted as intelligent: humans. We emphasize building intelligent systems which are not masters of a single domain, but, like humans, are adept at performing a variety of complex tasks in the real world. Using evidence from cognitive science and neuroscience, we suggest alternative "essences of intelligence" to those held by classical AI: the parallel themes of development, social interaction, embodiment, and integration. Following a methodology based on these themes, we have built a physical humanoid robot. In this paper we present our methodology and the insights it affords for facilitating learning, simplifying the computation underlying rich behavior, and building systems that can scale to more complex tasks in more challenging environments.

Reference-contexts: Introduction An early development in the history of AI was the claim of Newell & Simon (1961) that humans use physical symbol systems to "think". Over time, this has become adopted into Artificial Intelligence as an implicit and dominant hypothesis (see <ref> (Brooks 1991a) </ref> for a review). A modern AI system generally relies on uniform, explicit, internal representations of capabilities of the system, the state of the outside world, and the desired goals.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, from a more engineering perspective, these themes make the problems of building human intelligence easier. Embodiment A principle tenet of our methodology is to build and test real robotic systems. We believe that building human-like intelligence requires human-like interaction with the world <ref> (Brooks & Stein 1994) </ref>. Humanoid form is important to allow humans to interact with the robot in a natural way. In addition we believe that building a real system is computationally less complex than simulating such a system.

Reference-contexts: Vision can cause auditory illusions too, for example in the McGurk effect <ref> (Cohen & Massaro 1990) </ref>. These studies demonstrate that hu mans' perception of their senses cannot be treated as completely independent processes. Methodology Our methodology|exploring themes of development, social interaction, physical interaction and integration while building real robots|is motivated by two ideas.

Reference-contexts: Further, humans often do not use subroutine-like rules for making decisions. They are often more emotional than rational, and there is evidence that this emotional content is an important aspect of decision making <ref> (Damasio 1994) </ref>. Essences of Human Intelligence Since humans are vastly complex systems we do not expect to duplicate every facet. However, we must be very careful not to ignore aspects of human intelligence solely because they appear complex.

We believe that these methods will allow us to construct systems which do scale autonomously <ref> (Ferrell & Kemp 1996) </ref>. Social Interaction Building social skills into an artificial intelligence provides not only a natural means of human-machine interaction but also a mechanism for bootstrapping more complex behavior.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the full humanoid, we have also developed active head platforms, of similar design to Cog's head, as shown in Figure 2 (Scassellati 1998a).

Development Bootstrapping Development is an incremental process. As it proceeds, prior structures and their behavioral manifestations place important constraints on the later structures and proficiencies. The earlier forms bootstrap the later structures by providing subskills and knowledge that can be re-used. <p> We are currently engaged in work studying bootstrapping new behaviors from social interactions. One research project focuses on building a robotic system capable of learning communication behaviors in a social context where the human provides various forms of scaffolding to facilitate the robot's learning task <ref> (Ferrell 1998b) </ref>. The system uses expressive facial gestures (see Figure 2) as feedback to the caregiver (Fer-rell 1998a). The caregiver can then regulate the complexity of the social interaction to optimize the robot's learning rate. Development of social interaction The social skills required to make use of scaffolding are complex.

Reference-contexts: When the right hemisphere then picked a shovel to correctly match the snow, the left hemisphere explained that you need a shovel to "clean out the chicken shed" <ref> (Gazzaniga & LeDoux 1978, p.148) </ref>. The separate halves of the subject independently got the right answer, but one side falsely explained the choice of the other. This suggests that there are multiple independent control systems, rather than a single monolithic one.

Reference-contexts: By exploiting the properties of the complete system, certain seemingly complex tasks can be made computationally simple. For example, when putting a jug of milk in the refrigerator, you can exploit the pendulum action of your arm to move the milk <ref> (Greene 1982) </ref>. The swing of the jug does not need to be explicitly planned or controlled, since it is the natural behavior of the system. Instead of having to plan the whole motion, the system only has to modulate, guide and correct the natural dynamics.

Reference-contexts: The caregiver can then regulate the complexity of the social interaction to optimize the robot's learning rate. Development of social interaction The social skills required to make use of scaffolding are complex. Infants acquire these social skills through a developmental progression <ref> (Hobson 1993) </ref>. One of the earliest precursors is the ability to share attention with the caregiver. This ability can take many forms, from the recognition of a pointing gesture to maintaining eye contact. In our work, we have also examined social interaction from this developmental perspective.

Reference-contexts: For example, infants are born with low acuity vision which simplifies the visual input they must process. The infant's visual performance develops in step with their ability to process the influx of stimulation <ref> (Johnson 1993) </ref>. The same is true for the motor system. Newborn infants do not have independent control over each degree of freedom of their limbs, but through a gradual increase in the granularity of their motor control they learn to coordinate the full complexity of their bodies.

Reference-contexts: This interaction continues to develop, indeed investigations with young owls have determined that visual stimuli greatly affect the development of sound localization. With a constant visual bias from prisms, owls adjusted their sound localization to match the induced visual errors <ref> (Knudsen & Knudsen 1985) </ref>. Irie (1997) built an auditory system for our robot that utilizes visual information to train auditory localization; the visually-determined location of a sound source with a corresponding motion is used to train an auditory spatial map.

Reference-contexts: In all cases, there is no central controller, and no modeling of the arms or the environment; the behavior of the whole system comes from the coupling of the arm and controller dynamics. Other researchers have built similar systems which exhibit complex behavior with either simple or no control <ref> (McGeer 1990, Schaal & Atkeson 1993) </ref> by exploiting the system dynamics. Sensory Integration Sensory Integration Simplifies Computation Some tasks are best suited for particular sensory modalities. Attempting to perform the task using only one modality is sometimes awkward and computation-ally intensive.

We believe that many of these discarded elements are essential to human intelligence and that they actually simplify the problem of creating humanlike intelligence.

The first step in this developmental progression is recognition of eye contact.

The system is currently capable of detecting faces in its peripheral vision, saccading to the faces, and finding eyes within its foveal vision <ref> (Scassellati 1998b) </ref>. This developmental chain has also produced a simple imitation behavior; the head will mimic yes/no head nods of the caregiver (Scassellati 1998c).

Reference-contexts: However, humans seem to be proficient only in particular sets of skills, at the expense of other skills, and often in non-obvious ways. A good example of this is the Stroop effect <ref> (Stroop 1935) </ref>. When presented with a list of words written in a variety of colors, performance in a color recognition and articulation task is actually dependent on the semantic content of the words; the task is very difficult if names of colors are printed in specialized colors.

Reference-contexts: A process where the acuity of both sensory and motor systems are gradually increased significantly reduces the difficulty of the learning problem <ref> (Thelen & Smith 1994) </ref>. To further facilitate learning, the gradual increase in internal complexity associated with development should be accompanied by a gradual increase in the complexity of the external world. For an infant, the caregiver biases how learning proceeds by carefully structuring and controlling the complexity of the environment.

We are currently engaged in work studying bootstrapping new behaviors from social interactions.
