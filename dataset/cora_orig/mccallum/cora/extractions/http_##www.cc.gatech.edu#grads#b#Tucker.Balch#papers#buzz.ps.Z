Abstract: The Georgia Tech entry to the AAAI Mobile Robot Competition, a schema-based reactive robotic system, is described. New developments are presented including the introduction of two novel behaviors probe and avoid-past, specialized planning and sensing

Reference-contexts: Each of these active behaviors generates a velocity vector based upon immediate sensory data which is combined with the outputs of the other behaviors. The result is transmitted to the robot for execution. For more details on schema-based navigation see <ref> [1] </ref>. Buzz's overall "plan" is depicted in Figure 2. For Phase 1, safe wandering, control remained in the wander state. <p> Perception Four different sensor sources were used: ultrasound, shaft encoders, vision, and infrared beacons. The ultrasonic sensors were used for obstacle avoidance as in our previous work <ref> [1] </ref>. Obstacle location was detected resulting in a repulsive field. Ultrasound was also used for final positioning of the robot relative to the pole in Phases 2 and 3.

Reference-contexts: Figure 4a shows how a simple box canyon can foil the strategy. Buzz's navigational behavior was improved with the addition of an Avoid-past motor schema. This improved system is able to navigate more efficiently and escape from box canyons (Fig. 4b) <ref> [2] </ref>. Avoid-past is a motor schema which, combined with Move-to-goal, Avoid-static-obstacle and Noise, forms a robust schema-based navigation system (Figure 3). Avoid-past uses a (a) Without Avoid-past (b) With Avoid-past corner. The robot's path is indicated by the black line. In this case, the robot becomes trapped. (b).

Reference-contexts: Transputer Implementation for Phase 1 Approximately four months before the competition, a proposal was made to port the workstation-based implementation onto a parallel-processing system. The system, called ANIMA (Architecture for Natural Intelligence in Machine Applications) <ref> [3] </ref>, is a flexible, real-time platform that had been recently developed at Georgia Tech for the study of robotic architectures. The goals were to provide both improved performance and on-board computation.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In July of 1992, a robot competition was sponsored by the American Association of Artificial Intelligence in San Jose, California <ref> [4] </ref>. A robot was required to perform three tasks. Phase 1 of the competition required a demonstration that the robot was able to effectively maneuver among both obstacles and humans in a highly cluttered and unmodeled environment.
