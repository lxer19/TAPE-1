Abstract: In most work applying genetic algorithms to populations of neural networks there is no real distinction between genotype and phenotype. In nature both the information contained in the genotype and the mapping of the genetic information into the phenotype are usually much more complex. The genotypes of many organisms exhibit diploidy, i.e., they include two copies of each gene: if the two copies are not identical in their sequences and therefore have a functional difference in their products (usually proteins), the expressed phenotypic feature is termed the dominant one, the other one recessive (not expressed). In this paper we review the literature on the use of diploidy and dominance operators in genetic algorithms; we present the new results we obtained with our own simulations in changing environments; finally, we discuss some results of our simulations that parallel biological findings.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the genotypes of many living beings exhibit diploidy, i.e., they include two copies of each gene. In our previous short paper <ref> ( Calabretta et al. , 1996) </ref> we described the results of simulations comparing the behavior of haploid and diploid populations of ecological neural networks living in both fixed and changing environments. In this paper we review the literature on the use of diploidy and dominance operators in genetic algorithms. <p> Adding more variability to the population's genetic pool results in a higher fitness for the population's best individuals but to lower average fitness. diploid individuals in changing environments (i.e. environments in which the position of the food area changes each 25 generations) with mutation rates of 1% and 3% <ref> (see also Calabretta et al, 1996) </ref>.

Khepera has a circular shape with a diameter of 55 mm., a height of 30 mm., and a weight of 70 g. The robot is supported by two wheels that allow it to move in various directions by separately regulating the speed of each wheel.

Reference-contexts: Dominance can be complete (e.g. brown vs. blue eye colour) or incomplete when the recessive feature is partially expressed (e.g. colour of some hybrid flowers). Co-dominance (i.e. the expression of both features) can also occur, <ref> (e.g. AB blood group, Strickberger, 1976) </ref>. Therefore, in some circumstances, dominance can vary in degree, because of intervening modifiers genes that enhance (or inhibit) the expression of 3 another gene (or group of genes) involved in a trait's expression (Wallace, 1981).

Reference-contexts: With this scheme the more effective allele becomes dominant , thereby shielding the recessive." Smith and Goldberg (1992) stressed the role of diploidy and dominance as abeyance structures and mechanisms. In their theoretical and experimental analysis of diploidy and dominance applied to a 0-1 knapsack problem <ref> (Syslo et al. , 1983) </ref>, which belongs to a class of common but difficult problems in operations research, they demonstrated that diploid GAs perform in temporally varying environment better than haploid GAs because " ... diploidy embodies a form of temporal memory that is distributed across population" and that "... an
