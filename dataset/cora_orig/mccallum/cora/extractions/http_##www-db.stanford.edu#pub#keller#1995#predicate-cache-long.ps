Abstract: 1 Stanford University, Computer Science Department, Gates Bulding 2A, Stanford, CA 94305-9020, USA 2 Stanford University, Computer Science Department, Stanford, CA 94305-9020, USA 3 Oracle Corporation, 500 Oracle Parkway, Box 659413, Redwood Shores, CA 94065, USA Abstract. We propose a new client-side data-caching scheme for relational databases with a central server and multiple clients. Data are loaded into each client cache based on queries executed on the central database at the server. These queries are used to form predicates that describe the cache contents. A subsequent query at the client may be satisfied in its local cache if we can determine that the query result is entirely contained in the cache. This issue is called cache completeness. A separate issue, cache currency, deals with the effect on client caches of updates committed at the central database. We examine the various performance tradeoffs and optimization issues involved in addressing the questions of cache currency and completeness using predicate descriptions and suggest solutions that promote good dynamic behavior. Lower query-response times, reduced message traffic, higher server throughput, and better scalability are some of the expected benefits of our approach over commonly used relational server-side and object ID-based or page-based client-side caching.

Reference-contexts: Similar observations can be made for the page-based caches presented in Carey et al. <ref> (1991, 1994) </ref> and Franklin (1993) these approaches do not address the question of associative query execution. We believe this issue is very important for caching in relational systems, where associative queries are common and are indeed one of the major reasons for their success. <p> However, the issue of associative query execution, which is an important consideration for relational databases, has not been examined in any of the above works. Among other related work, Roussopoulos <ref> (1991) </ref> proposes a view-caching scheme that uses the notions of extended logical access path and incremental access methods. A workstation-mainframe database architecture based on view cache techniques is described in Roussopoulos and Kang (1986). <p> Acknowledgements. We would like to thank Kurt Shoens, Gio Wiederhold, and the anonymous referees for their helpful comments. We also thank Catherine Hamon for many useful discussions. This work was inspired by the caching issues introduced in the context of view=objects in the Penguin project <ref> (Barsalou et al. 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A similar scheme called precision locks was proposed in <ref> (Jordan et al. 1981) </ref> for centralized systems. Query containment (Sagiv and Yannakakis 1980) is a topic closely related to the cache completeness question. Query evaluation on a set of derived relations is examined in Larson and Yang (1987).
