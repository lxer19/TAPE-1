Abstract: Network sensorsthose that coordinate amongst themselves to achieve a larger sensing taskwill revolutionize information gathering and processing both in urban environments and in inhospitable terrain. The sheer numbers of these sensors and the expected dynamics in these environments present unique challenges in the design of unattended autonomous sensor networks. These challenges lead us to hypothesize that sensor network coordination applications may need to be structured dioeerently from traditional network applications. In particular, we believe that localized algorithms (in which simple local node behavior achieves a desired global objective) may be necessary for sensor network coordination. In this paper, we describe localized algorithms, and then discuss directed dioeusion, a simple communication model for describing localized algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the conogura-tion devices will frequently change in terms of position, reachability, power availability, and even task details. Finally, because these devices interact with the physical environment, they, and the network as a whole, will experience a signiocant range of task dynamics. The WINS project <ref> [1] </ref> has considered device-level communication primitives needed to satisfy these requirements. However, these requirements potentially aoeect many other aspects of network design: routing and addressing mechanisms, naming and binding services, application architectures, security mechanisms, and so forth. <p> the dioeusion model can be used to describe not only other data dissemination patterns (shortest path multicast trees, energy-eOEcient spanning tree mul-ticast), but also other coordination algorithms (such as the triangulation example of Section 3). 5 Related Work Several projects have already demonstrated the feasibility of low power integrated sensors <ref> [1, 4, 5, 6] </ref> and MEMS-based microsensors [7]. Dioeerent contexts have been proposed for the application of small-scale networks of devices for sensing and actuation tasks. <p> These control networks today consist of a centralized processor coordinating the communication between many tens of sensors and actuators. Simple networks of integrated sensors have been proposed for military awareness situations <ref> [1] </ref>. These networks schedule sensor transmission using TDMA methods, and provide for automatic discovery of neighbors and cooperative detection by sensors. The Piconet [9] project is developing a prototype embedded network. Piconet is a low-rate (about 40 Kb/s), low-range (5 meters) ad-hoc radio network.

Reference-contexts: These ideas were developed in the context of a DARPA ISAT study, chaired by one of the authors (Estrin). The idea of applying directed dioeusion to this problem domain is due to Van Jacobson, based on experiences with reliable multicast <ref> [2] </ref> and adaptive Web caching design. 2 Sensor Network Challenges By early next century, sensor integration, coupled with unceasing electronic miniaturization, will make it possible to produce extremely inexpensive sensing devices.

Reference-contexts: The resulting rules often bear little resemblance to the original distributed computation. Second, some kinds of localized algorithms are parametrically sensitive; dioeerent choices of algorithm parameters can lead to radically dioeerent kinds of global behavior. An example of this is the reaction-dioeusion systems studied by Turing <ref> [3] </ref>. It is diOEcult to design localized algorithms that both empirically adapt to a wide range of environments and converge to the desired global behavior over that entire range. We believe that the following two-pronged approach can be used to overcome these diOEculties. <p> Several research eoeorts provide insights into the design of coordination algorithms for sensor networks.
