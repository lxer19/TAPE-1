Title: OPAL Physics Search for Chargino and Neutralino Production Using the OPAL Detector at p The

Abstract: and 172 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP. The expected background for each search is 0.9 events and no candidate events are observed in either search. This leads to 95% C.L. exclusion of chargino masses close to the kinematic limit within the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Assuming that the lightest chargino is heavier than the lightest neutralino by more than 10 GeV and tan fi = 1:5, a lightest chargino mass limit of 85.0 GeV is obtained if the universal scalar mass, m 0 , is larger than 1 TeV. The mass limit is 70.1 GeV for the smallest m 0 compatible with the limits on the slepton and sneutrino masses. Disclaimer: The results presented in this note are PRELIMINARY. This note is only for the use of the OPAL Collaboration and others who have been given explicit consent by OPAL.

Reference-contexts: In this note we report on a direct search for charginos and neutralinos predicted in supersymmetric (SUSY) theories <ref> [1] </ref> using the data collected with the OPAL detector. The results presented are for p s =170 and 172 GeV alone and have not been combined with the previous results 1 .

Reference-contexts: The luminosity is measured using small angle Bhabha events detected in the SW. To select good charged tracks and clusters in the calorimeters, quality requirements similar to those in Ref. <ref> [2] </ref> are applied. Calculations of experimental variables are performed using the four-momenta of tracks and of EM or HCAL clusters not associated with charged tracks 4 .

Reference-contexts: We obtain improved exclusion limits compared to the previous results from the analysis of data near the Z peak (LEP1), at p (LEP1.5) and at s = 161 GeV by the OPAL [2]<ref> [3] </ref> and other LEP collaborations [4]. The search for charginos is performed similarly to that described in [3] while a new more efficient method has been incorporated for the neutralino search. Similar, but more model-dependent, limits are also obtained by the CDF and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron pp collider [5]. <p> These analyses are similar to those at 161 GeV <ref> [3] </ref> but their robustness to WW background has been significantly improved. Isolated leptons are identified in the following way. Electrons are selected if they satisfied either of the two identification methods described in [25, 26] and muons are identified using three methods [27, 28, 29]. <p> Therefore, an algorithm optimised to have high efficiency for highly energetic leptons near the jet is used to identify the charged lepton in these events. The details of the algorithm are described in <ref> [3] </ref>. If an isolated lepton is found with this method, the invariant mass of the event excluding the lepton is required to be either smaller than 55 GeV or larger than 85 GeV. <p> Figures 18 and 19 for tan fi = 1:5 and for tan fi = 35 show the resulting exclusion regions in the M 2 plane. The region of M 2 excluded is improved significantly with respect to the limits at p s = 161 GeV <ref> [3] </ref>. For m 0 = 1 TeV the excluded region is close to the kinematical boundary for chargino production.

Reference-contexts: The lightest neutralino, ~ 0 1 , is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle, unless otherwise stated, and is therefore stable and invisible. Throughout this note R parity conservation is assumed. We use the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) <ref> [6] </ref> to guide the analysis but more general cases are also studied. In the MSSM two chargino mass eigenstates ( ~ 1 and ~ 2 ) and four neutralino mass eigenstates ( ~ 0 1 , ~ 0 3 and ~ 0 4 ) are expected to exist.

Reference-contexts: The total background expected for 10:4 pb 1 is 0.87 events, consistent with no events observed in data after all cuts. 3.2 Detection of neutralinos The search for neutralinos is performed by dividing the event sample into two categories: (C) N ch 4. The cuts of category (D) <ref> [33] </ref> are designed to improve on the efficiency for ~ 0 2 ~ 0 1 events that would have been obtained from using the cuts of categories (A) and (B).

Reference-contexts: the small region of large m ~ 0 2 and low m ~ 0 1 outside the prediction of the MSSM. 15 Event are divided into two jets using the Durham jet algorithm, and a 3D-vertex recon-struction is performed on the tracks in each jet by using the tear-down algorithm <ref> [34] </ref>. The decay length significance in the j-th jet (j = 1; 2), R j , is defined as L j / j , where L j is the reconstructed decay length and j is its error.

Reference-contexts: From the observation of no events and the signal detection efficiencies and their uncertainties, exclusion regions are determined using the procedure outlined in <ref> [35] </ref>, incorporating systematic errors following the method given in [36]. These limits do not depend on the details of the SUSY models, but some production angular distributions have to be assumed to estimate detection efficiencies. <p> We present results for two cases: m 0 = 1 TeV and the smallest m 0 consistent with light ~ `, ~- and h 0 not yet excluded, namely m ~ ` &gt; 45:0 GeV, m ~- &gt; 41:8 GeV and m h 0 &gt; 45:0 GeV <ref> [35] </ref>. Masses, production cross-sections and branching fractions are calculated according to the CMSSM from the parameters M 2 , , tan fi, m 0 and A (the trilinear coupling) [7, 8, 9, 10].
