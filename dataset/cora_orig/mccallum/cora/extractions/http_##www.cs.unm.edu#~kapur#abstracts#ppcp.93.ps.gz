Title: An Approach for Solving Systems of Parametric Polynomial Equations  
Author: Deepak Kapur 
Note: 1.2 Introduction  
Abstract: 1.1 Abstract An approach for solving nonlinear polynomial equations involving parameters is proposed. A distinction is made between parameters and variables. The objective is to generate from a system of parametric equations, solved forms from which solutions for specific values of parameters can be obtained without much additional computations. It should be possible to analyze the parametrized solved forms so that it can be determined for different parameter values whether there are infinitely many solutions, finitely many solutions, or no solutions at all. The approach is illustrated for two different symbolic methods for solving parametric equations - Grobner basis computations and characteristic set computations. These methods are illustrated on a number of examples. Many complex phenomena can be modeled using nonlinear polynomial equations. Examples include imaging transformations in computer vision, computing geometric invariants, geometric and solid modeling, constraint-based modeling, reasoning about geometry problems, properties of chemical equilibrium, kinematics, robotics; an interested reader may consult [13, 14, 7, 5] for many examples. Variables in these equations can be classified into two subsets: independent variables and dependent variables. Independent variables often correspond to input to a phenomenon or the features of a physical subsystem in a phenomenon. Henceforth, independent variables will also be called parameters; dependent variables will be called just variables . For different parameter values, dependent variables have different behavior. A designer is usually interested in studying the phenomenon on a wide range of parameter

Reference-contexts: A parametric characteristic set can be computed using a method similar to a method used to compute a characteristic set of polynomials as discussed in <ref> [19, 20, 3, 11] </ref>. A simple algorithm for computing a parametric characteristic set works as follows. Firstly, for every ambiguous polynomial, generate an equivalent set of unambiguous polynomials.

Reference-contexts: An example illustrating the construction is briefly discussed. During the development of this approach, we came to know about related approaches for linear equations by Sit [16, 17], and for nonlinear polynomial equations based on Wu's characteristic set method by Chou and Gao <ref> [4] </ref>, and also for nonlinear polynomial equations based on the Grobner basis method by Weispfenning [18]. Apart from the fact that the proposed approach is simpler and easier to understand, there appear to be considerable differences between the methods outlined here and in the above cited papers. <p> And, the existence of an infinite path is impossible since that contradicts Hilbert's basis condition. The method presented here has been tried on many examples including those in [18] and <ref> [4] </ref>. Our outputs are different from the ones reported in [18]. Example 1 in [18], for instance, is a discussion of a set of two generic univariate quadratic polynomials; a Grobner basis given in [18] includes two parametric cubic polynomials. In our computation, higher degree polynomials will not be computed. <p> Computations of solutions from parametric Grobner bases are briefly illustrated later. Example 1: We illustrate the Grobner basis construction on a simple example that models a chemical system and explains chemical equilibrium. The example is discussed in [18] and <ref> [4] </ref> so it also contrasts the proposed approach with methods discussed in [18] and [4] as well as illustrates differences in computational steps and outputs. <p> Example 1: We illustrate the Grobner basis construction on a simple example that models a chemical system and explains chemical equilibrium. The example is discussed in [18] and <ref> [4] </ref> so it also contrasts the proposed approach with methods discussed in [18] and [4] as well as illustrates differences in computational steps and outputs. <p> This result is different from the comprehensive Grobner basis given in [18] or ascending sets given in <ref> [4] </ref>. 6 In [18], many extra and complicated polynomials appear in the comprehensive basis given as the result. In [4], there are too many cases given which can be easily combined; in contrast the above result is compact, very much in Sit's sense [16]. <p> This result is different from the comprehensive Grobner basis given in [18] or ascending sets given in <ref> [4] </ref>. 6 In [18], many extra and complicated polynomials appear in the comprehensive basis given as the result.

Example 2: Let us consider another example from [4] to contrast the proposed approach with Chou and Gao's approach. Consider the following set of polynomials: fy 2 zxy + x 2 + z 1; xy + z 2 1; y 2 + x 2 + z 2 r 2 g; in which r is a parameter. <p> Since 4' is ambiguous, equivalent unambiguous polynomials are: 7 : &lt; fr 4 4r 2 + 3 6= 0g; q 4 &gt;; and 6 Because of space limitations, definitions of comprehensive and reduced Grobner bases as given in [18] and ascending sets in <ref> [4] </ref> cannot be reproduced. The reader may consult the original papers for definitions and other details.

The ascending sets given for this example in <ref> [4] </ref> are different from the above parametric Grobner basis, in particular they are far too many; many of these ascending sets can be combined and described using a single ascending set. The above description is much more compact and comprehensive much in the spirit of [16, 17]. <p> The set of all chains collected in this way is a parametric characteristic set. Many variations of the above simple algorithm are possible and many heuristics can be incorporated. Many examples, including those in <ref> [18, 4] </ref>, have been successfully worked out using the above algorithm. 1.5.5 Example Let us consider Example 3 of the previous section used for illustrating Grobner basis computations, and apply the characteristic set construction.

Reference-contexts: Then the approach is used to develop an algorithm for computing a parametric characteristic set. For this construction, the discussion is brief because of space limitations. The construction is illustrated using an example. More details can be found in an expanded version of this paper <ref> [9] </ref>. From a parametric Grobner basis and characteristic set, solutions of parametric polynomial equations can be extracted.

In [8], we developed a characterization of characteristic sets as defined by Ritt, which is different from Wu's definition of a characteristic set. <p> A parametric characteristic set can be computed using a method similar to a method used to compute a characteristic set of polynomials as discussed in <ref> [19, 20, 3, 11] </ref>. A simple algorithm for computing a parametric characteristic set works as follows. Firstly, for every ambiguous polynomial, generate an equivalent set of unambiguous polynomials. <p> &gt;; 1 00 : &lt; fu = 0; v 6= 0g; f &gt;; 1 000 : &lt; fu 6= 0; v 6= 0; u 3 + v 2 6= 0g; f &gt;; 6 :&lt; fv 6= 0; u 6= 0; u 3 + v 2 6= 0g; r &gt;; In <ref> [20] </ref>, Wu gave a structure theorem and showed how it could be used for computing zeros of polynomial equations from their characteristic sets. This construction can be extended to constrained polynomials. Below we illustrate how solutions can be obtained from some of the chains in the above parametric characteristic set.
