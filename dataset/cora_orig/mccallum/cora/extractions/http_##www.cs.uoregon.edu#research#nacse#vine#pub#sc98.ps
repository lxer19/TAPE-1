Abstract: The Virtual Notebook Environment (ViNE) is a platform-independent, web-based interface designed to support a range of scientific activities across distributed, heterogeneous computing platforms. ViNE provides scientists with a web-based version of the common paper-based lab notebook, but in addition, it provides support for collaboration and management of computational experiments. Collaboration is supported with the web-based approach, which makes notebook material generally accessible and with a hierarchy of security mechanisms that screen that access. ViNE provides uniform, system-transparent access to data, tools,

Reference-contexts: This ability to embed experiments allows users to build libraries of common tasks. 3 Implementation The World Wide Web provides a collaborative, distributed, heterogeneous environment. Our implementation takes advantage of web-related technologies such as Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) [9], Common Gateway Interface (CGI) [5], Java <ref> [1] </ref>, and Perl [23] to achieve portability and consistent interfaces across platforms. Here we discuss the implementation of stems, the data and tool organization components, and the experiment control component. 3.1 Stems Stems use their servers to communicate across the network with each other. <p> The stem servers are persistent and multi-threaded, allowing them to handle multiple requests at one time. Requests are sent across TCP/IP sockets in a specified format similar to Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). This format is used for all requests made to the servers. The servers are written in Java <ref> [1] </ref>, exploiting its widespread availability on many commonly used platforms, and its abundant built-in routines for socket communication and threads. In order for other programs to interact with the servers, they must use the library of communication methods provided by the stem.

Reference-contexts: easily keep a record of many experiments, greatly reducing the possibility of accidental information loss that often occurs with paper notebooks and manually organized files. 4 Application The Brain Electrophysiology Laboratory (BEL) at the University of Oregon combines the studies of the brain with analytic methods found in cognitive psychology <ref> [2] </ref>. Much of our work with them has focused on the dense electrode array research project as described earlier.

Reference-contexts: At Purdue, work has been done on creating a system where users can access and run existing software tools across the World Wide Web using a browser [15]. NetSolve <ref> [4] </ref> is another system that allows users to access computational resources distributed across the network. It provides an interface to scientific packages and supports interaction from within MATLAB, a command-line shell, C and Fortran programs, or the World Wide Web.

Reference-contexts: This ability to embed experiments allows users to build libraries of common tasks. 3 Implementation The World Wide Web provides a collaborative, distributed, heterogeneous environment. Our implementation takes advantage of web-related technologies such as Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) [9], Common Gateway Interface (CGI) <ref> [5] </ref>, Java [1], and Perl [23] to achieve portability and consistent interfaces across platforms. Here we discuss the implementation of stems, the data and tool organization components, and the experiment control component. 3.1 Stems Stems use their servers to communicate across the network with each other. <p> The tool organization component maintains descriptions of available tools and their wrappers. Tools are categorized as either general or custom, depending on whether they can be fully controlled from the command line (general) or require more complex interaction and control (custom). Wrappers are Common Gateway Interface (CGI) <ref> [5] </ref> scripts that run a tool with the given parameters and can be accessed by a leaf's web server. ViNE provides wrappers for general tools. To register a general tool with ViNE, the user provides its name, location, and a description of its input and output parameters.

Reference-contexts: The neurophysiology researchers seldom formally record the "process" of analysis (that is, the sequence of computations run), but rather reconstruct the process for design walk-throughs with colleagues or for publications. Other scientists that we have worked with on large simulations <ref> [6] </ref> do keep a detailed record of their computational analysis, recording parameter modifications and intermediate simulation output. ViNE aims to support all of these activities across modern computing networks.

Reference-contexts: Most of the BEL scientists' tools are command files containing functions that are interpreted in the MATLAB environment. The scientists rely heavily on MATLAB, and thus it was the first application we wrapped, making most of their existing tools available within ViNE. In addition, we added GNUplot <ref> [12] </ref>, an image conversion tool, and a movie generator to enhance their capabilities. Information regarding location and usage of data and tools is captured as they are added to the notebook and is available to the experiment builder.
