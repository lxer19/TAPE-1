Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as ``work in progress.'' Abstract In a variety of scenarios, a local communication channel is desirable for conference-related information exchange between co-located but otherwise independent application entities, for example those taking part in application sessions that belong to the same conference. Such a mechanism allows for coordination of applications entities to e.g. implement synchronization between media streams or realize tightly coupled conferences. The local conference Message Bus (Mbus) provides a means to achieve the necessary amount of coordination between co-located conferencing applications for virtually any type of conference. The Message Bus comprises two logically distinct parts: a message transport and addressing infrastructure and a set of common as well as media tool specific messages. This documents deals with message addressing, transport, and security issues and defines the message syntax for the Mbus. It does not define application oriented semantics and procedures for using the message bus. The common procedures for Mbus operation as well as the common set of application/media specific messages are introduced in a companion Internet draft[9].

Reference-contexts: Terminology for requirement specifications In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <ref> [1] </ref> and indicate requirement levels for compliant Mbus implementations. 1.4. Definition of terms Conference The relationship between a set of human beings that are communicating together. In this document, the term is used for both tightly and loosely coupled [4] computer based conferences.

Reference-contexts: Message Format A conference coordination message comprises a header and a body. The header is used to indicate how and where a message should be delivered, the body provides information and commands to the destination entity. The following information is included in the header: The MsgDigest is a Base64-encoded <ref> [3] </ref> calculated hash value of the entire message (starting from the ProtocolID field) as described in appendices A (Algorithms) and C (Mbus configuration). A fixed ProtocolID field identifies the version of the message bus protocol used. The protocol defined in this document is mbus/1.0. <p> String parameters in the payload MUST be enclosed in the double quote () character. Within strings, the escape character is the backslash ("), and the following escape Ott/Perkins/Kutscher [Page 10] INTERNET-DRAFT A Message Bus for Conferencing Systems August 1998 sequences are defined: Opaque data is represented as Base64-encoded <ref> [3] </ref> character strings surrounded by "&lt;" and "&gt;" Escape Sequence Meaning "" " "n &lt;newline&gt; 3.6. Messages The specific messages applications will send using the Mbus are not defined in this document.

Reference-contexts: Definition of terms Conference The relationship between a set of human beings that are communicating together. In this document, the term is used for both tightly and loosely coupled <ref> [4] </ref> computer based conferences. Participant A (typically human) being that takes part in a conference. Member The system, including all software and hardware components, that is used in a tele conference to represent a single participant.

Reference-contexts: A typical scenario is that audio, video and shared workspace functionality is provided by three separate tools (although some combined tools exist). This maps well onto the underlying RTP <ref> [5] </ref> (as well as other) media streams, which are also transmitted separately. Giv en such an architecture, it is useful to be able to perform some coordination of the separate media tools. <p> Conference context All state information kept about a conference at each member of this conference. Application session (AS), Session The set of media agents/applications that act as peers to each other within a conference. For real-time data, this generally will be an RTP session <ref> [5] </ref>; for other application protocols, other horizontal protocols may define their own type of session con cept. Possible synonyms are application group or media agent group. Application instance, application entity, media agent A program instance taking part in an application session for a conference participant.

Reference-contexts: This may be the e-mail address of an individual (or some other globally unique identifier) that is part of the information to identify her within a conference but can also be used to invite her via the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <ref> [6] </ref> protocol. Presence A presence corresponds to a person (identified by a UCI) being logged in at an end system and available for conferencing, i. e. a presence may be identified by the pair of a user's UCI and the respective end system's identification (such as a host name).

Reference: [8] <author> D. </author> <title> Meyer Administratively Scoped IP Multicast, </title> <type> RFC 2365, </type> <month> July </month> <year> 1998 </year>
Reference-contexts: Transport All messages are transmitted as UDP messages with two ways of sending messages being possible: 1) local multicast (host-local or link-local, see Appendix Mbus configuration) to a fixed, yet to be assigned link-local address of the administratively scoped multicast space as described in RFC 2365 <ref> [8] </ref>. There is a base port for each presence conducting conferences using the Mbus. This port SHALL be used for communication between application entities not associated with a particular conference. For each conference that a person participates in, a dedicated port is used for conference-specific communication.

Reference-contexts: Messages The specific messages applications will send using the Mbus are not defined in this document. Currently a companion document <ref> [9] </ref> is produced defining classes of messages which are of use in certain application areas. Additional documents are expected to follow. 4.
