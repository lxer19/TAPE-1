Abstract: Much work has been done in dialogue modeling for Human Computer Interaction. Problems arise in situations where disambiguation of highly ambiguous data base output is necessary. We propose to model the task rather than the dialogue itself. Furthermore, we propose underspecified representations to represent relevant data and to serve as a base for generating clarification questions that guide the user efficiently to arrive at his communicative goal. In this paper, we establish a connection between underspecified representations as representations of disjunctions and clarification questions. Our approach to clarifying dialogues differs from other approaches in that the form of the clarification dialogues is entirely determined by the domain modeling and by the un derspecified representations.

Reference-contexts: Underspecified feature structures represent sets of typed feature structures. Moreover, generalizations of a set of typed feature structures represent the similarities of all feature structures in the set. 2.1 Domain Modeling We chose to represent descriptions of objects using typed feature structures <ref> [ Carpenter, 1992 ] </ref> . The types are ordered in a so-called type hierarchy which represents domain-specific terminological knowledge using IS-A and IS-PART-OF relations.

Reference-contexts: there are several possible questions that may be asked? If information is missing, how can one provide the user with all options available at this point of the dialogue? To overcome these problems, we propose a departure from the model-based approach to dialogue processing in favor of an information-based approach <ref> [ Denecke, 1997 ] </ref> . By information-based approach, we understand that the specificity of the information available at any given point in the dialogue, comprising results from database requests, determine the actions to undertaken by the dialogue system.

Reference-contexts: Rather, the system tries to use as much information from the input as is useful in disambiguating the representations. The algorithms have been implemented in a dialogue system using the speech recognition engine JANUS <ref> [ Waibel, 1996 ] </ref> .
