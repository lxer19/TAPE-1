Abstract: Greece in 1989. In 1991 he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship. Since then he has been with the Department of Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles where he is pursuing his Ph.D. in the area of Computer Networks and Communications. He received the M.S. and Engineers degrees both in Computer Science from UCLA in 1993 and 1995 respectively. His current research interests are in the areas of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and high-speed networks and in particular of ATM switching. Mr. Kolias is a student member of the IEEE.
