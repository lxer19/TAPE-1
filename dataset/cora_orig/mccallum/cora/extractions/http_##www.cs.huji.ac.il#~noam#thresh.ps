Title: The communication complexity of threshold gates  
Author: Noam Nisan 
Date: November 2, 1994  
Abstract: We prove upper bounds on the randomized communication complexity of evaluating a threshold gate (with arbitrary weights). For linear threshold gates this is done in the usual 2 party communication model, and for degree-d threshold gates this is done in the multiparty model. We then use these upper bounds together with known lower bounds for communication complexity in order to give very easy proofs for lower bounds in various models of computation involving threshold gates. This generalizes several known bounds and answers several open problems.

Reference-contexts: We will use both the 2 well studied two-party model of Yao [Yao79], and the somewhat less studied multiparty model of Chandra, Furst and Lipton <ref> [CFL83] </ref>. Definitions of these models appear in section 2. The basic argument is the same in all cases: If a function with high communication complexity is computed by elements each having small communication complexity, then many of these elements are required in order to compute the function. <p> These lower bounds show in fact that fi (n) bits are needed even to be correct with probability slightly better than 1=2.

Reference-contexts: We are now in the situation of searching for a number, i sig , in the range 1::n using queries of the form "i sig &gt; i?", where each answer may be incorrect with a small constant probability. This situation has been studied in the literature, and <ref> [FPRU90] </ref> show how it can be done, with probability of error *, using O (log n + log * 1 ) queries. 2 Remark: The improved protocol is not really needed for any of the applications, without it we would simply loose another log n factor in all our lower bounds.

From this we easily also deduce: Lemma 1 Given an arbitrary d-threshold gate on m variables, there exists an equivalent d-threshold gate in which all weights are O (m d d log m)-bit integers.

Reference-contexts: Notice that now linear threshold gates are just threshold gates of degree 1. There have been several lower bounds in the literature on the number of threshold elements needed (in various models of computation) in order to compute certain functions <ref> [HMP + 87, GT91, ROS93, Vat92, HG91, Smo90] </ref>. In this paper we obtain these lower bounds in a unified and simple manner and in fact generalize each of these known lower bounds in at least one of three ways: 1. <p> Arguments along these lines were used in varying levels of explicitness and in different scenarios in <ref> [HMP + 87, GT91, ROS93, Vat92, HG91, CG85, Vaz87] </ref>. We will prove our lower bounds on the number of threshold gates required to compute functions for which there are known "large" communication complexity lower bounds. <p> trees The second model we consider is that of decision trees, where each query may be a threshold function. (The decision tree computes a boolean function of the boolean inputs.) This model was considered in [GT91] who prove a linear lower bound (for IP) for linear threshold gates and in <ref> [Vat92] </ref> who prove a near-linear lower bound (for GIP ) for d-threshold gates with small integer weights. We prove a slightly weaker bound but which applies also to DISJ (for which the techniques of [GT91] do not apply,) and which applies also to d-threshold gates with arbitrary weights. <p> We prove a slightly weaker bound but which applies also to DISJ (for which the techniques of [GT91] do not apply,) and which applies also to d-threshold gates with arbitrary weights. This answers an open problem posed in [GT91] and in <ref> [Vat92] </ref>. Theorem 3. Any decision tree of linear threshold gates computing IP n or DISJ n requires depth (n=logn). Any decision tree of d-threshold gates computing GIP d+1;n requires depth (c d n=log 2 n), where c d = d 3 4 d .
