Reference-contexts: The order in which the parts appear in the documentation does not have to be the same order in which they must appear in the code source file (s) according the programming language rules. This form of presentation and code construction is supported by Briggs' Nuweb tool <ref> [Briggs] </ref>, which generates both the code file and the documentation file directly from a single Nuweb source file. Any number of auxiliary files, such as makefiles and test data files, can also be packaged in the Nuweb source file, as is illustrated in the last section.
Reference: [Knuth84] <author> D.E. Knuth, </author> <title> Literate programming. </title> <journal> Computer Journal 27 (1984), </journal> <pages> 97-111. </pages>
Reference-contexts: It may be useful to read the code as a short, simple illustration of some of the advantages of using such standard library components. The presentation of the code is also a simple illustration of the style known as the "literate programming style" <ref> [Knuth84] </ref>. Code is presented in "parts" numbered according to the page number on which they appear, with parts on the same page distinguished by appending a letter to the number.
