Title: Dynamics of TCP Traffic over ATM Networks  
Author: Allyn Romanow and Sally Floyd 
Date: May, 1995.  
Note: This is a slightly-expanded version of a paper that appeared in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas In Communications,  
Abstract: We investigate the performance of TCP connections over ATM networks without ATM-level congestion control, and compare it to the performance of TCP over packet-based networks. For simulations of congested networks, the effective throughput of TCP over ATM can be quite low when cells are dropped at the congested ATM switch. The low throughput is due to wasted bandwidth as the congested link transmits cells from `corrupted' packets, i.e., packets in which at least one cell is dropped by the switch. We investigate two packet discard strategies which alleviate the effects of fragmentation. Partial Packet Discard, in which remaining cells are discarded after one cell has been dropped from a packet, improves throughput somewhat. We introduce Early Packet Discard, a strategy that prevents fragmentation and brings throughput up to maximal levels by having the switch drop whole packets prior to buffer overflow.

Reference-contexts: Packet sizes were chosen according to common link level maximum transfer units (MTUs). The TCP packet size often used in IP networks is 512 bytes; 1500 bytes is the packet size for ethernet networks; 4352 bytes is for FDDI networks; and 9180 is the default for IP over ATM <ref> [A93] </ref>. Buffer size per output port ranges from 256 cells to 8000 cells. A buffer size of 1000 or 2000 cells per port for a small switch (e.g., 16 - 32 ports) would not be considered unusual. <p> While larger packet sizes may be considered advantageous because they do not fragment Network File System (NFS) packets (which default to 8 kB), and because some end-nodes can process larger packets more cheaply than smaller packets <ref> [A93] </ref>, large packets are a performance disadvantage in a congested local-area ATM network. A secondary reason for the low effective throughput in some of the simulations is that the congested link is occasionally idle.

Reference-contexts: We examine these results and explain the dynamics causing the poor behavior. Based on this analysis, we explore two simple control mechanisms: Partial Packet Discard and Early Packet Discard. In Partial Packet Discard <ref> [AA93] </ref>, if a cell is dropped from a switch buffer, the subsequent cells in the higher layer protocol data unit are discarded. We find that Partial Packet Discard improves performance to a certain degree, but that throughput performance is still not optimal. <p> We refer to this strategy as Partial Packet Discard (PPD). It was called "selective cell discarding" in <ref> [AA93] </ref>. A similar cell-dropping mechanism was developed in the Fairisle ATM switch [LM91, p. 330].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We investigate basic questions of congestion control for best-effort traffic in ATM networks. ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is the 53-byte cell-based transport method chosen by ITU-TSS (formerly CCITT) for Broadband ISDN <ref> [D93] </ref>. ATM is also under development for use in high speed LANs. In the ATM context, best-effort traffic is data traffic that does not have stringent real-time requirements. <p> Analysis of throughput behavior shows that the poor perfor 2 The ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) is the layer above the ATM layer that adapts the fixed-size ATM cell to the next higher-level data unit, which may be either signaling or user data <ref> [CCITT362, D93] </ref>. 3 For the purposes of this paper, IP is relevant only in that it determines the size of the higher level packet. mance of TCP over plain ATM is caused by the well-known problem of fragmentation. In this case, TCP/IP packets are fragmented at the ATM layer.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the addition of EPD mechanisms to drop a packet of cells from stalled connections could free-up valuable memory, and at the same time provide early notification of congestion to the TCP source. Mechanisms similar to those in <ref> [FCH94] </ref> could be explored to implement EPD for ATM switches with per-VC buffers. 7 Conclusions and Future Work As we have shown in this paper, TCP can perform poorly over plain ATM, primarily due to fragmentation. This situation is ameliorated by larger switch buffers and smaller sized TCP packets.

Reference-contexts: Despite the fact that link idle time is not an important factor in these simulations, it could be a significant problem with TCP over plain ATM [KMP94]. The phenomenon of link idle time due to synchronization of the TCP window adjustment algorithms has been studied for Packet TCP <ref> [SZC90] </ref>. This synchronization could be exacerbated in ATM networks, where cells from different packets are usually interleaved at the switch, causing several TCP connections to synchronize and go through slow-start at roughly the same time.

Reference-contexts: Although this study is specific to TCP, the results are relevant to any packet-based protocol running over ATM. Thus the general results apply to UDP (User Data-gram Protocol), or to other transport protocols such as DECnet [JR88], IPX, VMTP [C88], and AppleTalk <ref> [SAO90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This study is focused on the dynamics of TCP (Transport Control Protocol) over ATM networks. 3 The performance of TCP is important as the protocol is widely used in today's Internet and private networks <ref> [S94] </ref>. Although this study is specific to TCP, the results are relevant to any packet-based protocol running over ATM. Thus the general results apply to UDP (User Data-gram Protocol), or to other transport protocols such as DECnet [JR88], IPX, VMTP [C88], and AppleTalk [SAO90]. <p> In 4.3-Tahoe BSD TCP, packet loss (a dropped packet) is treated as a "congestion experienced" signal. The source uses the fast retransmit procedure to discover a packet loss: if four ACK packets are received acknowledging the same data packet, the source decides that a packet has been dropped <ref> [S94] </ref>. The source reacts to a packet loss by setting the threshold to half the current window, decreasing the current window to one, and entering the slow-start phase. The source also uses retransmission timers to detect lost packets.

Reference-contexts: In many switch designs these functions are co-located and it is relatively inexpensive to implement EPD. TCP over ATM with EPD shares many of the dynamics of TCP in packet-switched networks. This includes a lack of protection from misbehaving users, global synchronization <ref> [ZC90] </ref>, a bias against connections with longer roundtrip times [FJ92], and a bias against connections with multiple contested gateways [F91]. Early Packet Discard could have an additional bias against connections with shorter packets.
