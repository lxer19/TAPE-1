Reference-contexts: Lemma 7.2.5 proves the existence of 1-sparse 1-maximal subgraphs for any graph, cost function, and benefit function. However, we know of no polynomial time algorithm for constructing 1-sparse 1-maximal subgraphs. In fact, even verifying the 1-maximality condition seems computationally difficult. Fortunately, <ref> [AABV95] </ref> provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm. In particular, for any graph G, cost function c, and benefit function %, their algorithm, which we call maxsparse, can find a O (log 2 B)-sparse 1-maximal subgraph where B = %(G)=min v2V s.t. %(v)6=0 f%(v)g.

Reference-contexts: Other optimization goals, such as minimizing the total delay in the network [BG92] or maximizing the total accepted "value", when each virtual circuit is characterized by a "value" <ref> [AAP93] </ref>, have also been discussed in the literature. The traffic patterns for the networks and the applications described in Section 1.1 will not be known in advance since the usage patterns for these applications and networks are currently not well understood. <p> When preemption is allowed, the network may decide to terminate any virtual circuit at any time. Preemption is undesirable in most of the applications (such as video-servers) that we mention in Section 1.1. Awerbuch, Azar and Plotkin <ref> [AAP93] </ref> develop competitive algorithms for general networks, but with the restriction that every virtual circuit request at most 1= log n of the capacity of the lowest capacity link. They provide an O (log n) competitive algorithm, where n is the number of nodes in the network. <p> The virtual circuits in [AAF + 93] all have infinite duration. The result is extended to virtual circuit with finite duration in [AKP + 93]. Both [AAF + 93] and <ref> [AAP93] </ref> use minimum cost routing where the cost metric is an exponential function of the link utilization [SM90]. In [ABFR94] Awerbuch, Bartal, Fiat and Rosen consider the admission control and virtual circuit routing problem on trees. <p> The algorithm is randomized and has an O (log n) competitive ratio. For the line, they show a matching lower bound of (log n). By combining their basic algorithm with the algorithm in <ref> [AAP93] </ref>, the authors provide an O (log n) competitive algorithm for virtual circuits of arbitrary bandwidth. <p> This matches our (log log n) lower bound. This thesis also presents a very practical algorithm for admission control and routing on general topology networks. We call this algorithm exp. The exp algorithm is based on the general topology algorithm in <ref> [AAP93] </ref>. The algorithm in [AAP93] addresses two of our goals (cf. Section 1.2). It does not require advance knowledge of the traffic pattern, and it uses non-greedy admission control to maximize the number of accepted requests. Unfortunately, the algorithm in [AAP93] has several disadvantages that prevent it from being practical. <p> This matches our (log log n) lower bound.

Unfortunately, the algorithm in [AAP93] has several disadvantages that prevent it from being practical. First, the algorithm deals only with admission control and does not address routing.

Third, each link must maintain and distribute large amounts of state information. Finally, the algorithm is optimized for the worst-case situation and does not work well in common situations. The exp algorithm substantially modifies the algorithm in <ref> [AAP93] </ref> to address its shortcomings. Finally, we provide non-greedy admission control and routing algorithms for multicast communication. We provide three algorithms. Each of the algorithms seeks to maximize the total amount of accepted bandwidth. <p> While our algorithms for multicast communication achieve a good competitive ratio, they will not perform well in practice if used in their present form. However, we believe that the algorithms will serve as the basis for a practical algorithm in much the same way that the algorithm in <ref> [AAP93] </ref> does. In fact, we believe that many of the techniques developed for the exp algorithm will also be useful for multicast communications. <p> The basic idea of using sequences of requests where the number of requests using some number of resources is twice the number of requests using twice the resources was used in the lower bound proofs in <ref> [AAP93] </ref>.

In fact, the non-greedy algorithm of [AAP93], presented in Section 4.2, achieves an O (log n) competitive ratio. This section strengthens the support for non-greedy admission control by proving an (n) lower bound for the greedy admission control and routing problem for general topology networks (cf. Definition 2.3.2). <p> Definition 3.7.1), Section 4.4 considers fat-trees, and Section 4.5 considers trees. The problems considered in Sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 are not special cases of the problem considered in Section 4.2. In particular, the O (log d) competitive algorithm for general topology networks of <ref> [AAP93] </ref>, presented in Section 4.2, has the restriction that the bandwidth of every request must be less than 1= log d of the capacity of the lowest capacity link, where d is the length of the longest simple path in the network.

Lower bounds in [AAP93] show that this restriction cannot be removed without increasing the competitive ratio of the algorithm. Sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 address the situation where each request may require up to the entire link capacity for some links. <p> Sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 address the situation where each request may require up to the entire link capacity for some links. For general topology networks we give a brief presentation of the admission control and routing algorithm of <ref> [AAP93] </ref>. We do not include any of the complexity or correctness proofs. The algorithm serves as the basis for the practical general topology admission control and 71 routing algorithm presented in Chapter 5. The algorithm is also used as a subroutine by our algorithm for the fat-tree. <p> We show how to construct an algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of O (d + K) for the hierarchical backbone network. This construction can be used to extend the admission control and routing algorithm of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> to networks where some regions of the network do not meet the bandwidth restrictions imposed by [AAP93]. Hierarchical backbone networks can be used to model several important networks including the telephone network, the Internet, and fat-trees. <p> This construction can be used to extend the admission control and routing algorithm of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> to networks where some regions of the network do not meet the bandwidth restrictions imposed by [AAP93]. Hierarchical backbone networks can be used to model several important networks including the telephone network, the Internet, and fat-trees. In fact, we use the techniques developed for hierarchical backbone networks to construct an algorithm that achieves an O (log log n) competitive ratio for the size n fat-tree. <p> In particular, we introduce a bandwidth restriction. The algorithm we present is a simplified 1 version of an algorithm that was originally presented in <ref> [AAP93] </ref>. We call the algorithm iaap. The performance function used in this section measures the number of accepted virtual circuit requests . <p> The bandwidth restricted admission control and routing problem is the same as the admission control and routing problem in Definition 2.3.1 except that the maximum bandwidth of any 1 The actual algorithm presented in <ref> [AAP93] </ref>, called aap, can handle virtual circuits that have a finite duration. We introduce the aap algorithm in Chapter 5. 72 circuit request is restricted. A lower bound in [AAP93] shows that this restriction on the maximum bandwidth cannot be relaxed. <p> admission control and routing problem in Definition 2.3.1 except that the maximum bandwidth of any 1 The actual algorithm presented in <ref> [AAP93] </ref>, called aap, can handle virtual circuits that have a finite duration. We introduce the aap algorithm in Chapter 5. 72 circuit request is restricted. A lower bound in [AAP93] shows that this restriction on the maximum bandwidth cannot be relaxed. Definition 4.2.1 (bandwidth restricted admission control and routing for G) Let G be a set of undirected graphs. <p> In the definition, is used to restrict the size of r i . This restriction on r i is needed by the proofs in <ref> [AAP93, Plo95] </ref>.) If there exists a path p in the network such that the cost of the path, P e2p c i (e) is no greater than %, where % is a parameter, then the request is accepted along path p. <p> This generalization means that the topological restrictions in Theorem 4.3.6 can be replaced by path length restrictions in the actual admission control and routing problem. The A G algorithm can be used to extend the admission control and routing algorithm of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> to networks where some regions of the network do not meet the bandwidth restrictions imposed by [AAP93].

In particular, consider some hierarchical backbone network G that can 79 be decomposed into a backbone network G b that meets the bandwidth restrictions of [AAP93] and several access networks G a i that may not meet the bandwidth restrictions of [AAP93]. <p> The goal of our algorithm is to maximize the number of virtual circuit requests that the network accepts. The algorithm is evaluated in the simulations of Chapter 6. Our algorithm integrates several different approaches. We use the cost-benefit framework developed as part of the admission control algorithm in <ref> [AAP93] </ref> (cf. Section 4.2). Furthermore, we extend the techniques developed in the context of reservation-based algorithms [OK85, SD94] and use these techniques to incorporate the stochastic properties of the offered traffic into the definition of the link costs used in the cost-benefit framework. <p> The difference between the starting time and the ending time is the duration of the request. The condition that enforces the capacity constraints in Definition 2.3.1 needs to be appropriately modified to account for the finite duration of the virtual circuits. In <ref> [AAP93] </ref>, Awerbuch et al. present an algorithm for the finite duration admission control and routing problem on general topology networks. <p> The final step of the algorithm is to update the state. The aap algorithm is shown in Figure 5.2. Let d be the number of links in the longest simple path in the network. The main result of <ref> [AAP93, Plo95] </ref> is that choosing = 2dr max t max =r min + 1 and % = dr max t max guarantees a competitive ratio of O (log ) = O (log (dr max t max =r min )) when r i is restricted such that r i min e fb <p> The algorithms described in this chapter will not perform well in practice if used in their present form. To perform well in practice, the multicast algorithms of this chapter need to be modified much in the same way that the unicast algorithm of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> is modified in Chapter 5. Section 7.6.1 discusses the types of modifications that are needed to make the multicast algorithms of this chapter perform well in practice. Section 7.6.1 also highlights the algorithmic principles demonstrated by the multicast algorithms in this chapter. <p> Since unicast communication is a special case of multicast communication, the (log n) lower bound of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> proves our algorithm to have the optimal competitive ratio (cf. Lemma 7.3.3). 7.3.1 Problem Statement We provide a formal definition for the admission control and routing problem for batched multicast groups. A discussion follows the definition. <p> Our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of O (log 6 n), where n is the number of nodes in the network. Since unicast communication is a special case of multicast communication, the 134 (log n) lower bound of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> applies to our algorithm (cf. Lemma 7.3.3). 7.4.1 Probabilistic Assumptions On-line multicast groups introduce two sources of complications. Complications arise from the use of non-binary admission control and from the lack of knowledge about the future multicast group membership. We discuss the complications associated with non-binary admission control first. <p> Since unicast communication is a special case of multicast communication, the (log n) lower bound of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> applies to our algorithm (cf. Lemma 7.5.4). 7.5.1 Interleaved Requests The following example illustrates why the nomg algorithm cannot handle interleaved request sequences. <p> Furthermore, for the tree and the fat-tree we provide randomized algorithms that match the oblivious lower bounds and thus beat the greedy lower bounds. For general topology networks we prove an (n) lower bound on the competitive ratio for greedy admission control algorithms. Furthermore, the aap 177 algorithm of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> and the multicast algorithms of Chapter 7 beat this (n) lower bound by achieving polylogarithmic competitive ratios. The lower bounds in [AAP93] show these algorithms to be close to optimal. The simulation results for the exp algorithm in Chapter 6 confirm the theoretical support for non-greedy admission control. <p> For general topology networks we prove an (n) lower bound on the competitive ratio for greedy admission control algorithms. Furthermore, the aap 177 algorithm of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> and the multicast algorithms of Chapter 7 beat this (n) lower bound by achieving polylogarithmic competitive ratios. The lower bounds in [AAP93] show these algorithms to be close to optimal. The simulation results for the exp algorithm in Chapter 6 confirm the theoretical support for non-greedy admission control. The following example, constructed for a hypothetical telephone network, illustrates the intuition supporting the use of non-greedy admission control. <p> Now a poor admission control decision could admit a multicast group with one member in that region instead of a multicast group with thousands of members in that region. 8.3 Open Problems General topology networks. The aap algorithm of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> provides the optimal competitive ratio for admission control and routing algorithms when every virtual circuit requests at most 1= log n fraction of the capacity of the lowest capacity link. Our general topology multicast algorithms of Chapter 7 make similar restrictions. <p> An open question is whether or not algorithms with good (polylogarith-mic) competitive ratio that do not restrict circuits to a small fraction of the link capacity exist for general topology networks. Exploiting special topologies. The competitive ratios achieved by the aap algorithm of <ref> [AAP93] </ref> and our multicast algorithms of Chapter 7 for general topology networks are polylog 181 arithmic in the size of the network. However, for certain special topologies, better competitive ratios are possible. For example, a constant competitive ratio can be achieved on symmetric loss networks.

Reference-contexts: The virtual circuits in [AAF + 93] all have infinite duration. The result is extended to virtual circuit with finite duration in [AKP + 93]. Both [AAF + 93] and [AAP93] use minimum cost routing where the cost metric is an exponential function of the link utilization [SM90]. In <ref> [ABFR94] </ref> Awerbuch, Bartal, Fiat and Rosen consider the admission control and virtual circuit routing problem on trees. Their basic algorithm focuses on virtual circuits that request the entire bandwidth of a link and have infinite duration. The algorithm is randomized and has an O (log n) competitive ratio. <p> Then, Lemma 2.5.2 extends the lower bounds to the admission control and routing problem for diameter d trees without the bandwidth and capacity restriction. We note that <ref> [ABFR94] </ref> already prove an (log d) lower bound for the unit capacity line of length d. We present our proof since it illustrates on a simple example the proof technique that we use for our lower bound results on meshes, trees of meshes fat-trees, and hypercubes.

Reference-contexts: For example, buffer space might be important for a circuit that wishes to have low data loss. A favorable position in a priority system may be important for a circuit that needs low delay. Many of these complications can be abstracted away using the concept of effective bandwidth <ref> [AG90, GAN90, EM93, EM95] </ref> (Some of the literature, e.g., [AG90, GAN90] uses the term equivalent bandwidth). Effective bandwidth essentially determines how much bandwidth a circuit should reserve based on the stochastic properties of the circuit and the QoS requirements (e.g., packet loss, delay) of the circuit. <p> A favorable position in a priority system may be important for a circuit that needs low delay.

Reference-contexts: Admission control on direct paths is greedy. However, a two-link path is used only if both links have sufficiently low utilization. The importance of using non-greedy admission control for the two-link paths in symmetric loss networks was first discussed by Krupp [Kru82] and has since received extensive attention <ref> [Aki84, MS91, MG92, MGH93] </ref>. An example of an admission control scheme based on the ideas developed in the context of symmetric loss networks is the Real Time Network Routing algorithm (RTNR) Ash et. al. [ACF + 92] used in the AT&T long distance network. <p> A key advantage of symmetric loss networks is that they permit a detailed analytic analysis. In particular, symmetric less networks tend to be modeled by fixed point equations that are easily solved numerically <ref> [Kat67, Aki84, MGH93] </ref>. Using the numerical solutions to the fixed point equations one can determine the utilization levels at which two-link paths should no longer be used. Mitra and Gibbens [MG92] provide analytic results (i.e. non-numeric) for certain asymptotic regions.

Reference-contexts: An on-line algorithm A for Q and R is a sequence of functions 2 A n from Q n to R 1 The definitions in this section borrow heavily from the approach used in <ref> [BDBK + 90] </ref>. 2 We note that functions can "solve" Turing undecidable problems. However, the problems we consider are all Turing decidable, though, in general, NP-complete. The on-line algorithms that we propose all have polynomial Turing time complexity. 25 for n 2 N, where N is the natural numbers. <p> For many problems randomized algorithms can provide much more efficient solutions than are possible with deterministic algorithms [Rab63, Rab76]. Randomization can be useful in the context of on-line algorithms <ref> [RS89, BDBK + 90] </ref>. In particular, randomization can often be used to improve the achievable performance for certain problems instead of using the probabilistic restrictions on request sequences given for probabilistic problems [Yao77]. A randomized on-line algorithm A r is simply a distribution D over deterministic algorithms. <p> The competitive ratio C a P;P (A r ) of randomized on-line algorithm A r with respect to problem P and performance function P is C a It is easy to prove the following theorem. (The proof of this theorem can be found in <ref> [BDBK + 90] </ref>.) 35 Theorem 2.5.4 If there exists a randomized on-line algorithm A r = (A; D) with adaptive competitive ratio K for some problem P and performance function P , then there exists a deterministic on-line algorithm for problem P and performance function P with competitive ratio of at

Reference-contexts: We note that these optimization goals ignore certain fairness issues. For example, node pairs that are only connected by long paths may experience a higher rate of rejection than node pairs that are connected by short paths. Other optimization goals, such as minimizing the total delay in the network <ref> [BG92] </ref> or maximizing the total accepted "value", when each virtual circuit is characterized by a "value" [AAP93], have also been discussed in the literature.

Reference-contexts: the competitive ratio measures how much the performance of the on-line algorithm suffers in comparison to the optimal algorithm due to the fact that the on-line algorithm cannot predict future requests, since, for example, it does not know the traffic pattern. 15 Competitive analysis can be extended to randomized algorithms <ref> [BLS87] </ref>, i.e., algorithms that use randomization in their decision process.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the tree established by the protocols is a shortest path tree, where the shortest path is determined by the unicast routing mechanisms. For the purpose of admission control and routing for multicast communication, the Core Based Tree (CBT) approach of Ballardie, Tsuchiya and Crowcroft <ref> [BTC92] </ref> is essentially the same as the Deering approach. However the CBT mechanism for maintaining the multicast tree in the presence of dynamically changing multicast membership is more efficient when only a small percentage of the nodes are members of the multicast group.

Reference-contexts: The network of the supercomputer is then used to route video (e.g., movies) to subscribers in real time. Oracle's Media Server, which currently runs on the NCube supercomputer, is an example of such a system <ref> [Buc94] </ref>. Each customer has a virtual circuit through the NCube that connects the disk containing the customer's movie to the customer's telecommunications port. The admission control and routing problem encompasses many service models. We focus 12 on the following models.

Reference-contexts: If some do, the packets for that multicast group are send to the new members. The protocols were developed for the Internet environment. (They are currently being used for the MBONE <ref> [Cas94] </ref>.) As a result, no resources are reserved when a new node joins a multicast group. Furthermore, the protocols have no admission control feature. For routing, the protocols make use of the underlying uni-cast routing mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, nodes communicating on the Internet may use a different path for each data packet. As a result, there are no performance guarantees and no resource reservations. However, new routing architectures currently being developed for the Internet, e.g., NIMROD <ref> [CCS94] </ref>, include facilities for virtual circuit routing. Furthermore, protocols are being developed for resource reservation and for signalling admission control decisions, e.g., RSVP [ZDE + 93].

Reference-contexts: When D = V , the Steiner Tree is equivalent to the standard minimum cost spanning tree. In general, the problem of finding the Steiner Tree is NP-complete, however polynomial time approximate solutions exist <ref> [Wax88, NT94] </ref>. Specifically, there are algorithms (cf. [KMB81]) for which the spanning tree found by the algorithm has cost at most twice the cost of the Steiner Tree.

Reference-contexts: Such a mechanism might be useful as a component of a cost based admission control algorithm. An influential set of distributed multicast protocols was developed by Deering et. al. <ref> [WDP88, DC90, Dee91, Moy92] </ref>. The focus of these protocols is the maintenance of the mul-ticast tree in the presence of dynamically changing multicast membership. <p> However the CBT mechanism for maintaining the multicast tree in the presence of dynamically changing multicast membership is more efficient when only a small percentage of the nodes are members of the multicast group. The Deering approach in <ref> [WDP88, DC90, Dee91, Moy92] </ref> and the Core Based Tree approach are combined in Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [DEF + 94]. More sophisticated approaches to routing of multicast groups are described by Noronha and Tobagi [NT94]. <p> Rather, resources along a path to the cluster need only be reserved when the first join request arrives from a node in the cluster. Reoptimization. The nomg and iomg algorithms use minimum spanning trees rather than the shortest path trees that have typically been used by the Internet community <ref> [WDP88, DC90, Dee91, Moy92] </ref>. The advantage of minimum spanning trees is the fact that they are typically much more efficient.

Reference-contexts: Randomization can be useful in the context of on-line algorithms [RS89, BDBK + 90]. In particular, randomization can often be used to improve the achievable performance for certain problems instead of using the probabilistic restrictions on request sequences given for probabilistic problems <ref> [Yao77] </ref>. A randomized on-line algorithm A r is simply a distribution D over deterministic algorithms. Definition 2.2.1 (randomized on-line algorithm) Let Q be a set of requests and R be a finite set of responses. <p> As a result, C a P A P r D (A)C P;P (A) &gt; K. Thus, we have a contradiction to the fact that there exists a randomized on-line algorithm with adaptive competitive ratio K. 2.6 Randomized Lower Bounds A result by Yao <ref> [Yao77] </ref> considerably simplifies the construction of lower bound proofs for randomized on-line algorithms. In particular, Yao notes that the complexity of randomized algorithms is connected to the complexity of deterministic algorithms on randomized inputs.

Reference-contexts: As a result, there are no performance guarantees and no resource reservations. However, new routing architectures currently being developed for the Internet, e.g., NIMROD [CCS94], include facilities for virtual circuit routing. Furthermore, protocols are being developed for resource reservation and for signalling admission control decisions, e.g., RSVP <ref> [ZDE + 93] </ref>. Parallel supercomputers are another important area where admission control and routing problems arise. Applications on parallel supercomputers often need fast access to potentially large amounts of data that is stored remotely. <p> However, we are not aware of any work that directly addresses the issue of admission control for multicast communication. However, we point to some related work. The RSVP protocol <ref> [ZDE + 93] </ref> is a signalling mechanism for admission control. The RSVP protocol assumes the existence of a separate mechanism that makes the actual admission control decisions.
