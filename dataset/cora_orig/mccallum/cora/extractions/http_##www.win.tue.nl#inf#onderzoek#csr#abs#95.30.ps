Title: The Formal Model of a Pattern Browsing Technique  
Author: Jan Hidders Cora Hoskens Jan Paredaens 
Abstract: In this report we introduce a general browsing model that describes intuitive ideas about browsing. In this model it is assumed that the database scheme, as well as the instance of the database are represented by graphs. The most important browsing step in this model is the pattern step. It is based upon finding subgraphs in the instance matching a pattern and supplied with a browsing condition that links it to previous steps. This allows the user to visually specify a browsing step based upon the results of previous steps. Other browsing steps and operators in the model allow the user to randomly select some subgraphs found by a step, replace an old browsing step with a new one or undo some of the last browsing steps. After presenting the model we compare its expressive power with that of the relational algebra.

Reference-contexts: It provides a general model to describe intuitive ideas about browsing [3], [4]. In this particular browsing model it is assumed that the database scheme, as well as the instances of the database are represented by graphs, such as in the GOOD model <ref> [1] </ref>, [5], [6]. In this model, the nodes of the graph represent objects while the edges represent the properties of and the relationships between the objects. A pattern is also a graph, and can be used to select subsets of an instance by the notion of pattern matching.

Reference-contexts: The classes are ordered in a tree structure and by means of browsing one can go from one class to one of its subclasses. Without this possibility it would be very hard to find the classes of interest. Another way of browsing is available in hypertext documents <ref> [7] </ref>. In a hypertext, links are provided to other (parts of) documents which in some way or another are related to the current document. By choosing the right links, the user tries to find the document he is interested in.

Reference-contexts: This is particularly useful when a user does not know exactly what he is looking for, or how to access the information he is looking for. An example of a browsing facility is available in Smalltalk <ref> [8] </ref>. Smalltalk provides the possibility to wander around the class structure in order to find the particular class that the user is looking for. The classes are ordered in a tree structure and by means of browsing one can go from one class to one of its subclasses.
