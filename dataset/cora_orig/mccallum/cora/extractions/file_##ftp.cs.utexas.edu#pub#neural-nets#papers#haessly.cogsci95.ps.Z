Abstract: In the barn owl, the self-organization of the auditory map of space in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) is strongly influenced by vision, but the nature of this interaction is unknown. In this paper a biologically plausible and mini-malistic model of ICx self-organization is proposed where the ICx receives a learn signal based on the owl's visual attention. When the visual attention is focused in the same spatial location as the auditory input, the learn signal is turned on, and the map is allowed to adapt. A two-dimensional Kohonen map is used to model the ICx, and simulations were performed to evaluate how the learn signal would affect the auditory map. When primary area of visual attention was shifted at different spatial locations, the auditory map shifted to the corresponding location. The shift was complete when done early in the development and partial when done later. Similar results have been observed in the barn owl with its visual field modified with prisms. Therefore, the simulations suggest that a learn signal, based on visual attention, is a possible explanation for the auditory plasticity.

Reference-contexts: In addition, these models did not address how the two-dimensional maps in the ICx could self-organize from the visual input. It has been confirmed that the synaptic changes that alter the auditory maps occur in the ICx itself, and not in the lower centers or in the optic tectum <ref> (Brainard & Knudsen, 1993) </ref>. To date, the nature of the recalibrating signal to the ICx is not well understood. In the remainder of this paper, a simple biologically plausible mechanism for the self-organization and plasticity of the ICx is proposed.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In the brain, several computational maps process sensory information. The maps transform the sensory input into a localized activity on the map, which can be easily accessed by other neural processes. These maps self-organize so that the input space is represented topologically on the map <ref> (Knudsen et al., 1987) </ref>. Typically each map is concerned with only one sensory modality. However, the barn owl is unusual in that its auditory map is strongly influenced by a different modality, vision.

Reference-contexts: For example, prisms or occluders were mounted over the owl's eyes to manipulate the visual information the owl received <ref> (Knudsen & Knudsen, 1985a) </ref>. The adaptation usually took weeks and the prisms were left on for a period of months. While the owls still had the prisms on, their auditory localization abilities were tested by having the owl orient its head directly at the location of an auditory stimulus.

Reference-contexts: The barn owl primarily uses sounds to localize its prey in the dark, and it can do this with an accuracy surpassing that of most birds and mammals <ref> (Payne, 1971) </ref>. The auditory maps that give the barn owl its extraordinary abilities are located in the inferior colliculus. There are three subdivisions of the inferior colliculus known as the central nucleus (ICc), external nucleus (ICx), and superficial nucleus (ICs).

Reference-contexts: In future work, we plan to extend the model with more realistic neurons with lateral connections where the weight modification process is completely unsupervised <ref> (e.g. Sirosh & Miikkulainen, 1994) </ref>. Furthermore, we plan to include the ICc to ICx connections, which are responsible for computing the spatial input representation from the frequency-specific inter-aural level differences (ILD) and interaural time differences (ITD).
