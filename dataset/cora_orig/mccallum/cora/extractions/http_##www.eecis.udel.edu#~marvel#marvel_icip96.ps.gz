Abstract: Robust source coding provides both compression and noise mitigation without channel coding. In this paper, two methods of robust source coding are presented. The first is DPCM incorporating a nonlinear filter; the second is Predictive Trellis-Coded Quantization (PTCQ), whose prediction filter is also nonlinear. Findings show that the incorporation of the nonlinear filter provides the ability to conceal the effects of noise and minimize the propagation of error. A comparison is made between the performance of the two methods in a noisy environment. It is demonstrated that the PTCQ scheme provides a method of least distortion at low BER. However, at higher BER the DPCM scheme outperforms PTCQ. Robust source coding of images employing PTCQ or DPCM with the nonlinear prediction filter exhibits low sensitivity to bit errors and yields, visually, a better reconstructed image after transmission over very noisy channels.

PTCQ and DPCM, incorporating a linear and nonlinear filter is investigated. This research is motivated by the original paper on PTCQ applied to speech signals by Marcellin and Fischer <ref> [1] </ref> and the recent work of Khayrallah [2] and Marvel et al. [3]. Predictive coding requires an extremely simple implementation. Although the compression rate associated with this method is low in comparison to other techniques, the low complexity and real-time imple-mentability provides an incentive for use. <p> In order to quantize the prediction error, DPCM utilizes an optimal scalar quantizer where PTCQ employs the method of TCQ that combines optimal scalar quantization with the principles of Trellis-Coded Modulation. It is well known that TCQ outperforms optimal scalar quantization <ref> [1] </ref>. Given this fact, it is logical to suspect that PTCQ will achieve a lower distortion than DPCM. By implementing a four-state PTCQ scheme operating at 3 bpp and comparing it to DPCM operating at the same rate, we found this to be true for low BER.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, the convolutional encoders utilized for trellis coding have feedback. However, encoded output from this type of trellis can result in catastrophic failure when transmitted over a noisy channel. To remedy this problem, a convolutional encoder without feedback must be used for trellis generation <ref> [4] </ref>. Fortunately, for every convolutional encoder with feedback, there exists a feedback-free encoder, for which any given input bit can affect no more that 1 + log 2 (N ) outputs, where N is defined as the number of trellis states [5].

A feedback-free convolutional encoder produces a similar trellis with the branch bits labeled differently. This construction bounds the diversion from the correct trellis path caused by a bit error and allows the intended path to be recovered. 3.

Reference-contexts: This filter is a linear combination of previous pixels. The coefficients for this filter depend only on the autocorrelation of pixels in the original image. The nonlinear filter applied here is a special case of the Ll-filter <ref> [6] </ref>. The nonlinear filter coefficients are selected based on the ranking of elements within a five-point window.
