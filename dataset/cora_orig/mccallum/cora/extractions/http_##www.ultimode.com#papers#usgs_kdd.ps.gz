Abstract: Jonathan Oliver, Ted Roush, Paul Gazis Wray Buntine, Rohan Baxter Dept. EECS NASA Ames Research Center, & Steve Waterhouse, Uni. of California, MS 245-3, Ultimode Systems, 2560 Bancroft Way #213, Berkeley, CA 94720 Moffett Field, CA 94035 Berkeley, CA 94704 jono@eecs.berkeley.edu ftroush,gazisg@mail.arc.nasa.gov fwray,rohan,stevewg@ultimode.com Abstract In the near future NASA intends to explore various regions of our solar system using robotic devices such as rovers, spacecraft, airplanes, and/or balloons. Such platforms will carry imaging devices, and a variety of analytical instruments intended to evaluate the chemical and mineralogical nature of the environment(s) that they encounter. The imaging and/or spectroscopic devices will acquire tremendous volumes of data. The communication bandwidths are restrictive enough so that only a small portion of these data can actually be returned to Earth. The aim of this research was to develop a system which analyses rock spectra to automatically determine which spectra are interesting, and to compress the spectral data for communication to Earth. In the research we report here we classify laboratory data using clustering techniques (ACPro an enhanced version of Autoclass) and provide the planetary scientists with a rapid, visually oriented method of evaluating the underlying chemical and mineralogical information contained within the clusters. We show how clustering can be used to identify interesting rock samples and estimate the compression that using such a system can achieve.

It consists of approximately 500 spectra of individual minerals, plants, and elements. Many individual minerals provide a broad compositional sampling. In some cases, reflectance measurements of many different grain size separates of the same mineral are included within the data set.

Reference-contexts: Clustering models (specifically mixture models used by ACPro) such as the ones described here may be used for data compression <ref> [14, 5] </ref>. In addition, clustering provides a method for lossy compression since if we have very low bandwidth available, we could send a vastly abbreviated summary of a data set by only sending the number of clusters and a character-isation of each cluster.
