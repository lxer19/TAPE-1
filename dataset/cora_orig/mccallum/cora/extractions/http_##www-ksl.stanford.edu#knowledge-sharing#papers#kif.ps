Abstract: Logic Group First Draft January 1992 Report Logic-92-1 Current Version June 1992 This manual is the "living document" of the Interlingua Working Group of the DARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort. As such, it represents work in progress toward a proposal for a standard knowledge interchange format.

Reference: 1. <editor> The language has declarative semantics. </editor> <title> It is possible to understand the meaning of expressions in the language without appeal to an interpreter for manipulating those expressions. In this way, KIF differs from other languages that are based on specific interpreters, such as Emycin and Prolog. </title>
Reference: 2. <editor> The language is logically comprehensive it provides for the expression of arbitrary sentences in predicate calculus. </editor> <title> In this way, it differs from relational database languages (many of which are confined to ground atomic sentences) and Prolog-like languages (that are confined to Horn clauses). </title>
Reference: 3. <editor> The language provides for the representation of knowledge about the representation of knowledge. </editor> <title> This allows us to make all knowledge representation decisions explicit and permits us to introduce new knowledge representation constructs without changing the language. In addition to these hard criteria, KIF is designed to maximize in a joint fashion the following somewhat softer measures as well (to the extent possible while satisfying the preceding criteria). </title> <type> 5 </type>
Reference: 1. <author> Translatability. </author> <title> A central operational requirement for KIF is that it enable practi-cal means of translating declarative knowledge bases to and from typical knowledge representation languages. </title>
Reference: 2. <author> Readability. </author> <title> Although KIF is not intended primarily as a language for interaction with humans, human readability facilitates its use in describing representation language semantics, its use as a publication language for example knowledge bases, its use in assisting humans with knowledge base translation problems, </title> <type> etc. </type>
