Abstract: In this paper, performance of multistage interconnection network with wormhole routing and packet switching has been evaluated for cache-coherent shared-memory multiprocessors. The traffic in cache-coherent systems is characterized by traffic bursts, one-to-many and many-to-one traffic, and small fixed length messages. The evaluation is based on execution-driven simulation using various applications. The comparison of execution time between a packet-switched and a wormhole-routed network shows that the wormhole-routed network provides significant advantage. We also evaluate wormhole networks for variable number of virtual channels and flit buffers per channel.

Reference-contexts: Thus it is desirable that the IN provides minimum latency for servicing the cache misses. Packet switching and wormhole routing networks have been widely used for multiprocessors. The performance of MINs for packet switching and wormhole networks has been evaluated in various studies <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>, based on analytical models that assume simple traffic distributions. The network traffic observed in a cache-coherent shared-memory multiprocessor is characterized by invalidation messages, bursty requests, memory hot-spots, and fixed message sizes. <p> Also, we implement a directory-based cache-coherence protocol [4] in our simulator and realistic synchronization techniques [5]. Virtual channels <ref> [1] </ref> are used in wormhole networks to avoid deadlocks and to improve link utilization and network throughput. In a recent paper [6], we evaluated virtual channels in 2-D torus wormhole networks and showed that they improve performance considerably.

Reference-contexts: Also, we implement a directory-based cache-coherence protocol <ref> [4] </ref> in our simulator and realistic synchronization techniques [5]. Virtual channels [1] are used in wormhole networks to avoid deadlocks and to improve link utilization and network throughput. In a recent paper [6], we evaluated virtual channels in 2-D torus wormhole networks and showed that they improve performance considerably. <p> For packet switching, the packets were 8 bytes long (1-header, 7-data), so a packet sees a delay of (1+4) cycles for switching and transmission to the next stage. 2.3 Cache coherence protocol and synchronization We implemented the full-map directory-based cache coherence protocol <ref> [4] </ref> for evaluation in this paper. In this scheme, each shared memory block is assigned to a node, called home node, which maintains the directory entries for that block. Each entry in the directory is a bit-vector of same length as the number of nodes.

The protocol has been modified to make it work in a network that does not guarantee in-order delivery of messages.
