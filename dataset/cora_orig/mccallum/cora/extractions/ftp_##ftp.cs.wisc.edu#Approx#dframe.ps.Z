Abstract: The fiberization of affine systems via dual Gramian techniques, that was developed in previous papers of the authors, is applied here for the study of affine frames which have an affine dual system. Gramian techniques are also used to verify whether a dual pair of affine frames is a also a pair of bi-orthogonal Riesz bases. A general method for a painless derivation of a dual pair of affine frames from an arbitrary MRA is obtained via the mixed extension principle.

Reference-contexts: The refinability assumption is equivalent to the nestedness assumption V j V j+1 , all j. We mention in passing two other popular conditions in the wavelet literature: the first is that " j2ZZ V j = 0. That condition was shown in x4 of <ref> [BDR2] </ref> to follow from the refinability assumption (together with the fact that 2 L 2 ). The second condition is that [ j2ZZ V j is dense in L 2 (IR d ).

But, first, let us introduce wavelets systems and their celebrated fiberization. 1.3. <p> The focus in this paper is on such systems. While extending the tight frame results of [RS3] to this more general setup, we had to deal with several problems of different nature: (a): The systems that were analyzed in <ref> [RS1] </ref> were not only assumed to be shift-invariant, but, also, the fiberized operators were assumed to be self-adjoint (a condition that is certainly valid for T X T fl X T X ); in fact, the main results of [RS1] fail to hold without this assumption. <p> problems of different nature: (a): The systems that were analyzed in <ref> [RS1] </ref> were not only assumed to be shift-invariant, but, also, the fiberized operators were assumed to be self-adjoint (a condition that is certainly valid for T X T fl X T X ); in fact, the main results of [RS1] fail to hold without this assumption. When dealing with a system-dual system relation, the operators that are fiberized are not self-adjoint.

In x2.1, we establish those minor extensions that are required in this paper. The reader may skip this technical section without an essential loss of continuity. <p> For the intended simultaneous study of two systems, X and RX, we need to multiply the pre-Gramian of one of these systems by the adjoint pre-Gramian of the other system. We call the resulting matrices the mixed Gramian matrices. We will then need some extensions of the results of <ref> [RS1] </ref> concerning the Gramian matrices to the new mixed setup.

The reason for that is that the analysis in <ref> [RS3] </ref> led to simple `extension principles' for constructing tight affine frames, and these simple principles led further to the constructions of a wealth of concrete tight wavelet frames. In this paper, we focus on the theory of general affine systems, quasi-affine systems, and their dual counterparts. <p> An affine system is invariant under the dilation operator D, but is not shift-invariant. At the same time, our fiberization techniques require X to be shift-invariant. We had circumvented this difficulty in <ref> [RS3] </ref> with the aid of the notions of the truncated affine system X 0 and the quasi-affine system X q of an affine system: 5 Definition: the truncated affine system. Let X be an affine system generated by . <p> Note that the normalization factor j det sj k=2 is &lt; 1. The main result of <ref> [RS3] </ref> is as follows. Result 1.9. Let X be an affine system, and X q its quasi-affine counterpart. Then: (a) X is a Bessel system if and only if X q is a Bessel system. (b) X is a frame if and only if X q is a frame. <p> Moreover, the two frames have the same upper frame bound and the same lower frame bound. In particular, X is a tight frame if and only if X q is a tight frame. We remark that the original theorem in <ref> [RS3] </ref> assumes the following very mild smoothness condition on : (1:10) 2 k=0 where for every k 2 ZZ + , A k := fff 2 2ZZ d : jffj &gt; 2 k g; and X j b ( + ff)j 2 k L 1 ([;] d ) : It is <p> In order to obtain concrete results along these lines, one needs first to represent the quasi-affine system X q () as a shift-invariant system E (F ), and then to compute the dual Gramian fibers. This technical step was carried out in <ref> [RS3] </ref>. <p> (ff; fi) = 2 k=(fffi) b (s flk (! + ff)) b (s flk (! + fi)); where is the s fl -valuation function (!) := inffk 2 ZZ : s flk ! 2 2ZZ d g: Anticipating an extensive use of such expressions in wavelet analysis, we introduced in <ref> [RS3] </ref> the following affine product: [!; ! 0 ] = 2 k=(!! 0 ) Thus, in terms of the affine product, the dual Gramian entry is [! + ff; ! + fi]. <p> However, there is a certain amount of redundancy in the so-obtained conditions. After removing those redundancies, one obtains the following characterization of tight affine frames. We note that this result was obtained independently by Bin Han in [H]: Result 1.11. ([H], <ref> [RS3] </ref>) Let X be an affine system generated by . <p> Fiberization of affine frames: MRA The use of multiresolution analysis allows one to derive from the abstract results of the previous subsection useful algorithms for constructing tight and other affine frames. In <ref> [RS3] </ref>, it is assumed that the MRA may be generated by a vector of scaling functions (i.e., it is an FSI MRA). However, for all practical considerations that we discuss here, it suffices to consider the PSI case, i.e., that of a singleton scaling function. <p> We can then substitute the above relations into the affine product expression, combine that with Result 1.11, and obtain in this way a characterization of all tight affine frames that can be constructed by MRA (cf. Theorem 6.5 of <ref> [RS3] </ref>). From that characterization, it is easy to conclude the following unitary extension principle: Result 1.12. Let be a refinable function with bounded mask t , and assume that b (0) = 1. <p> There are then two conditions here. The first is that t (!) has a unit length, and the other is that t (!) is orthogonal to t (! + ). Concrete constructions that use this extension principle are given in <ref> [RS3] </ref>, [RS4] and [GR]. In [RS3], we selected the refinable function to be the univariate B-spline of order m, and found m compactly supported mother wavelets (in V 1 , i.e., having the half integers as their knots) all symmetric (or anti-symmetric) that generate a tight frame. <p> There are then two conditions here. The first is that t (!) has a unit length, and the other is that t (!) is orthogonal to t (! + ). Concrete constructions that use this extension principle are given in <ref> [RS3] </ref>, [RS4] and [GR].

The focus in this paper is on such systems. While extending the tight frame results of <ref> [RS3] </ref> to this more general setup, we had to deal with several problems of different nature: (a): The systems that were analyzed in [RS1] were not only assumed to be shift-invariant, but, also, the fiberized operators were assumed to be self-adjoint (a condition that is certainly valid for T X T <p> The reader may skip this technical section without an essential loss of continuity. In the subsequent section, x2.2, we introduce the mixed affine product and describe the dual Gramian fibers of the mixed operators; these, too, can be considered as straightforward technical extensions of the <ref> [RS3] </ref> analysis. (b): As explained before, it is the quasi-affine system which is really fiberized; conclusions concerning the affine X then follow with the aid of Result 1.9. This result, however, lacks assertions concerning possible connections between dual systems of affine frames and dual systems of their quasi-affine counterparts. <p> This still requires one to check in advance that the systems in question are Bessel. No new techniques for verifying this property are given in the current paper. However, in addition to being characterized fully in <ref> [RS3] </ref> (cf. Theorem 5.5 there), simple sufficient conditions for the Bessel property of an affine X are known (see e.g. [RS6]). Roughly speaking, all these results say that a system X is Bessel if the corresponding mother wavelets are smooth (in a mild sense) and have zero-mean values. <p> With all these in hand, we analyze, in x3.2, affine systems constructed by MRA. The analysis in this part extends the analysis of MRA constructions of tight affine frames that was made in x6 of <ref> [RS3] </ref>.

These techniques differ from the Gramian approaches used in [RS6] and [RS3]. Finally, the study of bi-orthogonal wavelet constructions from MRA is the topic of x4.2. 2. The mixed Gramian matrices 2.1. Two technical lemmata The Gramian matrices of a given shift-invariant system X were obtained as the product of the pre-Gramian matrix and its adjoint. <p> This ensures us that the mixed Gramian matrices of X q and (RX) q are well-defined (as discussed in the previous subsection). The details of these matrices are provided below, but we omit here the actual computations of these mixed dual Gramian fibers: the derivation follow verbatim that of <ref> [RS3] </ref> (where the case RX = X is studied). <p> In a way entirely analogous to the computation in Proposition 5.1 of <ref> [RS3] </ref>, we obtain the following: Lemma 2.8. Let X and RX be two affine Bessel systems generated by and R, respectively. Let e G ! , ! 2 IR d , be the !-fiber of the mixed dual Gramian of the shift-invariant (Bessel) systems X q and (RX) q . <p> Since RX is dual to X, T RX T fl X = I. Now, let T fl 0;r be the restriction of the operator T fl XnX 0 to H r (X 0 is the truncated affine system, as defined in x1.3). By Lemma 4.7 of <ref> [RS3] </ref>, there exists, for any given " &gt; 0, r such that kT fl 0;r k &lt; " (cf. display (4.9) and display (4.10) in the proof of that lemma). <p> Since T RX is assumed bounded, it follows that, on H r , kT RX 0 T fl 14 At the same time, Lemma 5.4 of <ref> [RS3] </ref> shows that, for large r, kT fl X q nX 0 k " on H r , and thus, on H r , X q Ik " 00 : Therefore, Lemma 3.2 implies that (RX) q is a dual system for X q . <p> Further, the correspondence between the elements of X q and Y q induces a similar correspondence R : X ! Y . We need to prove that T RX T fl X = I. For that we fix " &gt; 0, and invoke Lemma 5.4 of <ref> [RS3] </ref> to find a sufficiently large r such that kT fl X q nX 0 k " on H r . <p> This will lead to simple, useful principles for constructing affine frames. For simplicity, we assume throughout this section that the MRA is generated by a single scaling function. The analysis, however, can be adapted to cover the case of multiple scaling functions (as already indicated in x6 of <ref> [RS3] </ref> in the context of tight frames). At the heart of each MRA sits a function 2 L 2 (IR d ) which is known as a scaling function or a refinable function or a father wavelet. <p> Our MRA constructions in <ref> [RS3] </ref> deviates from this classical approach: while still selecting the mother wavelets from V 1 , the shifts of those mother wavelets do not complement those of . In fact, in most of our constructions, the space W 0 is dense in V 1 . <p> In fact, in most of our constructions, the space W 0 is dense in V 1 . At the same time, our results here and in <ref> [RS3] </ref> suggest that successful constructions of affine frames and their dual systems may be carried out under minimal assumptions on the scaling functions and/or their masks. <p> 2 0 , we define a (rectangular) matrix whose rows are indexed by 0 and whose columns are indexed by Z as follows: (3:8) := (E - t ) 2 0 ;-2Z : Based on the results of x3.1, we can extend the MRA constructions of tight affine frames (of <ref> [RS3] </ref>) to the system/dual system setup.

Let and R be two scaling functions corresponding to MRAs (V j ) j and (V d j ) j , respectively. <p> The spirit in this section is significantly different from previous approaches we chose for the analysis of affine Riesz bases (cf. [RS6] and x4 of <ref> [RS3] </ref>). Our previous techniques were based on a direct analysis of the synthesis operator T X using `Gramian methods'. <p> The result is in terms of system-dual system. We could also obtain a similar result intrinsically in terms of the given affine system X (without searching for a dual system first) using our characterization of affine frames in <ref> [RS3] </ref>. We forgo mentioning this additional result since the scope of this paper is limited to the study of system-dual system setups. Theorem 4.11. Let L 2 , and let R : !

The extra conditions (a,c,d) become then redundant. 4.2. MRA: Riesz bases In this subsection we assume that two Bessel systems, X and RX, are constructed via MRA using the mixed extension principle, Theorem 3.9. <p> Corollary 4.5). If the system was constructed according to the mixed extension principle, then these conditions are equivalent to a single condition on the scaling function. This result extends Corollary 6.9 in <ref> [RS3] </ref>. Corollary 4.14. Let X and RX be two dual frames that were constructed according to the mixed extension principle.

Reference-contexts: Previous papers on the matter include [RS1] where the framework of our fiberization techniques is established, [RS2] where Weyl-Heisenberg systems are analyzed, [RS3] where the theory of affine frames, and in particular tight affine frames, is developed, and <ref> [RS4] </ref> where that theory is invoked for the construction of multivariate tight affine frames generated by compactly supported splines of arbitrary smoothness. Other investigations and/or applications of these fiberization techniques can be found in [RS5-6] and [GR]. The present paper is devoted to affine systems, also known as wavelet systems. <p> There are then two conditions here. The first is that t (!) has a unit length, and the other is that t (!) is orthogonal to t (! + ). Concrete constructions that use this extension principle are given in [RS3], <ref> [RS4] </ref> and [GR]. In [RS3], we selected the refinable function to be the univariate B-spline of order m, and found m compactly supported mother wavelets (in V 1 , i.e., having the half integers as their knots) all symmetric (or anti-symmetric) that generate a tight frame. In [RS4] various multivariate constructions <p> given in [RS3], <ref> [RS4] </ref> and [GR]. In [RS3], we selected the refinable function to be the univariate B-spline of order m, and found m compactly supported mother wavelets (in V 1 , i.e., having the half integers as their knots) all symmetric (or anti-symmetric) that generate a tight frame. In [RS4] various multivariate constructions of compactly supported spline wavelets that are derived from a box spline are discussed (in fact, it is shown there that, essentially, such a tight frame can be derived from any given refinable box spline). <p> For example, we show there how to construct a tight frame using the Zwart-Powell element (which is a C 1 piecewise-quadratic and has four direction mesh lines of symmetry; the wavelets have these four lines of symmetry/anti-symmetry, too). The constructions of <ref> [RS4] </ref> apply to dilation matrices that satisfy s k = aI, for some integer k. For a general dilation matrix s, tight compactly supported affine frames of arbitrarily high smoothness were constructed in [GR]. Those frames are not piecewise-polynomial in general. 1.5. <p> RX are Bessel, and (b) fl d = I, a.e., then X and RX are fundamental frames that are dual one to the other. 17 With Theorem 3.9 in hand, one can construct compactly supported spline frames with com-pactly supported dual (spline) frames by simply modifying the algorithm provided in <ref> [RS4] </ref>, where compactly supported spline tight frames were constructed. 4. Affine Riesz bases 4.1. Riesz bases and minimal dual systems In this subsection, we record some observations concerning minimal dual frames and Riesz bases that are not confined to affine systems, and then apply those to affine systems.
