Abstract: In order to realize real-time communication over Ethernet or fast Ethernet, one has to be able to control packet delay within an acceptable bound. Because of its multiple access nature, it is impossible to guarantee a deterministic medium access time to individual stations that are connected to an Ethernet. This, in turn, makes Ethernet impossible to provide a bounded packet delay. However, one can bound the medium access time statistically by limiting the packet arrival rate at the medium access control layer. In this paper, we consider the connection admission control (CAC) problem for statistically bounding the medium access time of Ethernet. Specifically, a packet is guaranteed to have a medium access time smaller than a predefined bound with a certain probability. Our approach employs a middleware layer to execute the admission control in the packet level instead of modifying the current standard of the medium access control protocol of Ethernet. In order to determine an appropriate input level to achieve a given packet-loss or deadline-miss rate, we derive the probability of transmitting a packet successfully upon each trial by modeling the medium access protocol, 1-persistent CSMA/CD, and the collision resolution protocol, Binary Exponential Backoff, of Ethernet. Using an indepth simulation study, we have shown this analytic model to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of packet-loss (or deadline-miss) rate over Fast Ethernet.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this approach severely under-utilizes network resources because it usually reserves resources based on each client's worst-case traffic-generation behavior. For packet-switching networks, there are two widely-known approaches to supporting real-time communication: deterministic and statistical <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The deterministic approach provides "absolute" performance guarantees by reserving resources based on each client's worst-case traffic generation behavior as in the circuit-switching approach. Thus, it too severely under-utilizes network resources. <p> By contrast, the statistical approach allows a certain percentage of packets to be lost or miss deadlines, but improves network utilization significantly. As a result, clients receive only "probabilistic" QoS guarantees. Numerous deterministic and statistical schemes have been proposed to support real-time communication over WAN <ref> [1, 3-10] </ref> and LANs like FDDI [11, 12] and FieldBus [13]. Despite the numerous newly-emerging or existing high-speed networks, the predominant LAN architecture is still, and will in future be, based on Ethernet, due mainly to its maturity, low-cost, and wide deployment & acceptance. <p> Before describing our model, let's examine the operation of BEB briefly. When a packet collides with another packet, BEB sets the backoff time for the packet indicating when to try its retransmission. The backoff time is randomly chosen from <ref> [0; 1; ; 2 n1 ] </ref>fi slot time, where n is the number of collisions the collided packet has experienced and slot time is 512 bit times (in Ethernet, 51.2 secs, and in Fast Ethernet, 5.12 secs).

Reference-contexts: In addition to the most popular 10-Mbps standard Ethernet, newer generations of Ethernets such as 100 Base-T and 100 Base-VG have already been spreading widely in the commercial market <ref> [14] </ref>. It is a general belief that Ethernet will continue to be the network of choice in a LAN environment, especially at end-host clusters. Moreover, the low price and the availability of Ethernet device drivers on almost all operating systems make it attractive even for embedded systems like automated factories.

Reference-contexts: Most of earlier work in the area of supporting real-time communication over Ethernet focused on modifying the MAC layer so that a bounded channel access time may be achieved [15-18]. Employing tokens for medium access control is one of such examples <ref> [18] </ref>. This approach is quite costly compared to using the well-established and widely-used current Ethernet standard. Another way to achieve bounded channel access time is to use full duplex Ethernet switches instead of ordinary shared Ethernet hubs. This approach is also expensive compared to using shared Ethernet hubs.

Reference-contexts: However, the throughput and average delay analysis is not enough nor acceptable in realizing real-time communication. Realization of real-time communication requires the knowledge of the tail distribution of packet delay rather than such average performance parameters. Beuerman and Coyle <ref> [19] </ref> derived the tail distribution of packet delay in a non-persistent CSMA/CD protocol, assuming that the average waiting time for retransmission is sufficiently larger than packet transmission time. However, the characteristic of the 1-persistent CSMA/CD protocol combined with BEB is quite different from their result on the non-persistent version.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, a statistical real-time channel is defined as a unidirectional virtual circuit that guarantees the timely delivery of packets in statistical terms, i.e., the probability that a packet is lost during its transmission or misses its delivery deadline is less than a certain loss tolerance, Z <ref> [20] </ref>: P r (end-to-end packet loss) Z; (2.1) or P r (packet delay &gt; delay bound) Z: (2.2) Unlike WAN or other LANs (e.g., FDDI and FieldBus), Ethernet cannot control the medium access time of individual stations or connections.

Reference-contexts: The traffic source of Ethernet consists of an infinite number of users who collectively form an independent Poisson source with an aggregate mean packet-generation rate of packets/sec. This assumption is introduced to make our analysis tractable, and has been widely used for the performance analysis of contention-based MAC protocols <ref> [21] </ref>. This proved to be valid when the number of stations is sufficiently large, e.g., over 20. <p> Note that g is the rate of both new packet arrivals and retransmission trials in QUIET mode. Since we have two channel offered traffic rates, g and fi in our model, Figure 3 must read differently from the results in <ref> [21, 22] </ref>. Figure 3 indicates the relation between g and the input load from outside the system. We determine g from Figure 3, given the input load, using the steady-state condition assumption as discussed in Section 3.2. Unlike g, fi is a fixed parameter that is independent of the throughput.

Reference-contexts: However, once a collision occurs, the channel offered traffic rate increases abruptly due to the small backoff time, the probability of another collision 1 this modeling draws on Vo-Dai's work <ref> [22] </ref> which we modified to accommodate the bursty nature of Ethernet traffic 5 when they are scheduled for retransmissions is very high. BURST mode is introduced to represent this situation. We can analyze the behavior of Ethernet in BURST mode by considering the worst-case scenario in terms of collisions. <p> In state 3 of Figure 2, t 3 + Y indicates the latest transmission initiated within the contention period. See <ref> [22] </ref> for a detailed account of derivation of G (x). Note that G (x) depends on the packet-arrival rate in both contention states 2 and 6. <p> Note that g is the rate of both new packet arrivals and retransmission trials in QUIET mode.
