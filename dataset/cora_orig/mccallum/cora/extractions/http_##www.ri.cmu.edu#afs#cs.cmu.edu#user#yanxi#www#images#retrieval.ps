Reference-contexts: described below. 3D Symmetry Plane Detector: Since normal human brains present an approximate bilateral symmetry, which is often absent in pathological brains, a symmetry detector is constructed to automatically extract the ideal midsagittal plane (the plane X 0 = 0, see Figure 1) from a 3D, probably pathologic, brain image <ref> [17] </ref>. The basic idea is to find the transformation that brings a given 3D brain scan and its bilateral reflection (also a 3D image) into the best matching position.
