Abstract: This paper describes work carried out at University College London to integrate public narrow-band ISDN services into the Internet world. The aim of the work is to provide a gateway that allows access to global Internet resources for users with Basic Rate ISDN access. The gateway not only supports traditional data applications but also newer multimedia, multicast applications such as VAT and WB. A subsidiary aim is to make it possible for a PSTN user to dial-in and join an Internet VAT conference

Primary Rate access is now generally available in the UK. Installation costs about $1500 for 30 channels plus the cost of installing the cable - which could be as much as $20,000. Rental is about $20 per month per channel.

Reference-contexts: The Spyder implements the 32 ISDN sub-channels and provides HDLC support. In order to be able to interwork with a variety of ISDN equipment, the UPI supports several different methods for transporting IP datagrams over ISDN B-channels. These include PPP <ref> [6] </ref> and HDLC core 1 plus some proprietary ones. Generally the software tries to guess which encapsulation is being used by inspecting the incoming datagrams. A demand-driven strategy is used to control ISDN call setup. The first outgoing datagram for a particular destination triggers the setup of a single B-channel.

We do not use any of the error-control or flow-control procedures. open approach is discernible with quite wide support for the CAPI API <ref> [7] </ref> to provide a standard software interface to the ISDN hardware. Our original PC cards were from the British company kn-X and use a proprietary protocol over the ISDN which emulates an Ethernet bridge.

Reference-contexts: Recently we have begun to use the Teles S0 card. This is much cheaper (around $400) and, in principle, less powerful. It supports the CAPI interface and this enables us to use the ISPA packet driver <ref> [8] </ref> and Trumpet Winsock [9] software. These two are shareware products available at a reasonable cost. Together they support the industry standard winsock API which is used by most Internet software written for the Windows environment. Examples include the Eudora mail processing system, and the Mosaic and Netscape web browsers.

Reference-contexts: The throughput we achieve seems to depend largely on the quality of the TCP implementation in use. Here the PC/Windows implementations (Trumpet Winsock and CUTCP <ref> [10] </ref>) come off poorly in comparison with the Unix ones. We suspect this may be due to the baroque scheduling and buffering mechanisms inside DOS/Windows rather than to the TCP code itself.

Reference-contexts: Since it is provided by the network rather than the users equipment it is not trivial to spoof. We are now gradually moving towards PPP as a standard encapsulation protocol and we will support the authentication extension it provides <ref> [11] </ref>. This will provide us with some measure of security when CLIP is unavailable - as presently for some international calls. We have to care also for outgoing calls since these cost us real money.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we describe the approach we have taken towards support for these services through the UPI.

This work is described in <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> We have found that Linear Predictive Encoding at 9Kbps is quite intelligible between a pair of Sun 4s - so there is still some bandwidth available for the whiteboard. Whilst we have conducted experiments allowing multimedia conferencing using the ISDN by using a central switch control <ref> [12] </ref>, we have yet to mount a large-scale experiment using IP multicast with home/teleworkers. We hope to do this in the next phase of our experiments. Data and Telecom. ISDN Gateway Proc. INET '95 G. Knight, S. Bhatti, S.

Reference-contexts: However, since ISDN is quite costly, we must avoid making unnecessary ISDN calls. 5.1 The multicast backbone - MBONE With IP multicasting, group D addresses are used, with each address identifying a global distributed group rather than a single host. Any host with suitable extensions <ref> [13] </ref> can receive and transmit multicast datagrams. However, to provide the correct forwarding for these packets across the whole of the Internet requires a backbone infrastructure providing global connectivity and correct routing for the multicast packets [14].

Reference-contexts: Any host with suitable extensions [13] can receive and transmit multicast datagrams.

This connectivity is provided by a number of special routers, most of which implement the distance vector multicast routing protocol (DVMRP) [15, 16].

Reference-contexts: However, this is an inelegant solution and requires cooperation at both ends of the ISDN connection. What is required is for an explicit graft soft-state rather than explicit prune soft-state. Such a solution may be offered by the sparse mode model of the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) <ref> [17] </ref> approach. 5.3 An experimental setup The UPI is not multicast-aware, so we must provide the multicast routing to the remote ISDN home/teleworkers by the use of multicast tunnels. These use IP-in-IP encapsulation, wrapping the multicast packet up in a unicast packet to traverse the tunnel.

This calculates a security checksum on each packet by applying the MD5 [20] algorithm to the payload of the packet concatenated with a shared secret value. It is computationally infeasible to calculate such a checksum correctly without knowing the secret value.
