Title: A ROBUST AND EFFICIENT NUMERICAL METHOD FOR NONLINEAR PROTEIN MODELING EQUATIONS  
Author: MICHAEL HOLST 
Abstract: We present a robust and efficient numerical method for solution of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation arising in molecular biophysics. The equation is discretized with the box method, and solution of the discrete equations is accomplished with a global inexact-Newton method, combined with linear multilevel techniques we have described in a previous paper. A detailed analysis of the resulting method is presented, with comparisons to other methods that have been proposed in the literature, including the classical nonlinear multigrid method, the nonlinear conjugate gradient method, and nonlinear relaxation methods such as SOR. Both theoretical and numerical evidence suggests that this method will converge in the case of molecules for which many of the existing methods will not. In addition, for problems which the other methods are able to solve, numerical experiments show that this method is substantially more efficient, and the superiority of this method grows with the problem size. The method is very easy to implement once a linear multilevel solver is available, and can also easily be used in conjuction with linear methods other than multigrid.

Reference-contexts: The idea here, motivated by the work of Bank and Rose <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, is to combine the robust damped inexact-Newton methods with the fast linear multilevel solvers developed by Holst and Saied [31] and Holst [29, 28] for the inexact Jacobian system solves. <p> Combination with linear multilevel iterative methods for the semiconductor problem has been considered by Bank and Rose [5], along with questions of complexity. In a paper of Bank and Rose <ref> [4] </ref>, an analysis of inexact-Newton methods is performed, where a damping parameter has been introduced. A quite sophisticated algorithm GLOBAL is constructed, enforcing both global and superlinear convergence properties; the sufficient descent condition established above is implicitly imbedded in their algorithm GLOBAL.

Numerical Comparisons The global inexact-Newton-multilevel method presented earlier is investigated numerically when applied to the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation and to a nonlinear test problem with large jump discontinuities in the coefficients and exponential nonlinearity.

Reference-contexts: By this last comment, we see that if kF (u n )k &lt; 1 and C 1, then the full inexact-Newton step is a descent direction, and since we attempt this step first, we see that our algorithm reduces to the algorithm studied by Dembo et al. <ref> [14] </ref> near the solution; therefore, Theorem 5.1 above applies to Algorithm 5.2 near the solution without modification. Note that due to the special form of the nonlinear operator arising in the discrete nonlinear PBE, the damping step can be implemented in a surprisingly efficient manner.
