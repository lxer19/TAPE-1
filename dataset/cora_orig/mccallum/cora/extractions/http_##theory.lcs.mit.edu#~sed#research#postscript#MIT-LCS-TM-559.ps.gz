Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the three-dimensional folding of a protein given its one-dimensional amino acid sequence. The model we use is based on the Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model [2] on cubic lattices in which the goal is to find the fold with the maximum number of contacts between non-covalently linked hydrophobic amino acids. Hart and Istrail [5] give a 3/8 approximation algorithm for folding proteins on the cubic lattice. Since the cubic lattice exhibits the parity problem (described below), we instead consider folding proteins on a different lattice: the three-dimensional triangular lattice. For this lattice, Decatur and Batzoglou [1] give a simple linear time algorithm which achieves a 16/30 asymptotic approximation. In this work, we further improve the model by generalizing the HP model to account for hydrophobic residues with different levels of hydrophobicity. After describing the motivation for this generalization of the model, we show that in new model we are able to achieve the same constant factor approximation guarantee on the triangular lattice as was achieved in the standard HP model.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2, we describe the parity problem as well as the triangular lattices in more detail. Decatur and Batzoglou <ref> [1] </ref> give a simple linear time algorithm for folding a protein on a three-dimensional triangular lattice which asymptotically guarantees a score at least 16=30 53% of the optimal. This algorithm, which we later adapt, is presented in Section 3. <p> This may only increase the optimal score by 1 and is therefore ignored for our asymptotic analysis. 4 3 The Binary HP Construction on the 3D Triangular Lattice The folding algorithm of Decatur and Batzoglou <ref> [1] </ref> for the three-dimensional triangular lattice places all hydrophobic residues in a single, tightly-packed, hydrophobic core. The core is composed of six residues at each level and contains as many levels as is necessary to accommodate all hydrophobic residues in the protein.

Reference-contexts: Due to the complexity of the protein folding problem, scientists have studied a variety of simplifications of the general problem. Dill <ref> [2] </ref> introduced one such model, called the Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) Model. fl Supported by a grant from the Reed Foundation through the MIT School of Science.

Reference-contexts: The protein is hypothesized to fold in such a way as to minimize the surface area of hydrophobic residues exposed to water or polar residues. The HP model has been studied extensively and Dill et.al. <ref> [3] </ref> review much of the research in this and related models. From a computational point of view, it is not known whether or not the problem of finding the fold with maximum score is NP-hard. Hart and Istrail [5] gave the first approximation algorithm for this problem.

Reference-contexts: Yet it is well known that different types of hydrophobic residues are more strongly hydrophobic than others. In fact, scientists have developed many such hydrophobicity scales in order to quantify the relative hydrophobicity of amino acids. (See for example Kyte and Doolittle [6] or Engelman, Steitz and Goldman <ref> [4] </ref>.) We therefore propose an extension of the hydrophobic-polar model which accounts for residues of differing levels of hydrophobicity. 3 In the new model, we allow each of the 20 amino acids to have a value from the set f0; 1; 2; : : :g.

Reference-contexts: As a step towards establishing the NP-hardness of this problem, a related model has been proposed by Paterson and Przytycka <ref> [7] </ref> in which there is an unlimited alphabet of residue types and only contacts between identical types make unit contribution to the energy function. In their model, they show that finding the optimal energy fold on a cubic lattice is NP-hard.
