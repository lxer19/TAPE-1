Abstract: Let A be an irreducible stochastic matrix of the form small, and the states are said to be nearly transient. It this paper it is shown that small relative perturbations in A 11 , A 21 , and A 22 , though potentially larger than y T y Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.

Reference-contexts: becomes small, the approximations that lead to (1.1) become increasingly inaccurate and break down entirely when ff = O (*). (This break-down agrees with what we know about the perturbation theory for nearly completely decomposable chains, where the steady Nearly Transient Chains 3 state vector is sensitive to such perturbations <ref> [2] </ref>.) In generalizing the result, however, it is not be enough to require that A 21 = O (1), and we will formulate an alternate condition in terms of A 22 . Finally, we note that the perturbation in the example does not leave the matrix stochastic.

Hence k1 k ky 1 k + O ( 2 ) + O (*). Thus if ~ ~ A = ~ A = (1 )I, then ~ ~ A comes from a perturbation of A whose norm is asymptotically bounded by (1 + ky T 1 k).
