Abstract: The flip-chip technology for multi-chip modules provides area pads through solder bumps which are distributed over the entire chip surface. Clock skew has been identified as one of major limiting factors for high speed VLSI systems. We propose a two level clock routing scheme for a MCM-packaged VLSI system by making use of area pads and high connectivity of MCM substrate. The die is partitioned small isochronal regions with a area pad assigned for each bin. We implement the clock network of the MCM system in two levels. A global clock network with longer wires is routed on the MCM substrate which connects the clock source of the module to all clock area pads of dice. Inside every isochronous bin of a die, a delay-bounded clock tree is constructed from clock pad to clocked elements. Experimental results show this two level clock routing scheme dramatically reduces the clock wires and achieves high clocking performance of the whole MCM system.

Reference-contexts: So, to achieve the frequency higher than 200MHZ, the clock skew should be controlled under 0:25ns. This small skew should also be maintained for a digital system with several chips and multiple clock phases such as in multi-chip modules. The "H" clock tree has been used in IC industry <ref> [3] </ref>. However, it is only applicable for symmetric arrays of logic elements. Some research work has been done involving the construction of a clock tree based on the general distribution of clock terminals. <p> However, on the state-of-art MCM substrate, the resistive effect still dominates the inductive phenomena such that the interconnect on the substrate functions as a lossy transmission line. Given a branch with width w i , we get the resistance R and capacitance C of a unit length line <ref> [3] </ref> as R = fl=w i ; C = fiw i (3:1) 8 3.

Reference-contexts: If T c and T d are optimum, T b should have less total edge length than T d and more total edge length than T c . But, since T c is obtained based on a approximation algorithm <ref> [16] </ref>, it is showed in Table 5.2 and Table 5.3 that l b is less than l c in most examples.

Reference-contexts: According to circuit theory, the voltage waveforms at the terminals of a clock network will be changed. Skew may be reduced if we update the wire widths in such a way that the waveforms at the clock terminals have less difference in rise/fall time. In <ref> [24] </ref>, the optimal sizing of a general clock network can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem which minimizes the clock skew in a feasible set of widths. This feasible set of branch widths is decided by 4. Local Clock Routing in Die 9 the fabrication technology and routing resource. <p> This feasible set of branch widths is decided by 4. Local Clock Routing in Die 9 the fabrication technology and routing resource. By turning skew minimization problem into a least-squares estimation problem, a modified Gauss-Marquardt's method proposed in <ref> [24] </ref> is used to determine the optimal widths of clock wires. An efficient algorithm is also proposed that assigns the good initial widths for a clock tree which let the later iterative optimization process converge more quickly. <p> We apply the sizing optimization method on the global clock tree based on lossy transmission line interconnect model as expressed on (3.1) and (3.2).

We take the electrical parameters of chip in [4], and electrical parameters of a advanced thin-film MCM substrate in <ref> [24] </ref>. These parameters are listed in Table 5.1. We size the driver at clock area pad resulting in two output resistances R d = 100 and R d = 50 to test the effect of driver sizing on the Steiner tree construction. <p> The planar clock tree toplogy on the MCM substrate is shown in dash lines in Figure 5.1 (a). The clock skew on the substrate can be further reduced by assigning variable wire widths. We apply the sizing optimization method in <ref> [24] </ref> to size the clock wires on the substrate bounded between 10m ~ 50m. The final skew is reduced to 0:07ns. Figure 5.2 (a) shows the simulation voltage waveforms at clock area pads of the global clock tree on the substrate. The result is summarized in Table 5.4.
