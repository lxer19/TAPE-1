Title: Kin Selection and Cooperating Agents

Abstract: Kin selection is a theory that attempts to explain the apparently altruistic behaviour in nature. It suggests that self-sacrifice in order to save kin is understandable through consideration of the probabilities of occurrence of an individual's genes in its close relatives. Thus altruism can be explained without recourse to `group selection'. However, on closer inspection, it would appear that many of the conclusions drawn from kin selection are based on a confusion between the units of selection| between the genes and the individuals. This confusion is often mirrored in the application of biological paradigms to computer systems, with the consequence that, if cooperation is required within a system, then it has to be engineered in. A proper understanding of the biological explanations of altruism can be used to design computer systems in which cooperation is a natural consequence of the system, rather than an additional, overcomplicated burden.

Reference-contexts: There has already been some good work on producing cooperation, notably the two rounds of tournaments organised by Axelrod <ref> [2] </ref>. In order to determine good strategies for the problem known as the `Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma', Axel-rod held competitive tournaments in which the various strategies entered were played against each other. Although not strictly altruistic, the tournament environment was such that the overall winner in both rounds was `friendly'.

Reference-contexts: The difference between Darwin and the neo-Darwinists is that Darwin thought of reproduction as a blending of parental information, as opposed to the modern, particulate theory of genetic recombination <ref> [3, p. 47] </ref>. But the real difference is that Darwin thought that natural selection selected the fittest individuals, and the neo-Darwinists believe that it is the gene that is the true unit of selection.

This is because evolution works on genes, not on individuals. Dawkins gives an example of a gene which causes beards to become green and that also encourages altruism <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Kin selection is a theory, first suggested by W. D. Hamilton, that attempts to explain the apparently anomalous, altruistic behaviour of certain individuals, without recourse to group selectionism <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.1 Altruism and Kin Selection In order to explain the principles behind kin selection it is useful to talk of genes as though they consciously choose between a number of alternatives, and to think of them as promoting or inhibiting various phenotypic phenomena. <p> The advent of the `modern synthesis' (as neo-Darwinism is often called) brought a new definition of fitness, em-phasising the importance of the gene as the unit of selection. This is what is referred to by the term, inclusive fitness. Hamilton <ref> [8] </ref> realised that classical fitness is too limited in scope; it is a measure of the reproductive success of a single individual. But an individual is merely a vehicle for the real 3 replicators|the genes. The reproductive suc-cess of an individual is irrelevant, since it is ephemeral.

Reference-contexts: Finally, an outline of a cooperating 1 system environment, based on kin selection is suggested. 2 A Biological Explanation Evolution is seen, by neo-Darwinists, as a process controlled by three factors: mutation, natural selection and migration <ref> [15, p. 180] </ref>. Within a given environment a population of replicators generates novelty through mutation, develops adaptation with natural selection, and produces new, distinct populations through migration (called allopatric specia-tion).

Reference-contexts: In time, it was seen that the link between fitness and survival was so useful that fitness was redefined to mean, `the factor which predisposes an individual to be likely to survive'. This definition of fitness rendered Herbert Spencer's <ref> [17] </ref> phrase, `survival of the fittest', tautologous. The advent of the `modern synthesis' (as neo-Darwinism is often called) brought a new definition of fitness, em-phasising the importance of the gene as the unit of selection. This is what is referred to by the term, inclusive fitness.

Reference-contexts: All three of these examples have been explained by recourse to the `good of the species' (for an intelligent example of this type of explanation, see <ref> [18] </ref>), but group selection (as it is known) is itself something that seems opposed to a view of genes as `selfish' replicators, with no ability to see into the future.
