Abstract: Given the prominence of the lexicon in most current linguistic theories (LFG, HPSG, GB), the inventory of language particular information left in the lexicon deserves special attention. Constructing large computerized lexicons remains a difficult problem, building a large array of apparently arbitrary information. This paper shows that this arbitrariness can be constrained more than might have been previously thought. In particular, arbitrariness of argument structure, word sense, and paraphrasability will be shown not only to be constrained, but also to be integrally related. Our (radical) view is that variation of lexical behavior across languages is exactly like lexical variation within languages, specifically, the difference lies in the presence or absence of certain morphemes. For example, the fact that Japanese has richer possibilities in certain verbal patterns is derived solely from its All of these languages have exactly the same alternation type. Why? Let us focus on the role of figure and ground 3 in these examples. By alternation, we mean that in each language the figure, as expressed as a direct object in the (a) cases, alternates with the figure as expressed in an equivalent PP in the (b) cases. Despite the differences in word order and case marking, all share the property that the direct object is subject to a socalled Holistic Effect: 4 Crucially, the (a) sentences differ from the (b) sentences in exactly the same way in each of these languages. In (1b), where John loads the wagon with hay, the wagon is understood to have a whole load 3 By ground, we mean the surface background involved in the action represented by the verb. By figure, we mean the object that is brought into contact with the ground. For example, in (1), the hay is the figure which is brought into contact with the wagon, in this case, the ground. See Talmy 1978 and Emonds 1991 for of hay, likewise if John smears the wall with paint, the

Reference-contexts: Many researchers, including Makino 1991 and others, have noticed the drawbacks of encoding thematic roles, but in the absence of a clear alternative, still require them for representing lexical information. Furthermore, it is common knowledge that verbs pattern into certain equivalence classes within languages <ref> (e.g., Levin 1993) </ref>, but arbitrary verb classes would imply arbitrary variation across languages.
