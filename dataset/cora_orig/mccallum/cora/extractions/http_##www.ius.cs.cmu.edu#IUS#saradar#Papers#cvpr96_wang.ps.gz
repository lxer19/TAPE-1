Title: Determining Correspondences and Rigid Motion of 3-D Point Sets with Missing Data

Abstract: This paper addresses the general 3-D rigid motion problem, where the point correspondences and the motion parameters between two sets of 3-D points are to be recovered. The existence of missing points in the two sets is the most difficult problem. We first show a mathematical symmetry in the solutions of rotation parameters and point correspondences. A closed-form solution based on the correlation matrix eigenstructure decomposition is proposed for correspondence recovery with no missing points. Using a heuristic measure of point pair affinity derived from the eigenstructure, a weighted bipartite matching algorithm is developed to determine the correspondences in general cases where missing points occur. The use of the affinity heuristic also leads to a fast outlier removal algorithm, which can be run iteratively to refine the correspondence recovery. Simulation results and experiments on real images are shown in both ideal and general cases.

Reference-contexts: Previous motion research has been divided roughly into two approaches, depending on whether or not the correspondences are recovered. Some researchers (e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>) try to recover the point correspondences using combinatorial searches. These methods are very time-consuming. The other research trend is the estimation of motion parameters without knowing correspondences [1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9].

Reference-contexts: The depths of these model points from the camera vary from 13 feet to 33 feet in the sequence. The other data source is triangulated data, which are acquired by a triangulation procedure using corresponding 2-D image data <ref> [3] </ref>, and represented in a local camera coordinate system. As seen in Figure 5 (Middle), some model points were not captured in the image sequence due to the limited view of the camera. Only 26 points were successfully triangulated.

Reference-contexts: A matching algorithm will find a maximum weighted matching such that the feature vectors have the most affinity to each other between Q A and Q B . An efficient weighted bipartite matching algorithm with expected time complexity O (mn log (min (m; n))) has been proposed by Karp <ref> [6] </ref>, provided that the weights of the edges from any fixed node in V A are identically distributed random variables. We adopt this algorithm to solve for the correspondences of the feature vectors.

Reference-contexts: The multiplications by eigenvalues make the eigenvectors that correspond to bigger eigenvalues have more influence on h ij . Some authors <ref> [10] </ref> use similar affinity definitions in solving correspondence problems. But motion issues and outlier removal issues are not their main focus. 3.2 Weighted Bipartite Matching Weighted bipartite matching is a mathematical tool which can be used to solve motion correspondence problems with affinity.

Reference-contexts: Given a matrix Z and its column re-ordered version Z P , there may exist many permutation matrices, among which there always exists one in strict form. (A strict form of permutation matrices is an identity matrix with its rows re-ordered <ref> [11] </ref>.) With this property and equation (2), the following claim holds: in the ideal motion problem, there always exists an m fi m permutation matrix P such that B C = RA C P ; (3) particularly, there is such a P in strict form. <p> The matrices D, U A and U B can be calculated from standard eigenstructure decomposition procedures. (Equation (5) holds only if the signs of the eigenvectors in U A and U B are consistent.)

Reference-contexts: So far we have solved the ideal 3-D correspondence problem in a closed form, and have reduced the original problem to estimation of rotation and translation from 3-D points with known correspondences. Sev--eral noise-resistant solutions to this problem have been published (e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>). One of the advantages of our method over correspondenceless methods is that it can make use of these noise-resistant algorithms directly, while correspondenceless methods cannot. 3 General Correspondence Recovey A shortcoming of the closed-form solution is that it is limited to ideal motion problems. <p> Compute the affinity h ij 's using formula (7). 4.
