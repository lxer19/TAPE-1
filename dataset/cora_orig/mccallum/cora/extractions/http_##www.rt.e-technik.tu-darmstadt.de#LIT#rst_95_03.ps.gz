The article at hand presents new results and conceptions concerning the intelligent and autonomous control of biotechnological processes by integrating conventional, knowledge-based and learning methods. The extended system BioX ++ facilitates the transparent generation of process control strategies and sequences based on automatically self-organized structured process models. Experimental results showing the increased product yield and the discussion of approach-specific problems are part of this paper as well as the new approaches actually examined. Key Words.

Reference-contexts: Based on the data of 17 process runs with constant setpoints of underlying conventional temperature and pH controllers predictive process models were learned using AMS - explained in detail in (Tolle and Ers u, 1992) as an effective software implementation of an interpolating storage device of the CMAC type <ref> (Albus, 1975) </ref>. The whole process was divided into two physiological states, the first state describes the lag and main growth phases (ca. 0 - 10 hours processing time), the second state all following growth phases and the main amylase production (ca. 10 - 50 h).

Reference-contexts: Thus the extended system BioX ++ was developed in order make a higher autonomy of the process management system accessible to the user. 3. THE EXTENDED SYSTEM BioX ++ shown in fig. 4 and first described in <ref> (Bettenhausen and Tolle, 1993) </ref> does not distinguish in its implementation explicitely between a knowledge-based and a learning layer but it performs related tasks. This can be achieved by a Fig. 4. <p> This process can be called learning of rules and is transparent for the operator because of the linguistic man-machine interface. It was first examined concerning the rule based classification of characteristic process phases of the ff-amylase fermentation. These results were part of the oral presentation related to <ref> (Bettenhausen and Tolle, 1993) </ref> and published in German (Bettenhausen et al., 1993). <p> It was first examined concerning the rule based classification of characteristic process phases of the ff-amylase fermentation.

This mechanism of rule learning was also applied to a multivariable continuous working stirred tank reactor a benchmark problem for the design of nonlinear controllers (Klatt and Engell, 1992) generating high-level signal range controller outputs superpositioned to a classical diagonal PID controller.

Reference-contexts: the underlying conventional control loops is implemented in the object oriented programming language C ++ still on a SUN Workstation . * Second, a fuzzy approach for rule representation instead of an interpolating memory extensively uses the similarities between nonlinear mappings generated by neural or fuzzy conceptions, see for example <ref> (Brown and Harris, 1994) </ref>. This fuzzy approach is based on a pre-defined complete rule space and allows the automatic correction and extension of rulebases. This process can be called learning of rules and is transparent for the operator because of the linguistic man-machine interface.

Reference-contexts: The concept of such a control system called BioX using a flexible integration of expert system techniques and learning control based on neural networks as well as first results in fermentation control using this system were presented in <ref> (Gehlen et al., 1992) </ref>. New results using BioX for optimization of a fermentation process and a demonstration of the achievable improvements will be reported in the first part of this paper. <p> A short summary and a preview of future practical and theoretical work will be given in the last section. 2.

Reference-contexts: For each model a fitness value is evaluated by assessing its accuracy and complexity. By imitating the principles of natural selection and reproduction <ref> (Holland, 1975) </ref> a process of evolutionary improvement of the models structure is achieved. This finally leads to models that combine high accuracy and low complexity, which are needed for most kinds of control purposes.

Reference-contexts: The conception called Fuzzy-Lernas is explained in detail in (Betten-hausen, 1994). Genetic algorithms and the search algorithm of Hooke and Jeeves <ref> (Hooke and Jeeves, 1961) </ref> were used in order to optimize the rulebase, applied to continuous processes and supporting transitions between several working or equilibrium points. This behaviour can also be achieved by a pure neural approch (Suykens et al., 1994). <p> Starting with some elementary transfer elements like time-delay or Monod kinetics placed in a so called "model construction set" a number of models are more or less randomly created. Using well known optimization methodes - e.g. the algorithm of Hooke and Jeeves <ref> (Hooke and Jeeves, 1961) </ref> - the parameters of the models are adapted to measured process response. For each model a fitness value is evaluated by assessing its accuracy and complexity.
