Abstract: In this paper, we study cost-effective approaches to paral-lelize rule generation algorithms. In particular, we consider the propositional rule generation algorithm of the Discovery Board system, and present our design and implementation of a parallel algorithm for the same task. We then present some early performance results of our parallelization scheme on hardware and software distributed shared memory multiprocessors.

Reference-contexts: The algorithms for this problem must explore all combinations of attribute-values (of all lengths), with several such sets of attribute combinations being mutually independent. The problem thus lends itself naturally to parallelization, and can greatly benefit from it. Much of the early work done in this area <ref> [1, 2, 9, 4] </ref> has dealt with one particular type of problem: market basket analysis. This problem deals with generation of association rules when the data consists of boolean valued attributes present within a transaction.

Reference-contexts: However, this approach further multiplies the number of attributes, increasing the problem size substantially. The the DISCOVERY BOARD system <ref> [5] </ref> generates such generalized association rules directly from relational data, which can be persistently stored and later filtered using rule-queries. We attempt to parallelize this algorithm, and present our observations and results in this paper. The goal of our research is cost-effective parallelization of data mining algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Hardware-coherent shared memory systems usually provide very good performance but are expensive. Given the growing need for data mining and the increasing number of huge data sets, a more cost-effective solution is called for. As an alternative to hardware shared memory platforms, software distributed shared memory systems <ref> [7] </ref> represent an inexpensive solution to provide the shared address space abstraction on any network of computers. Recent results also indicate that the performance of software distributed shared memory systems improved substantially by using efficient protocols [10], low-latency communication architecture [3], and adequate parallel application structuring [6]. <p> We chose a 16-node SGI Challenge which is a bus-based, symmetric shared memory multiprocessor with centralized memory. Processor's speed is 150 MHz and the total size of the main memory is 1 Gbyte. The primary goal of our research is to demonstrate that the software shared memory approach <ref> [7] </ref> can be a cost-effective parallel platform for data mining. We chose a home-based lazy-release consistency protocol (HLRC) [10] which was shown to provide good performance and scalability. For our experiments we plan to implement a multi-threaded HLRC on an 8-node SMP cluster based on Myrinet interconnect.

Reference-contexts: Each node has two 300 MHz Pentium II processors with a 128 MBytes of memory which brings the total main memory available on the cluster to 1 Gbyte. The data mining programs are written in C using the the Argonne National Laboratories parmacs <ref> [8] </ref> macros for parallel constructs. Since both parallel platforms support this API programming we expect to our programs to be portable between these two environments. 5.2 Current Status At this point, we are able to test a parallel version of our algorithm on hardware shared memory platform only.
