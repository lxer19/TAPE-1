Title: Abstract*  
Keyword: quality of service, resource management, distributed operating systems  
Abstract: Complex distributed systems require resource management capabilities that can allocate resources to applications, monitor and control the use of resources, and reallocate resources in response to anomalies. To utilize resources efficiently and meet application and system-wide requirements, the resource management system must consider resource availability, control policies, and applications quality-of-service (QoS) requirements when making allocation decisions. We identify several open research areas in QoS-based system resource management and briey describe the ongoing Glo- bal Resource Management (GRM) project, which will address some of these areas.

A benefit function specifies the benefit to the user or to the system as a whole of attaining a given QoS level.
