Abstract: We describe an integrated problem solving architecture named INBANCA in which Bayesian networks and case-based reasoning (CBR) work cooperatively on multiagent planning tasks. This includes two-team dynamic tasks, and this paper concentrates on simulated soccer as an example. Bayesian networks are used to characterize action selection whereas a case-based approach is used to determine how to implement actions. This paper has two contributions. First, we survey integrations of case-based and Bayesian approaches from the perspective of a popular CBR task decomposition framework, thus explaining what types of integrations have been attempted. This allows us to explain the unique aspects of our proposed integration. Second, we demonstrate how Bayesian nets can be used to provide environmental context, and thus feature selection information, for the case-based reasoner.

Reference-contexts: Such knowledge can be used to guide this process at any point in the cycle. This framework can be further decomposed, as is shown partially in Figure 3 <ref> (Aamodt & Plaza, 1994) </ref>. We will use this framework in the next section to distinguish previous work on integrating Bayesian and case-based reasoners. 3 Related work This section discusses some other research at the intersection of Bayesian and case-based reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Our approach will hierarchically organize case libraries under multiple perspectives so as to provide multiple methods for accessing a case. A simple approach for determining which cases are 18 relevant given a requested perspective <ref> (e.g., Acker & Porter, 1994) </ref> is to group cases according to perspective-relevant features.

Reference-contexts: When new feature are introduced, they will be available for use in both action networks and cases. Construction of new features can be implemented by using feature composition methods, such as the method described in <ref> (Aha, 1991) </ref>. 4. Memory organization: As learning proceeds, the number of cases and action networks will increase. Since an agent cannot observe all sensory information, situations can only be described from a single perspective (e.g., corresponding to the available sensor variables).

Reference-contexts: Rather, the burden is shifted from requiring users to formulate their knowledge as rigid abstractions to providing knowledge for indexing, relating, and adapting cases. Some scheme is needed to incorporate such knowledge. While many approaches have been used, only a few researchers have considered using Bayesian approaches <ref> (Heckerman, 1995) </ref> for this purpose. Yet Bayesian reasoning has a sound theoretical foundation for incorporating and updating knowledge structured as Bayesian networks. Thus, our primary objective in this paper is to demonstrate how Bayesian reasoning can profitably be applied to the needs of case-based reasoning. <p> Many researchers are actively addressing this problem. One possible solution is to replace a large network with a set of smaller ones, which is the approach we take in Section 4. Another active research topic is that of learning the structure of Bayesian networks <ref> (Heckerman, 1995) </ref>. While many approaches have been suggested and are applicable for our task, in Section 4 we describe a somewhat novel method for obtaining inputs for the learning algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This research will involve the following three phases: 1. Augment the RoboCup software to extend the agent's capabilities (e.g., the set of available primitive sensors) as needed. 2. Build CBR components (e.g., a memory structure, a feature construction component) and a Bayesian network interface. If BaRT <ref> (Hota et al., 1991) </ref> cannot be used, it will be necessary to implement some of BaRT's functions from scratch. 3. Evaluate the integrated approach by conducting soccer team competitions. Some of the primary challenges of this research plan are as follows. 1.

Reference-contexts: One network is available for each possible action. An agent evaluates each network with respect to the current state, and selects the action with highest probability. This model could be augmented by considering cost factors (i.e., as in an influence diagram <ref> (Howard & Matheson, 1981) </ref>), though we ignore such details in this paper. We briefly describe the contents, evaluation method and learning component for our Bayesian action networks. 2 Kushmerick et al. (1994) also addressed uncertain actions in a probabilistic planning system.

Reference-contexts: Reinforcement learning is becoming a popular technique for investigating robotic soccer behaviors (e.g., Ford et al., 1995; Asada et al., 1994). Most importantly, the RoboCup initiative <ref> (Kitano et al., 1995) </ref>, which serves as the basis for a IJCAI-97 robot competition and a future special issue in Applied Artificial Intelligence, is serving to inspire research on this topic.

Reference-contexts: Our emphasis is on plan reuse, where plans are stored with cases, rather than on planning from first principles (e.g., <ref> (Kushmerick et al., 1994) </ref>). Desired states (e.g., an open position near the goal) can be achieved via a particular type of action. Learning (i.e., network updating). An agent's action networks are updated when (1) new experience is acquired and when (2) the set of relevant abstract features is revised.

Reference-contexts: Most importantly, the RoboCup initiative (Kitano et al., 1995), which serves as the basis for a IJCAI-97 robot competition and a future special issue in Applied Artificial Intelligence, is serving to inspire research on this topic. Since the RoboCup simulator <ref> (Noda, 1995) </ref> provides a rich programming environment (e.g., physical models and action rules), it is likely, when polished, to serve as a testbed for comparing performances in simulated competitions. <p> Our approach uses Bayesian networks to select actions and case-based reasoning to implement selected actions. We will use the RoboCup soccer simulator <ref> (Noda, 1995) </ref> as a testbed for our approach. Our next step is to implement this integrated problem solver in this platform, and to test its competence in lesion and other comparison studies. This research will involve the following three phases: 1.

Reference-contexts: One of the primary limitations of Bayesian networks is their computational complexity, which is exponential in the number of nodes (Cooper, 1990). Also, the complete specification of a probability distribution can require the values of a large number of variables (e.g., <ref> (Pearl, 1988) </ref>). Many researchers are actively addressing this problem. One possible solution is to replace a large network with a set of smaller ones, which is the approach we take in Section 4. Another active research topic is that of learning the structure of Bayesian networks (Heckerman, 1995).
