Abstract: The Internet has grown into a large heterogeneous internetwork consisting of many separately-administered domains and carrying traffic of diverse applications. As a result, interdomain traffic is now subject to various administrative policy constraints and type-of-service (ToS) constraints. Traditional interdomain routing protocols are no longer adequate because the scaling techniques that they employ lose domain-level ToS and policy information, and hence may eliminate valid routes or allow invalid routes. My first protocol introduces a new hierarchy. Special routers called viewservers maintain the view of domains in a surrounding precinct. A viewserver can provide routes between source and destination nodes in its precinct. Obtaining a route between nodes that are not in any single view, involves accumulating the views of a sequence of viewservers. To make this process efficient, viewservers are organized hierarchically, and an associated addressing structure is used. My second protocol is based on aggregating domains hierarchically into superdomains. Traditional protocols using this approach lose domain-level ToS and policy information. I solve this problem by having routers store both a strong set of constraints and a weak set of constraints for each visible superdomain. The strong set (weak set) of constraints of a superdomain is constructed such that if it is satisfied (not satisfied) by a packet, then every route (no route) through the su-perdomain is valid for the packet. This information suffices for a query protocol to discover valid paths or the absence of such paths.

Reference-contexts: The cost equals 1 if all links from A to B are down. Each cost value of a domain-level edge hA; Bi can be derived from the cost values of the intra-domain routes in A and links from A to B <ref> [1] </ref>. Link cost changes and link/node failures and repairs correspond to cost changes, failures and repairs of domain-level edges. Link/node failures can also partition a domain into cells [21]. A cell is a maximal subset of nodes of a domain that can reach each other without leaving the domain. <p> The cost of a virtual-edge hU :g; hi is an aggregation of the cost of physical links in U and is calculated as follows: If U is a domain, the cost of hU :g; hi is calculated as the maximum/minimum/average cost of the routes within U from g to h <ref> [1] </ref>. For higher level superdomains U , the cost of hU :g; hi is derived from the costs of edges between the gateways of children super-domains of U .

Reference-contexts: An internetwork is organized into domains 2 . A domain is a set of networks (possibly consisting of only one network) administered by the same agency. Domains are typically subject to policy constraints, which are administrative restrictions on the inter-domain traffic <ref> [6, 17, 8, 2] </ref>. <p> This protocol must have the following properties: (1) It must satisfy the policy constraints of domains. To do this, it must keep track of the policy constraints of domains <ref> [2] </ref>. (2) An inter-domain routing protocol must also satisfy ToS constraints of applications. To do this, it must keep track of the ToS services offered by domains [2]. (3) An inter-domain routing protocol must scale up to very large internetworks, i.e. with a very large number of domains. <p> To do this, it must keep track of the policy constraints of domains <ref> [2] </ref>.

(3) An inter-domain routing protocol must scale up to very large internetworks, i.e. with a very large number of domains. Practically this means that processing, memory and communication requirements should be much less than linear in the number of domains. <p> A straight-forward approach to inter-domain routing is domain-level source routing with link-state approach <ref> [6, 2] </ref>. In this approach, each router 3 maintains a domain-level view of the inter-network, i.e., a graph with a vertex for every domain and an edge between every two neighbor domains. Policy and ToS information is attached to the vertices and the edges of the view.

Reference-contexts: The Superdomain Approach To achieve scaling, several approaches based on hierarchically aggregating domains into superdo-mains have been proposed <ref> [27, 24, 3] </ref>. Here, each domain is a level 1 superdomain, "close" level 1 superdomains are grouped into level 2 superdomains, "close" level 2 superdomains are grouped into level 3 superdomains, and so on (see Figure 1.3). <p> In Chapter 8, we conclude and present future research directions. 6 Chapter 2 Related Work In this chapter, we survey recently proposed inter-domain routing protocols that support ToS and policy constraints for large internetworks. 2.1 Superdomain Hierarchy with Link-State Approach Nimrod <ref> [3] </ref> and IDPR [27] use the link-state approach with domain-level source routing to enforce policy and ToS constraints and superdomains to solve scaling problem. Nimrod is still in a design stage. Both protocols suffer from loss of policy and ToS information as mentioned in the introduction. <p> One drawback of our protocols is that to obtain a source route, views are merged at or prior to the connection setup, thereby increasing the setup time. This drawback is not unique to our 51 scheme <ref> [6, 27, 3, 9] </ref>. There are several ways to reduce this setup overhead. First, source routes to frequently used destinations can be cached. Second, the views of frequently queried viewservers and the internal views of frequently queried superdomains can be replicated at "mirror" routers close to the source domain. <p> In fact, these protocols have not been evaluated in a way that we can compare them to our protocols. To the best of our knowledge, this dissertation is the first to evaluate hierarchical inter-domain routing protocols against explicitly stated policy constraints. Only two protocols, Nimrod <ref> [3] </ref> and Unified [9], are functionally close to our protocols and both are still in a design stage. We intend to investigate the application of our protocols in other environments. One such environment is ATM networking.

Reference-contexts: This scheme does not scale up. In fact, it increases the storage requirement, since a router maintains a route for each destination address, and there are more addresses with this scheme. Route fragments <ref> [5] </ref> is an addressing scheme where precomputed partial source routes are used as addresses. A destination route fragment, called a route suffix, is a sequence of domain ids from a backbone to the destination domain. <p> Here, the message is sent using the intra-domain routing protocols of the domains in dlsr to reach v. We assume that as long as there 3 This is similiar to matching route fragments <ref> [5] </ref>. However, in our case the sequence is computed in a distributed fashion (this is needed to handle topology changes). 12 is a sequence of up links connecting the domains in dlsr, the message is delivered to v 4 .

Reference-contexts: Both protocols suffer from loss of policy and ToS information as mentioned in the introduction. A query protocol for Nimrod is being developed to obtain more detailed policy, ToS and topology information. 2.2 Superdomain Hierarchy with Path-Vector Approach Several inter-domain routing protocols (e.g. BGP [18], IDRP [24], NR <ref> [9] </ref>) are based on a path-vector approach [26]. Here, for each destination domain a router maintains a set of paths, one through each of its neighbor routers. ToS and policy information is attached to these paths. Each router requires O (N D fi N D fi E R ) space. <p> In the landmark hierarchy, nodes within the radius of a landmark maintain a route to the landmark, but the landmark may not have a route to these nodes. In the viewserver hierarchy, a viewserver maintains (in its view) routes to the nodes in its precinct. 2.4 Other Approaches Reference <ref> [9] </ref> combines the benefits of path-vector approach and link-state approach by having two modes: An NR mode, which is an extension of IDRP and is used for the most common ToS and policy constraints; and a SDR mode, which is like IDPR and is used for less frequent ToS and policy <p> One drawback of our protocols is that to obtain a source route, views are merged at or prior to the connection setup, thereby increasing the setup time.

Every domain is placed in some level-2 superdomain, as follows.

It exchanges all paths between neighbor routers subject to the following constraint: a router does not inform a neighbor router of a route if usage of the route by the neighbor would violate some superdomain's constraint on the route.

Reference-contexts: The Superdomain Approach To achieve scaling, several approaches based on hierarchically aggregating domains into superdo-mains have been proposed <ref> [27, 24, 3] </ref>. Here, each domain is a level 1 superdomain, "close" level 1 superdomains are grouped into level 2 superdomains, "close" level 2 superdomains are grouped into level 3 superdomains, and so on (see Figure 1.3). <p> If there are domains with different (possibly contradictory) constraints in a superdomain, then there is no good way of deriving the ToS and policy constraints of the superdomain. The usual techniques <ref> [27] </ref> of obtaining ToS and policy constraints of a superdomain are to obtain either a strong set of constraints or a weak set of constraints 5 from the ToS and policy constraints of the children superdomains in it. <p> Both techniques have problems. Strong constraints can eliminate valid paths, and weak constraints can allow invalid paths. For example in Figure 1.3, d16 allows transit traffic 5 "strong" and "weak" are referred to respectively as "union" and "intersection" in <ref> [27] </ref> 4 from d1 while d19 does not; with strong constraints G would not allow transit traffic from d1, and with weak constraints G would allow transit traffic from d1 to be routed via d19. <p> Other problems of the superdomain approach are that the varying visibilities of routers complicates superdomain-level source routing and handling of node/link failures (especially those that partition superdomains). The usual technique for solving these problems is to augment superdomain-level views with gateways <ref> [27] </ref> (see Chapter 4). 1.1 Contributions In this dissertation, we present two inter-domain routing protocols. Each of these protocols scales well to large internetworks and finds a valid path if and only if one exists. <p> In Chapter 8, we conclude and present future research directions. 6 Chapter 2 Related Work In this chapter, we survey recently proposed inter-domain routing protocols that support ToS and policy constraints for large internetworks. 2.1 Superdomain Hierarchy with Link-State Approach Nimrod [3] and IDPR <ref> [27] </ref> use the link-state approach with domain-level source routing to enforce policy and ToS constraints and superdomains to solve scaling problem. Nimrod is still in a design stage. Both protocols suffer from loss of policy and ToS information as mentioned in the introduction. <p> For each destination, a router exchanges its best valid path with its neighbor routers. However, a path-vector algorithm may not find a valid path from a source to the destination even if such a route exists <ref> [27] </ref>. For example, suppose a router u has two paths P 1 and P 2 to the destination. Let u have a router neighbor v, which is in another domain. u chooses and informs v of one of the paths, say P 1. <p> This set is referred to as the flood area 7 . The topology of a flood area must be a connected graph. Due to the nature of flooding, a viewserver can receive information out of order for a domain 6 Our cells are like the domain components of IDPR <ref> [27] </ref>. 7 For efficiency, the flood area can be implemented by a hop-count and some forwarding limits (e.g. do not flood beyond backbones). 15 cell. In order to avoid old information replacing new information, each reporting gateway includes successively increasing time stamps in the messages it sends. <p> One drawback of our protocols is that to obtain a source route, views are merged at or prior to the connection setup, thereby increasing the setup time. This drawback is not unique to our 51 scheme <ref> [6, 27, 3, 9] </ref>. There are several ways to reduce this setup overhead. First, source routes to frequently used destinations can be cached. Second, the views of frequently queried viewservers and the internal views of frequently queried superdomains can be replicated at "mirror" routers close to the source domain. <p> This is because precise definitions of the hierarchies in these protocols are not available. For example, to do a fair evaluation of IDPR <ref> [27] </ref>, we need precise guidelines for how to group domains into superdomains, and how to choose between the strong and weak methods when defining policy/ToS constraints of superdomains. In fact, these protocols have not been evaluated in a way that we can compare them to our protocols.

Reference <ref> [32] </ref> suggests the use of multiple addresses for each node, one for each ToS and Policy. This scheme does not scale up. In fact, it increases the storage requirement, since a router maintains a route for each destination address, and there are more addresses with this scheme.
