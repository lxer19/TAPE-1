Abstract: Part of the results presented in this paper have already appeared in [5]) Abstract We investigate the complexity of the Configuration REachability Problem (CREP) for two classes of finite weakly predictable cellular automata: the invertible and the additive ones. In both cases we prove that CREP belongs tp the "Arthur-Merlin" class CoAM[2].

Reference-contexts: CREP is, in general, P SP ACE-complete (see for example [12]), thus, cellular automata are considered, in general, unpredictable. However, CREP's computational complexity may vary greatly depending 1 on the local interactions considered in input (see <ref> [8, 12] </ref>). A cellular automaton is called weakly predictable if F t (X) is polynomial-time computable (i.e. in time O [(log t)jXj k ], where k is a positive constant) and predictable if CREP is decidable in polynomial-time.
