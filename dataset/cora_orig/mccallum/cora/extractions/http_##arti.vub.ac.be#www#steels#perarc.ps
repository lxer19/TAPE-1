Abstract: A behavior system consists of the components and control programs necessary to establish a particular behavior in a robotic agent. The paper proposes a mathematical approach for the analysis of behavior systems. The approach rests on viewing a behavior system as a dynamical system whose equilibrium state is attained when the behavior it is responsible for is achieved.
