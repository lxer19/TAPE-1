Abstract: This paper reviews issues relating to one such defense proper selection, construction, and maintenance of an Internet Firewall a network node connected between a site and its' network peers, providing a configurable gateway through which all site-related network traffic must pass, in either direction.

Reference-contexts: Firewall selection should be dictated by functional requirements and the amount of control desired. For those who are chiefly interested in examining the issues relating to design, or who would like to examine the schematics of some real-world firewalls, several excellent technical papers and books exist [Ran93] <ref> [CB94] </ref> but, to the intrepid administrator who prefers to choose a firewall "off the shelf", most of the issues are easily resolved by application of decisiveness, and a little common sense.

Reference-contexts: permitted source and destination hosts (or networks), but it is also vitally important to note that the firewall's checking must be done against both ends of a connection, and must take into account the service port numbers at each end of the connection, otherwise the firewall may be trivially subverted <ref> [Cha92] </ref>. Connectionless protocols 2 like UDP cause so many headaches in this area that it is not uncommon for packet filtering firewalls to drop all UDP traffic, regardless of destination.

Reference-contexts: Configure your system so that any activities related to security leave some sort of audit trail behind preferably stored on immutable media, but if this is not possible, then at least try to check that your logfiles only ever grow bigger, not smaller. * Install auditing software such as "Tripwire' <ref> [KS93] </ref> or its smaller cousin "L5" which takes a snapshot of your filestore, and then can be run regularly to spot unexpected changes to your filestore.

Reference-contexts: A more complex example would be that of an FTP proxy client the proxy service must catch the FTP client's PORT commands <ref> [PR85] </ref> which contain the client's IP address and port number, etc, create an equivalent TCP port on it's own host, and pass the description of the latter onwards to the FTP server.

Reference-contexts: Reusable passwords are the ones most familiar to us, but the reliance that we still place upon them today is astonishing, given their epically insecure nature. Stories of their insecurity abound, from childrens stories ("Open Sesame!") to more modern versions of the tale <ref> [Sto89] </ref>. Password security is doubly irrelevant in this modern age of non-interactive, promiscuous network services FINGER, SMTP, POP, FTP, NFS, and so on which have little or no concept of authentication, or which trust a users' transactions on the basis that another machine has apparently authenticated him.
