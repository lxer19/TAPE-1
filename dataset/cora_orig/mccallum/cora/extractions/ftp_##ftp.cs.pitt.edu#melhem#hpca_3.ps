Abstract: In this paper, we study distributed path reservation protocols for multiplexed all-optical interconnection networks. In such networks, a path for a connection is reserved such that transmitted data remains in the optical domain until it reaches its destination. The path reservation protocols negotiate the reservation and establishment of connections that arrive dynamically to the network. They can be applied to both wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM), which are two techniques that allow the large optical bandwidth to be shared among multiple connections. Two classes of protocols are discussed: forward reservation protocols and backward reservation protocols. Simulations of multiplexed 2-dimensional torus interconnection networks are used to evaluate and compare the performance of the protocols, and to study the impact of system parameters on both network throughput and communication delay. The simulation results show that the backward reservation schemes provide better performance than their forward reservation counterparts.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With the increasing computation power of parallel computers, interprocessor communication has become an important factor that limits the performance of supercomputing systems. Due to their capabilities of offering large bandwidth, optical interconnection networks, whose advantages have been well demonstrated on wide and local area networks (WAN and LAN) <ref> [1, 6] </ref>, are promising networks for future supercomputers. Directly-connected networks, such as meshes, tori, rings and hypercubes, are commonly used in commercial supercomputers. By exploiting space diversity and traffic locality, they offer larger aggregate throughput and better scalability than shared media networks such as buses and stars. <p> While deflection routing requires simple network nodes and minimal buffering, a mechanism is necessary to guarantee bounded transfer delays within the network. As pointed out in <ref> [1] </ref>, although direct optical networks have intrinsically high aggregate throughput, this advantage comes at the expense of additional control complexity in the form of routing and congestion control. New solutions should exploit the inherent flexibility of dynamic reconfiguration of logical topologies.

Reference-contexts: By exploiting space diversity and traffic locality, they offer larger aggregate throughput and better scalability than shared media networks such as buses and stars. Optical direct networks can use either multi-hop packet routing (e.g.Shu*e Net <ref> [2] </ref>), or deflection routing [4]. The performance of packet routing is limited by the speed of electronics since buffering and address decoding usually requires electronic-to-optics and optics-to-electronic conversions at intermediate nodes.

Reference-contexts: For example, Figure 2 shows the two states that the 3 fi 3 switch attached to processor 2 must realize for the establishment of the connections shown in Figure 1. Note that each switch can be an electro-optical switch (Ti:LiNbO 3 switch, for example <ref> [8] </ref>) which connects optical inputs to optical outputs without optical/electronic conversion. The duration of a time slot is typically equal to the duration of several hundred bits.
