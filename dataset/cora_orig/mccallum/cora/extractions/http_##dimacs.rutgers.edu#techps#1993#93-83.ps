Abstract: An upper bound is given on the minimum distance between i subsets of the same size of a regular graph in terms of the i-th largest eigenvalue in absolute value. This yields a bound on the diameter in terms of the i-th largest eigenvalue, for any integer i. Our bounds are shown to be asymptotically tight. A recent result by Quenell relating the diameter, the second eigenvalue, and the girth of a regular graph is obtained as a byproduct.

Reference-contexts: Since our graphs have asymptotically optimal second eigenvalue, this shows that the bound 2 log k1 n is the best one can obtain using the second eigenvalue method. Note that the diameter of a random k-regular graph on n vertices <ref> [5, p. 238] </ref> is almost surely (1 + o (1)) log k1 n. We also prove that our bounds on the diameter in terms of ffi i are asymptotically tight, for any fixed i.
