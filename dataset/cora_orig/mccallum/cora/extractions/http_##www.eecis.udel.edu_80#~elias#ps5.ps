Title: ABSTRACT  
Abstract: Our VLSI neuromorphs, possess extensive dendritic trees with hundreds of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic sites. Useful signal processing can be achieved by evolving the appropriate connections to the synapses using genetic algorithms. In order to reduce the very large solution space, schemes for specifying connections have been borrowed from neural development. Results show the evolution of connections to a single neuromorph for the discrimination of temporal and spatio-temporal patterns.

Reference-contexts: It is this enormous range of connection possibilities that this work seeks to address by borrowing some principles of neural development in order to restrict the solution space, while achieving useful signal processing. Each neuromorph is a VLSI circuit comprising a spatially extensive artificial dendritic tree <ref> [1] </ref> and a spike generating soma. Figure 1a is a simplified circuit diagram of a short, five-compartment section of silicon dendrite. <p> When the voltage across the capacitor, C, exceeds a programmable threshold voltage, V th , the comparator generates a spike that discharges C and is captured in a register which is sampled by routing circuitry (virtual wires, <ref> [1] </ref>). We now address the problem of making input connections to a single neuromorph of this design to perform elementary temporal and spatio-temporal discriminations. <p> An initial population of 200-400 chromosomes were generated randomly and decoded into, V th , and the synaptic connections that were then written into the connection list memory of the virtual wire system <ref> [1] </ref>. The host computer delivered input spike patterns to the neuromorph in real time. Each chromosome was evaluated on the basis of the neuromorphs output spike train according to a fitness function. <p> This is evidently a difficult discrimination, given only hyperpolarizing and depolarizing synaptic effects. We expect much more robust discrimination when the GA is allowed (a) to select variable delays in synaptic activation, an important feature of our virtual wire system <ref> [1] </ref>, and (b) to exploit the non-linearities introduced by shunting inhibition. In directional discrimination, the clear superiority of shunting synapses over hyperpolarizing is a vindication of prior theoretical work [2,5].

Reference-contexts: When this voltage is set near the membrane resting voltage these transistors behave like shunting or silent inhibitory synapses <ref> [2] </ref>. The synapse transistors are turned on by an impulse signal applied to their gate terminals. Although synapse transistors are on for only 50 nsec, the resulting impulse response measured at the input to the soma (point S in Figure 1b) may last thousands of milliseconds.

Reference-contexts: The peak amplitude of the response is largest for synaptic activation nearest the soma and diminishes rapidly for sites farther away, while the latency to peak increases with distance from the soma. Thus, as in passive dendrites of biological neurons <ref> [3] </ref>, location on the dendrite determines the weighting of a synapse in its effects on amplitude and timing of the voltage response at the soma (see Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: Because the neuromorph has a fixed number of synaptic sites, each with fixed properties, either excitatory or inhibitory, the problem becomes one of where to connect input signals to the dendritic tree <ref> [4] </ref>. Figure 2 shows impulse responses generated at the soma, illustrating the non-linear effect of shifting an excitatory synapse along a dendritic branch, and the linear effect of increasing the number of activated synapses at a given level on the dendritic tree.

Reference-contexts: In structures such as olfactory bulb, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, the various classes of afferent fiber terminate preferentially at specific levels on the dendritic trees of neurons. Common too, particularly in cortical structures, are topographic, columnar patterns of innervation, where information is distributed vertically within the thickness of the cortex <ref> [6] </ref>. Thus, basing connections on the developmental principles that form similar patterns in the brain makes sense because guiding afferents into position is just as important for neuromorphs as it is for real neurons.
