Any attempt to use the model, whose documentation existed in three separate reports until this document was produced, would have been hampered by the lack of a single, consistent reference. <ref> [6, page 5] </ref> In addition, they mention that some minor changes have been made to the model. <p> It is merely required that, when an entity's active (respectively, passive) role is being considered, that entity be constrained by the model's treatment of subjects (respectively, objects). <ref> [6, page 9] </ref> They then go on to define "access attributes," which are the way that subjects can access objects. Since their viewpoint is distinctly military, they are concerned with "observing" and "altering" of objects. <p> They describe what they consider the four types of access that are "imaginable:" * no observation and no alteration; * observation, but no alteration; * alteration, but no observation; and * both observation and alteration. <ref> [6, page 10] </ref> They include specific access attributes for each of these four types of access in BLP. <p> Rules are defined as "a general construct . . . for the modular specification of system capabilities" <ref> [6, page 20] </ref>. Rules are functions that return an output ("decision") and a new system state for every input ("request") to the function. 3. Rule properties are related to system properties. They show that the entire set of rules satisfies all of the above three properties of W .

The alternatives to the standard Distributed Compartment Model varied from interesting failures to some that showed great promise.

Reference-contexts: More generally, the model should contain a definition of security that regulates how a system manages, protects, and distributes sensitive information as well as rules of operation that show how the definition of security is to be enforced. <ref> [31, page 133] </ref> This is a concise summation of the form of BLP. The influence of BLP on the Distributed Compartment Model should be obvious to the reader. According to Bell and LaPadula, their model has three major parts: 1. a descriptive capability; 2. general mechanisms; 3. specific solutions.
