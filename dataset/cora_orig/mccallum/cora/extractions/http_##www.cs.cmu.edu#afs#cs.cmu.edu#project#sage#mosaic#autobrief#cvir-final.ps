Abstract: This paper describes a media-independent knowledge representation scheme, or content language, for describing the content of communicative goals and actions. The language is used within an intelligent system for automatically generating integrated text and information graphics presentations about complex, quantitative information. The language is designed to satisfy four requirements: to represent information about complex quantitative relations and aggregate properties; compositionality; to represent certain pragmatic distinctions needed for satisfying communicative goals; and to be usable as input by the media-specific generators in our system.

Reference-contexts: A media allocation component decides which parts of the plan shall be realized by each generator. The text generator transforms its assigned parts to sentence specifications, for realization by a general-purpose sentence generator (SURGE) <ref> [Elhadad and Robin1996] </ref>. The graphics generator transforms its assigned parts of the plan to a sequence of user tasks which a graphic must support in order to satisfy the presentation goals.

Reference-contexts: These systems represent content about complex sequences of actions the user can perform on the physical device and their effects, as well as spatial con cepts. However, this work is not relevant to information graphics generation. The multimedia system whose focus is closest to ours, PostGraphe <ref> [Fasciano and Lapalme1996] </ref>, is a system that generates multimedia statistical reports consisting of graphics and text. However, there are some fundamental differences with our approach.
