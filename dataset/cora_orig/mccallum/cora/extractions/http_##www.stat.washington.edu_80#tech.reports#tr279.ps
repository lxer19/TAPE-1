Abstract: The key quantity needed for Bayesian hypothesis testing and model selection is the marginal likelihood for a model, also known as the integrated likelihood, or the marginal probability of the data. In this paper we describe a way to use posterior simulation output to estimate marginal likelihoods. We describe the basic Laplace-Metropolis estimator for models without random effects. For models with random effects the compound Laplace-Metropolis estimator is introduced. This estimator is applied to data from the World Fertility Survey and shown to give accurate results. Batching of simulation output is used to assess the uncertainty involved in using the compound Laplace-Metropolis estimator. The method allows us to test for the effects of independent variables in a random effects model, and also to test for the presence of the random effects.

Reference-contexts: The mean of the 15 within batch estimates is 220:5 and their standard deviation is 0:7. It can be argued <ref> (see Lewis 1994) </ref> that the compound Laplace-Metropolis estimator will have an approximate t-distribution with (B 1) degrees of freedom. Using this approximation, a 95% highest posterior density interval for the compound Laplace-Metropolis estimate would be (222:0; 219:0).

Reference-contexts: In other cases the requisite integrals have been approximated using such methods as Gaussian quadrature <ref> (Naylor and Smith 1982) </ref>, the Laplace approximation (de Bruijn 1970; Tierney and Kadane 1986) or Monte Carlo methods. With the availability of increasing computer power, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has become a reasonable alternative.

Reference-contexts: The marginal likelihood for the model without random effects can be approximated using the Laplace method <ref> (Raftery 1993) </ref>. For the 4 fixed effects model this was 222:15. Hence the Bayes factor for comparing the model with random effects against the model without random effects is exp f220:5 (222:15)g 1:35. There is some evidence, but only weak evidence, favoring the model incorporating random effects.
