Abstract: The potential equation provides a natural mathematical basis for all the illumination computation methods based on the strategy of shooting light. The particle tracing technique which physically simulates the particle model of light, can also be considered as a general, random walk based solution to the potential equation. As the complexity of the environment increases, the straight forward particle tracing method becomes inefficient. In this paper we discuss different biasing methods that could be used to increase the efficiency of the particle tracing process. In particular we present an importance driven scheme in which we use an approximate potential value as the biasing function for directing a majority of the random walks through regions of importance in the environment, thus efficiently estimating the light flux in these regions. A straight forward simple implementation of this scheme has been carried out and the results that we have obtained show that the scheme is very promising.

Reference-contexts: Based on the strategy used, all the existing methods can be classified into two broad categories, namely gathering methods and shooting methods. The radiance equation, better known as rendering equation <ref> [1] </ref>, provides the mathematical basis for the gathering methods and an adjoint equation termed as the potential equation provides the mathematical basis for the shooting methods. Though the shooting strategy methods are highly intuitive their mathematical basis, the potential equation, has only been recently introduced [2].

Reference-contexts: Though the shooting strategy methods are highly intuitive their mathematical basis, the potential equation, has only been recently introduced <ref> [2] </ref>. In this paper we shall briefly derive the potential equation and present the particle tracing technique, a general solution method by Monte Carlo and random walk. <p> Similarly in the computation of view independent global illumination of a diffuse environment by radiosity based methods one is computing flux from a small surface patch in the hemispherical direction. 1 The potential equation for complex environments with participating volume is derived in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 We can derive the expression for the actual flux received by the detector by using the potential function and the actual emission behaviour of the environment. <p> = A x = E fi A x = E fi n i=1 g k (x i 0 ; fi x i 0 ) + k=1 # = E fi n i=1 k=0 This method of evaluating k by first sampling the source function is the essence of particle tracing <ref> [2] </ref>. Particle tracing resembles the physical illumination process. <p> In practice the walk is terminated when the product term in the above equations falls below some minimum threshold. However this termination process introduces a bias into the estimation. An unbiased termination technique like Russian Roulette may be used to overcome this <ref> [9, 2] </ref>. 7 5.2 Source Biasing In particle tracing, the emission function, S (x; fi x ), plays an important role as every random walk originates at the light source.

Reference-contexts: Its main advantage stems from the fact that it is easily extended to handle general environments. Particle tracing and its implementation has been described in detail earlier <ref> [6] </ref>. In Fig. 1 we reproduce some of the results of these implementations. In the rest of the section we will concentrate only on this method. The solution of multidimensional integrations are best carried out by Monte Carlo quadrature technique [7, 8].
