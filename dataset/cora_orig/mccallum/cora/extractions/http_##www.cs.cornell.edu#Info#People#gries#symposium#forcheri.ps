Reference-contexts: In particular, we recall semantics based on the category theory [2, 21]: these semantics seem especially powerful for formalisms representing computational processes (for example lamba calcu lus <ref> [27, 3, 1, 17] </ref>). Furthermore, logical calculi for deduction, alternative to the classical ones, are proposed [15, 13].

Reference-contexts: introduction of paraconsistent logics [9]. These logics aim at formally including, even if locally, contradictions. Moreover, they are applied to quantum physics by means of quantum paraconsistent logics <ref> [8, 12] </ref>. * The importance of logics that formalize uncertainty (i.e. probabilistic, possibilistic, fuzzy logic) is increasing, from both a general and an effective point of view [19, 11, 13]. These logics allow a logical treatment of uncertainity, totally absent from logic of the past phase.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the past phase regarded reasoning with uncertainity as an informal concept. * The stimulus of artificial intelligence induces formal logic to tackle fragments of knowledge till now considered as non admitting formalization <ref> [26] </ref>. Formal ontologies for representing knowledge is a new idea that realizes a compromise between mathematical logic and philosophy topics which are traditionally disjoint from it. * The number of formal semantics, in alternative or opposition against classical semantics, is increasing.
