Title: Approximating Dense Cases of Covering Problems  
Author: Marek Karpinski and Alexander Zelikovsky 
Abstract: We study dense instances of several covering problems. An instance of the set cover problem with m sets is dense if there is * &gt; 0 such that any element of the ground set X belongs to at least * m sets. We show that the dense set cover problem can be approximated with the performance ratio c log jXj for any c &gt; 0 though it is unlikely to be NP-hard. A polynomial-time approximation scheme is constructed for the dense Steiner tree problem in n-vertex graphs, i.e. for the case when each terminal is adjacent to at least * n vertices. We also study the vertex cover problem in dense graphs, i.e. graphs with the bounded minimum or average vertex degree. A better approximation algorithm is suggested. Its performance ratio is 2 1+* and 2 p 1* for graphs with *jV j-bounded minimum and average vertex degree, respectively. We also consider superdense (complementary to sparse) cases of all these problems.

Reference-contexts: We construct a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the dense Steiner tree problem.

Similarly to the set cover problem, we define a ffi-superdense Steiner tree problem to be the case of Steiner tree problem where any terminal has at least jV j o (jV j ffi ) neighbors outside S. The ffi-superdense Steiner tree problem also can be solved efficiently. <p> Note that for * &gt; 1 2 , *-dense Steiner tree problem is a sub-case of the network Steiner tree problem with distances 1 and 2 which is still MAX SNP-hard <ref> [BP89] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This lemma implies that for a sufficiently small number of terminals, e.g. jSj 1 * , we can find an exact solution in polynomial time. Now we will show how we reduce the size of the given terminal set using a variation of Rayward-Smith heuristic (or the greedy algorithm <ref> [Z93] </ref>). Consider the subgraph G (S) of the graph G induced by the set of terminals S. If the graph G (S) is connected, then any spanning tree of G (S) is an optimal Steiner tree since it has jSj 1 edges.
