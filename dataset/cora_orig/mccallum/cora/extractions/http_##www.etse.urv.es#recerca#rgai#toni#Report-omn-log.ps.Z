Abstract: Beliefs have been formally modelled in the last decades using doxastic logics. The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically omniscient (they believe every classical tautology) and perfect reasoners (their beliefs are closed under classical deductive closure). Thus, this model would not be appropriate to model non-ideal agents, that have resource limitations that prevent them from attaining such levels of doxastic competence. This report contains a statement of these problems and a brief survey of some of the most interesting approaches that have been suggested to overcome them.

Reference-contexts: standard logical consequences but the consequences in relevance logic ([AnBe75]). 2.2.2 Explicit and implicit beliefs One of the most well known approaches to logical omniscience and perfect reasoning is the logic of explicit and implicit beliefs of Levesque ([Leve84]), which is described in this section with the notation used in <ref> [FaHa85] </ref>. Levesque uses a language with two modal operators: B for explicit beliefs and L for implicit beliefs. These operators are not allowed to be nested in the formulas of the language. <p> E.g. B (P ^ :P ) ^ :BQ is satisfiable. 11 * The agent may believe a formula ' and not believe a logically equivalent formula . E.g. B (P ^ :P ) ^ :B (Q ^ :Q) is satisfiable. In <ref> [FaHa85] </ref> it is pointed out that all these properties derive from the existence of incoherent situations. The following formula is valid: B' ^ B (' ) ) ) B ( _ (' ^ :')). <p> regardless of the knowledge of P, knows some propositional tautologies such as P P. * This logic only deals with one agent 9 , propositional logic 10 and does not allow nested beliefs 11 , so it is quite limited. 2.2.3 Logic of general awareness Fagin and Halpern suggest in <ref> [FaHa85] </ref> different logics that try to solve the problems of this last approach (however, they keep explicit and implicit beliefs). <p> Vardi suggests two ways of attacking this problem: * Add non-classical worlds to belief worlds. * Accept that epistemic notions are noy purely intensional, trying to add some syntactic flavour into the semantic part, as in <ref> [FaHa85] </ref>. 16 2.2.7 A unifying semantics Wansing shows in [Wans90] how different logics of knowledge and belief may be seen as particular cases of a semantics defined in a general possible worlds framework. This semantics is defined as follows. Let L be the language of multi-modal propositional logic. <p> different names in [Cres72], [Hint75], [Leve84] or [ReBr79]). * The separation between explicit and implicit beliefs, considered by Levesque in [Leve84]. * The addition of the concept of awareness in the logic of explicit and implicit beliefs, resulting in the logic of general awareness defined by Fagin and Halpern in <ref> [FaHa85] </ref>. * A semantic counterpart of Hintikka's syntactic approach, made by Rantala using urn models ([Rant75]). * Montague's intensional logic of beliefs ([Mont70]), that provides a semantic view of the idea of representing a belief set with a list of formulas. * The belief worlds defined in a constructive way by <p> Some of these classical approaches have been extended and improved in more recent proposals (e.g. [Lake87], [LaLe88], [Lake91a], [Lake94], [Delg95]). Other approaches ([FHV90], <ref> [FaHa85] </ref>, [FHMV95]) are based in similar ideas, as decoupling the evaluation of a primitive proposition from the evaluation of its negation.

Reference-contexts: Thus, this notion is similar to the necessity notion in normal modal logics, although Wooldridge stresses in [Wool95] that belief is not given a normal modal interpretation in his model. 2.1.4 Restrictions in deductions In <ref> [Hint86] </ref>, Hintikka suggests another syntactic solution to logical omniscience and perfect reasoning. <p> the models of the logic of general awareness are the intersection of a stable set with an arbitrary set (the awareness set). * It does not seem very realistic to model agents which are perfect reasoners with respect to a syntactic class of formulas. 2.2.4 Urn models Hintikka suggested in <ref> [Hint86] </ref> a syntactic approach to the problem of logical omniscience (see section 2.1.4).

Reference-contexts: If the axiom of positive introspection is added to system T , system KT 4 (also known as S4, see <ref> [HuCr68] </ref>) is obtained; in turn S4 can be transformed into S5 (KT 45) by adding the axiom of negative introspection. The system weak S5 (K45) contains the axioms of introspection but does not contain the axiom of knowledge. Adding the axiom of consistency to K45, the system KD45 is obtained.

Reference-contexts: Logical omniscience and perfect reasoning are also accepted in the classical puzzles of the literature of reasoning about knowledge, such as the muddy children, the wise men or the cheating wives ([FHMV95]). As Perlis points out in <ref> [Perl94] </ref>, omniscient formalisms have the major advantage of being simpler and easier to study, and can be taken as modelling ideal reasoners against which real (human or artificial) reasoners can be measured as approximations.

Reference-contexts: In that context there is an external view of knowledge, because it is the designer of the system who ascribes knowledge to the processes. Processes do not compute their knowledge, and they are not required to answer questions about it. As Shoham notes in <ref> [Shoh93] </ref>, in these applications the knowledge possessed by agents is so simple that complexity of internal reasoning can be neglected. <p> Some logics of rational action have also been proposed recently, but all of them seem to share the basic limitations of the possible worlds model in some way (see e.g. [CoLe90], [Shoh90], <ref> [Shoh93] </ref>, [RaGe91], [RaGe93], [RaGe95a], [RaGe95b]).

Reference-contexts: semantic counterpart of Hintikka's syntactic approach, made by Rantala using urn models ([Rant75]). * Montague's intensional logic of beliefs ([Mont70]), that provides a semantic view of the idea of representing a belief set with a list of formulas. * The belief worlds defined in a constructive way by Vardi in <ref> [Vard86] </ref>. * Wansing ([Wans90]) uses non-normal worlds and Rantala models to provide a logical framework that unifies most of the previous approaches. Some of these classical approaches have been extended and improved in more recent proposals (e.g. [Lake87], [LaLe88], [Lake91a], [Lake94], [Delg95]).

Reference-contexts: Vardi suggests two ways of attacking this problem: * Add non-classical worlds to belief worlds. * Accept that epistemic notions are noy purely intensional, trying to add some syntactic flavour into the semantic part, as in [FaHa85]. 16 2.2.7 A unifying semantics Wansing shows in <ref> [Wans90] </ref> how different logics of knowledge and belief may be seen as particular cases of a semantics defined in a general possible worlds framework. This semantics is defined as follows. Let L be the language of multi-modal propositional logic.

Reference-contexts: lemma that shows the relationship between the satisfactibility of sentences that contain the belief operator and derivations in the internal language of the agent: the set f [S i ], :[S i ]g is B (L, ) unsatisfiable iff 9ffi* s.t. ` (i) ffi. 2.1.3 Belief models Wooldridge describes in <ref> [Wool95] </ref> a way of modelling the belief systems of resourced-bounded reasoners. This model subsumes classical ways of belief modelling, such as Konolige's deduction model of belief ([Kono86a], see section 2.1.2) or the standard use of doxastic normal modal logics. <p> The agent may also believe a formula and its negation (if both of them are included in bel (&lt; ; BE &gt;)). These facts make it similar to Levesque's logic of implicit and explicit belief ([Leve84]), which will be described in section 2.2.2. As noted in <ref> [Wool95] </ref>, logical omniscience is avoided in this model because neither axiom K nor the necessitation rule of normal modal logics hold (because of the syntactic nature of belief models, and especially of belief extension relations). <p> Thus, this notion is similar to the necessity notion in normal modal logics, although Wooldridge stresses in <ref> [Wool95] </ref> that belief is not given a normal modal interpretation in his model. 2.1.4 Restrictions in deductions In [Hint86], Hintikka suggests another syntactic solution to logical omniscience and perfect reasoning. <p> approaches: * A simple syntactic idea: to represent a belief set with a set of formulas. * The deduction model of belief suggested by Konolige in [Kono86a], in which the set of beliefs of an agent is represented by an axiomatic system. * The belief models described by Wooldridge in <ref> [Wool95] </ref>, that generalise Konolige's axiomatic systems. * A syntactic solution (based in the number of free symbols and the number of nested quantifiers contained in a formula) suggested by Hintikka in [Hint86]. * A more philosophical approach: to consider impossible worls (labelled with different names in [Cres72], [Hint75], [Leve84] or [ReBr79]).
