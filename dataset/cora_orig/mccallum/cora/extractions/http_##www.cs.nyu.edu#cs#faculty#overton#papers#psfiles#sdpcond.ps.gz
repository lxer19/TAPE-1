Title: Conditioning of Semidefinite Programs  
Author: Madhu V. Nayakkankuppam Michael L. Overton 
Keyword: Semidefinite programming, perturbation theory, Kantorovic theory, condition number.  
Abstract: This paper studies the conditioning of semidefinite programs by analyzing the effect of small perturbations in problem data on the solution. Under the assumptions of strict complementarity and nondegeneracy, an explicit bound on the change in the solution is derived in a primal-dual framework, using tools from the Kantorovic theory. This approach also quantifies the size of permissible perturbations. We include a discussion of these results for block diagonal semidefinite programs, of which linear programming is a special case.

Since we assume that strict complementarity holds, we give the nondegeneracy definitions under this assumption, simplifying the definitions slightly. <p> We add the following third assumption. * Assumption 3: The primal (1) and the dual (2) programs have solutions X 0 and (y 0 ; Z 0 ) satisfying strict complementarity, primal nondegeneracy and dual nondegeneracy. 2 These assumptions guarantee that the primal and the dual solutions are unique <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> The proof of (ii) in the theorem is an immediate consequence of Corollary 2.1: since e J (~u 0 ) is nonsingular, the perturbed problem [ e A; ~ b; e C] also satisfies strict complementarity and nondegeneracy [4], which in turn guarantees that the solution ~u 0 is unique <ref> [1] </ref>. The proof of (iii) is a consequence of the second conclusion of Theorem 2.1, combined with the nonsingularity of e J (~u 0 ). See [2] for more on Newton's method in this context. <p> The primal and the dual semidefinite programs can be formulated over this space of block diagonal matrices, just as in (1) and (2), but with S n replaced by B q . The nondegeneracy conditions of <ref> [1] </ref> can be extended in a straightforward way to B q via tangent and normal spaces to the cone of positive semidefinite matrices in B q (see Appendix B). As in Section 1, we provide an equivalent linear algebra characterization of nondegeneracy here, assuming that strict complementarity holds. <p> Conditioning of Semidefinite Programs 11 3.2 Linear Programming In the case q = <ref> [1; : : : ; 1] </ref> with g = n, the A k 's, C and X are n fi n diagonal matrices, and SDP over the space B q reduces to linear programming (LP). <p> Note that Assumption 3 is generically satisfied <ref> [1] </ref>.

Conditioning of Semidefinite Programs 6 Lemma 2.1 ([2, Theorem 1]) Let [A; b; C] define an SDP satisfying the Assumptions. Then, the Jacobian at the solution, J (u 0 ), is nonsingular. See <ref> [2] </ref> for a proof. Conversely, it is also true that if an SDP has a solution u 0 such that J (u 0 ) is nonsingular, then strict complementarity and nondegeneracy hold at u 0 [4].

See <ref> [2] </ref> for more on Newton's method in this context. The following corollary establishes a bound on the relative error in the solution of a perturbed SDP, and thus introduces the notion of a condition number for semidefinite programs.

Reference-contexts: we use the compact notation [A; b; C] to denote the SDP's in (1) and (2). 2 Perturbation Analysis for SDP The two classical, qualitative notions of stability for a general mathematical programming problem are stability with respect to the optimal value, and stability with respect to the solution set <ref> [6] </ref>. Our analysis quantifies the latter for an SDP satisfying the assumptions, by explicitly bounding the change in the solution for a sufficiently small perturbation in the problem data. Consider a perturbation of the problem parameters A k , b, and C in (1).
