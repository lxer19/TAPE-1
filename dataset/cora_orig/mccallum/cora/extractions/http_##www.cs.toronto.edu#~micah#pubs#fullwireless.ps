Abstract: An ad-hoc wireless network is a collection of wireless mobile hosts forming a temporary network without the aid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration. This type of network is of great importance in situations where it is very difficult to provide the necessary infrastructure, but it is a challenging task to enable fast and reliable communication within such a network. In this paper, we model and analyze the performance of so-called power-controlled ad-hoc wireless networks: networks where the mobile hosts are able to change their transmission power. We concentrate on finding schemes for routing arbitrary permutations in these networks. In general, it is NP-hard even to find a n 1* -approximation for any constant * to the fastest possible strategy for routing a given permutation problem on n mobile hosts. However, we here demonstrate that if we allow ourselves to consider slightly less general problems, efficient solutions can be found. We first demonstrate that there is a natural class of distributed schemes for handling node-to-node communication on top of which online route selection and scheduling strategies can be constructed such that the performance of this class of schemes can be exploited in a nearly optimal way for routing permutations in any static power-controlled ad-hoc network. We then demonstrate that if we restrict ourselves to the important case of routing between nodes distributed randomly in a Euclidean space, we can route in time that is asymptotically optimal for any routing scheme. y Email: chrsch@uni-paderborn.de.

Reference-contexts: Communication problems have been studied by many authors for both the case that a conflict can be detected and the case that it cannot be detected. Studies of multi-hop PRNs have mainly concentrated on broadcasting problems. Lower bounds on this problem are considered in <ref> [1, 26, 3, 20, 6] </ref>. A number of papers also deal with constructing efficient broadcast protocols [9, 40, 11, 3, 17, 35]. Let n denote the size, D denote the diameter, and denote the maximum degree of a given PRN. <p> Definition 2.2 Let the probabilistic communication graph (or PCG for short) G = (V; p) be defined as a complete directed graph with node set V and edge labels determined by the function p : V fi V ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Every edge e can forward a packet in one time step, but only succeeds in doing this with probability p (e). Next we define how to transform transmission graphs to PCGs.

Reference-contexts: On top of these protocols we develop schemes for the other two layers that almost optimally exploit the power of the MAC layer protocols for any transmission graph. For this we introduce a parameter R (G; S), similar to the routing number of <ref> [2, 29] </ref>, that represents a lower bound on the expected time required to route a random permutation in G using the MAC scheme S. <p> In order to have a measure for the quality of the dilation and congestion of a path collection, we use the so-called routing number. This number is defined as follows (see, e.g., <ref> [2, 29] </ref>): Consider an arbitrary PCG G = (V; p) with N nodes. Let S N represent the set of all permutations over [N ] = f0; : : :; N 1g.

Reference-contexts: This type of wireless network is known as an ad-hoc network [19, 21]. Ad-hoc wireless networks have been recognized as an important form of wireless network.

Ad-hoc networks can be divided into two categories: simple, where the mobile hosts use fixed transmission powers, and power-controlled, where the mobile hosts are able to change their transmission power.

Reference-contexts: On top of these protocols we develop schemes for the other two layers that almost optimally exploit the power of the MAC layer protocols for any transmission graph. For this we introduce a parameter R (G; S), similar to the routing number of <ref> [2, 29] </ref>, that represents a lower bound on the expected time required to route a random permutation in G using the MAC scheme S. <p> In order to have a measure for the quality of the dilation and congestion of a path collection, we use the so-called routing number. This number is defined as follows (see, e.g., <ref> [2, 29] </ref>): Consider an arbitrary PCG G = (V; p) with N nodes. Let S N represent the set of all permutations over [N ] = f0; : : :; N 1g. <p> Theorem 2.5 For any PCG G with routing number R and any routing strategy, the average, over all permutations, expected number of steps to route a permutation in G is bounded by (R). Proof. The proof follows directly from a proof in <ref> [29] </ref>. Hence asymptotically the routing number is not only an upper bound, but also a lower bound for the average permutation routing time using optimal routing strategies in G. This demonstrates that the routing number is a robust measure for the routing performance of graphs within our model.

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge, no results for an abstract model exist on how to select routes or schedule the transmissions of messages for power-controlled ad-hoc networks. However, connectivity problems have 2 been studied for both simple ad-hoc networks <ref> [30] </ref>, as well as power-controlled ad-hoc networks [38, 25]. Kirousis et al. [25] present a polynomial time algorithm for finding the minimum cost transmission power assignment that maintains connectivity for arbitrarily distributed collinear points, where the cost of an assignment is defined as total power usage.

Reference-contexts: We demonstrate how to take advantage of the considerable similarity between randomly distributed nodes in such a domain space and existing work on computing with faulty arrays <ref> [34, 24, 13] </ref>. <p> When region r ij contains more than 1 node, one arbitrarily chosen node in the region performs the communication performed by processor p ij of the array. Existing work on routing with faulty arrays considers the scenario where each node fails independently with probability p <ref> [34, 24, 13] </ref>. Thus, in order to simulate algorithms for the faulty array, we need to deal with the fact that the event that a given square contains some node is dependent on how many other squares also contain nodes.

Reference-contexts: Studies of multi-hop PRNs have mainly concentrated on broadcasting problems. Lower bounds on this problem are considered in [1, 26, 3, 20, 6]. A number of papers also deal with constructing efficient broadcast protocols <ref> [9, 40, 11, 3, 17, 35] </ref>. Let n denote the size, D denote the diameter, and denote the maximum degree of a given PRN. Bar-Yehuda et al. [3], for instance, present a randomized distributed broadcast protocol that completes in expected O (D log n + log 2 n) steps.

Reference-contexts: A transmission conflict can not be detected by the sending node. * All nodes work in a synchronized way. (For simplification reasons, this paradigm is commonly used in the design and analysis of wireless communication strategies that are robust to slight differences in the speeds at which the nodes operate <ref> [3, 18, 36] </ref>.) As noted above, the level of abstraction of this model is high.

Reference-contexts: On the Hardness of Routing in Ad-Hoc Networks Several authors have already presented NP-hardness results for various wireless communication problems, such as the problem of finding an optimal broadcast schedule [9] or scheduling transmissions in the case where every node wants to send a message to one of its neighbors <ref> [37] </ref>.

See, for instance, the model developed by Ulukus and Yates <ref> [38] </ref>. However, in practice it turns out that only signals with strength over some threshold value contribute to blocking a node, since all other signals tend to cancel each other out rather than add up, or may even be insignificant compared to the white Gaussian noise that is always present. <p> Furthermore, incorporating the SIR into our model in the manner proposed by <ref> [38] </ref> makes our proofs considerably more complicated, but has no qualitative effect on the results of Chapter 2 and only an insignificant qualitative effect on the results of Chapter 3.

Reference-contexts: The proof of the theorem can be found in the appendix. Hence, for L = O ( R log N ), the congestion and dilation of routing a randomly chosen function using paths in P is bounded by O (R), w.h.p. Using Valiant's trick <ref> [39] </ref> of routing packets first to randomly chosen intermediate destinations before they are routed to their original destinations, we can get this congestion bound for arbitrary permutations, w.h.p. 10 So if there were an o*ine protocol that can route packets along an arbitrary simple path collection with congestion C and dilation
