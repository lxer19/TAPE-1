Title: Internet Timekeeping Around the Globe 1,2  
Author: David L. Mills Ajit Thyagarjan and Brian C. Huffman 
Keyword: computer time, network time, time synchronization  
Affiliation: Electrical and Computer Engineering Department University of Delaware  
Abstract: This paper describes a massive survey of Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers and clients in order to discover statistics of time and frequency errors, as well as determine the health and welfare of the NTP synchronization subnet operating in the global Internet. Among the conclusions of the survey are that most NTP clocks are within 21 ms of their synchronization sources and all are within 29 ms on average. However, additional errors up to one-half the roundtrip delay are possible, but relatively rare. There is, however, a disturbing incidence of improperly operating servers and misguided server configurations.

Reference-contexts: In addition, an uncounted number of private servers and clients lurk behind the firewalls of many large government and corporate networks. There have been several previous studies <ref> [1] </ref>, [3], [4] which have compiled population and error statistics using timedissemination protocols such as the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and others.

As a result, clock offset errors cannot be distinguished from asymmetric network delays. There is evidence to suggest that errors due this cause are not uncommon; however, by design the errors due to asymmetric delays are bounded by half the roundtrip delay [2], although errors this large are rare. <p> As with other survey data analyzed, the tails on the distributions can be very long. From anecdotal evidence, the larger values due to the widely varying incidence of con gestion in the Internet of modern times. 5 From anecdotal evidence and previously reported results <ref> [1] </ref>, [3], the delay asymmetry is seldom more than one-tenth the roundtrip delay. For LANs with delays in the low milliseconds, the asymmetric errors are generally negligible. Even on long paths spanning the Atlantic where propagation delays dominate, the errors are small compared to those due to network jitter.

Reference-contexts: A comprehensive description of the NTP architecture, protocol and algorithms is beyond the scope of this paper, but can be found in <ref> [2] </ref> and citations found there. The NTP timekeeping network consists of a hierarchical tree of primary (stratum 1) time servers at the root. These provide synchronization to secondary servers at increasing stratum levels (hops) to the leaves of the tree. server. <p> As a result, clock offset errors cannot be distinguished from asymmetric network delays. There is evidence to suggest that errors due this cause are not uncommon; however, by design the errors due to asymmetric delays are bounded by half the roundtrip delay <ref> [2] </ref>, although errors this large are rare. Figure 6 shows the CDF for the delays measured between the 38,722 servers used in the time offset survey. The results show median delay 118 ms, mean 186 ms and maximum a whopping 1.9 s.
