Abstract: This paper reports about a project on document retrieval in an industrial setting. The objective is to provide a tool that helps finding documents related to a given query, such as answers in Frequently Asked Questions databases. A CBR approach has been used to develop a running prototypical system which is currently under practical evaluation.

Reference-contexts: For the work reported here, however, it is not clear how the required TBoxes and ABoxes can be obtained from the plain text documents. Probably, this requires a lot of manual effort and would result in a sophisticated structuring of documents similar to <ref> [1] </ref>. 7 Summary In this article, we have presented results from the FAllQ project which aimed at applying a CBR approach to the domain of document retrieval.

Reference-contexts: Structuring of IEs: For building the FAllQ system, manuals and other materials have been used to gain a basic understanding of the system. This knowledge has been translated into a flat structure, namely similarity of IEs. As has been shown in <ref> [5] </ref>, it is possible to utilize more structured knowledge for representing similarity in CRNs. This should be applied in the FAllQ system, too.

Reference-contexts: This might have been due to the limited size of the case base and needs further exploration. 6.2 Why not Information Retrieval? At first sight, the approach described in this paper may look very similar to traditional approaches from Information Retrieval (IR, <ref> [8] </ref>). What's more, LHS even tested some of the available IR tools before considering CBR. The major disadvantages of IR are: IRis mainly based on statistics over document sets, it will be hard to inte grate a user-specific similarity measure with a reasonable amount of effort.
