Abstract: Georgia Tech Technical Report: GIT-CC-95-45 IBM Research Report: RC 20249 Abstract In typical video delivery systems offering programs on-demand, service should be be nearly immediate and continuous. A video server can provide this type of service by reserving sufficient network and server resources for the duration of playout. Scalability and reduced cost can be achieved using a single channel to serve multiple customers waiting for the same program (referred to as batching). Batching is especially useful during high load periods typically occuring during evening prime time hours. Typical channel allocation algorithms use a greedy, allocate-as-needed policy. Variations in system load can cause these algorithms to suffer poor and unpredictable short-term performance, and non-optimal long term performance. In this paper, we develop a set of realistic workloads, identify the limitations of greedy allocation algorithms, and propose a set of rate-based allocation schemes to solve these limitations. The performance of various video delivery systems are simulated and compared. The rate-based policies are shown to be robust for the workloads examined, and are easy to implement.

Because resources in both the server and network are finite, there is a hard limit on the number of channels that can be simultaneously delivered [5, 6, 7, 8].

Customer behavior defines the request arrival pattern or workload at the server. Over a 24-hour simulation period the workload is expected to vary depending on the time of day <ref> [16, 6] </ref>. In Figure 3, we propose three new non-steady state workloads. The horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis shows the number of requests that arrive during a six minute reporting interval. <p> Empirical evidence presented in [17] suggests that = 0:271. The Zipf distribution roughly translates to an above average number of requests for popular or hot movies and less frequent requests for unpopular or cold movies. 3. Reneging Behavior: Various video delivery service models have been proposed <ref> [9, 10, 6] </ref> and simulated. The model we use in this study is based on customers unwillingness to wait for service more than some finite amount of time [19]. Because servicing is first come, first served, all requests will eventually be satisfied.

In accordance with FCFS, the request 3 in the front of the queue is served first and all other requests waiting for the same program are batched and serviced together.
