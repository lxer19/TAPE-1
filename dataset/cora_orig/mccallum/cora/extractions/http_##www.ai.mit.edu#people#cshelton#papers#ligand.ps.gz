Abstract: In recent years an effort has been made to supplement traditional methods for drug discovery by computer-assisted "structure-based design." The structure-based approach involves (among other issues) reasoning about the geometry of drug molecules (or ligands) and about the different spatial conformations that these molecules can attain. This is a preliminary report on a set of tools that we are devising to assist the chemist in the drug design process. We describe our work on the following three topics: (i) geometric data structures for representing and manipulating molecules; (ii) conformational analysis|searching for low-energy conformations; and (iii) pharmacophore identification|searching for common features among different ligands that exhibit similar activity.

Reference-contexts: It is known that if we restrict each molecule to one conformation, finding the largest such subset is NP-hard; from the point of approximate solutions, it is known to be hard to approximate <ref> [1] </ref> and only weak positive results are known [19]. There exist polynomial-time algorithms for the problem if we consider only two point sets [2], and these could be used to build algorithms over a larger number of point sets; however, these solutions are inefficient.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Most existing pharmaceutical drugs were found either by chance observation or by screening a large number of natural and synthetic substances <ref> [7] </ref>. In recent years there has been a growing tendency to supplement the traditional methods of drug discovery by structure-based design. The structure-based approach builds on the improved understanding of the molecular interaction underlying diseases, and attempts to predict the structure of a potentially active compound.

The implementation provides extensive facilities for interaction. It displays the molecule and the individual atom arrangements graphically, and also allows for re-coloring of the atoms according to several parameters such as the level of contribution to the outer surface.

Reference-contexts: A basic question in the geometric manipulation of molecules is the following: Given a hard sphere model of a molecule M and a query atom q, report the atoms of M intersected by q. It has been shown <ref> [16] </ref> that for a molecule with n atoms, an efficient data structure requiring O (n) storage space can be constructed such that queries of the above type can be answered in O (1) time each, after O (n) expected preprocessing time.

This data structure was used [16] to obtain efficient algorithms for constructing molecular surfaces and for computing the visibility map of molecules. In the next subsection we describe an implementation of the above algorithm for computing the molecular surface. <p> This is achieved by adjusting the individual atom arrangements so as to retain only the faces in those arrangements that contribute to the outer surface, and by updating the edge information of edges that now border faces belonging to two different atom spheres (see <ref> [16] </ref> for details). The arrangements on the spheres are used to compute the molecular surface area and the (possibly null) area contributed by each atom to the outer surface, as well as for graphic display of the intersection pattern of each atom with its neighbors (Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: The goal of conformational search, which is discussed in Section 3, is to produce low-energy conformations of ligand molecules. These conformations constitute the input to the pharmacophore identification procedure. Conformational search is compu-tationally expensive and may take hours on high speed workstations <ref> [21] </ref>. We aim for speed and efficiency of calculation, and are willing to find low-energy conformations that are not necessarily energy minima. <p> Another widely used approximation is to consider that the molecule is in vacuum. In this case, the energy of the molecule can be computed by empirical force-fields which consider only intramolecular quantities. The definition of such fields has been the result of intensive research <ref> [21] </ref>. Typically they have terms that involve pairs, triplets, and quadruples of bonded atoms, as well as pairs of distant non-bonded atoms. In reality, however, the conformation of a molecule is influenced both by intramolecular and intermolecular forces. Our techniques require as input a pro 6 Fig. 2. <p> Conformational analysis is a very hard search problem when the molecule under consideration has more than 5 degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: A major source of difficulty in structure-based drug design is the flexibility of molecules to attain various conformations, namely different spatial configurations of their atoms. Properly handling flexible ligands has been identified as a major challenge in this field <ref> [22] </ref>. We have chosen to concentrate on the following topics where algorithmic tools are needed to support the design process: (i) data structures for representing molecule geometry and molecular surfaces; (ii) conformational analysis | searching for low-energy conformations; and, (iii) pharmacophore identification. <p> solution for a given sequence of updates and queries, even when the molecule graph is a path, is an NP-hard problem and we present approximation algorithms for this case. 3 Conformational Search Searching the conformational space of small ligands is an important operation in the process of pharmaceutical drug design <ref> [22] </ref>. Given a function that computes the energy of the molecule, the goal of the search is to produce low-energy conformations that are geometrically distinct.

Reference-contexts: One type of molecular surface is simply the outer boundary of the union of the balls (or spheres) in the hard sphere model above. This type is often referred to as the van der Waals surface.

This approach is simple, but computationally expensive, and cannot handle situations where a pharmacophore may exist in most, but not all, molecules. It should also be noted that these methods do not address the case where molecules can be in one of many conformations.

The radius assigned to each atom depends on the type of the atom. There are various sets of recommended values for atom radii, and a prevailing set is known as the van der Waals radii. <p> This type is often referred to as the van der Waals surface.
