Abstract: We present a novel application of a neural network to augment manual precision by canceling involuntary motion. This method may be applied in microsurgery, using either a telerobotic approach or active compensation in a handheld instrument. A feedforward neural network is trained to input the measured trajectory of a handheld tool tip and output the intended trajectory. Use of the neural network decreases rms error in recordings from four subjects by an average of 43.9%.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Various error components are inherent in human hand motion. Involuntary hand motion hampers microsurgery, particularly in the ophthalmological field <ref> [1] </ref>. Suppression of involuntary movement would improve microsurgical practice and enable manipulation of smaller tissue sites [2]. The two approaches available for this application are teleoperation and active noise control. In the teleoperative scenario, the human operates a master interface. <p> If error can somehow be distinguished from intended motion, it can be removed from the drive signal sent to the slave. Telerobotic microsurgical systems currently under development include those of Hunter et al. [3] and Schenker et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. In the active noise control approach, actuation is built into the handheld surgical instrument to perform error compensation, as in the development work of Bose et al. [4] and the experimental investigations of Riviere et al. [5]. <p> Gonzalez et al. [9] proposed an equalizer to suppress pathological tremor. Riviere et al. [5] developed an adaptive filter to cancel physiological tremor during surgery, using an artificial frequency-modulated sinusoid as a reference. However, other significant sources of error, including jerk <ref> [1] </ref> and drift, or low-frequency error [10], have yet to be substantially suppressed. Since little is known about these components, and since reference signals, e.g., for adaptive noise canceling, are unavailable, suppression is difficult.

Reference-contexts: Long-term canceling of tremor based on one-time training of a neural network may therefore still be possible, as opposed to indefinite canceling of, say, a nonlinear deterministic process, which would clearly be infeasible due to the inevitable estimation error in training and the propensity for initially close trajectories to diverge <ref> [21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Improving this behavior of the trained network is an aim of ongoing research. Another option for error canceling is the development of a hybrid system combining of the neural network with the weighted-frequency Fourier linear combiner (WFLC) of Riviere and Thakor <ref> [22] </ref>. The WFLC is an adaptive filter designed for suppression of physiological tremor during microsurgery. It successfully cancels tremor, but by its nature does not account for lower-frequency components of error.
