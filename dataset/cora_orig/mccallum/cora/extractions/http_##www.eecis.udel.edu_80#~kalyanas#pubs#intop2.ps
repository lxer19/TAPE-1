Reference-contexts: Based on this definition, the scope of network management includes configuration, performance, fault, security and accounting management. These sub-areas have been specified as part of the OSI standards <ref> [1] </ref>. A Network Management Framework encompasses the various components needed for network management. The Network Management Framework (Figure 1) includes a Managing Entity or Manager, a Managed Entity or Agent, Managed Objects, Management Protocol and a Structure of Management Information.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2 shows the OSI and Internet Network Management models superimposed on the Network Management Framework. In the case of the Internet Management Model, the managing entity is the Network Management Station (NMS), the managed entity is the agent, the management protocol is Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) <ref> [2] </ref>, SMI is defined in [3] and the MIB is MIB-II [4]. The resources modeled as management objects are those maintained by TCP, IP, ICMP etc. The OSI model is an example of an object-oriented model.

Reference-contexts: The resources modeled as management objects are those maintained by TCP, IP, ICMP etc. The OSI model is an example of an object-oriented model. The managing entity is an OSI Manager, the managed entity is an OSI Agent, the management protocol is Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) <ref> [5] </ref>, the MIB is specified using Guidelines for the Definition of Management Objects (GDMO) [6]. 3 Issues in Interoperability The problems in interworking dissimilar management models can result from incompatibilities between any two corresponding components in the respective management models.

Reference: [7] <author> L. LaBarre. </author> <title> IIMC Draft 3: Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs. </title> <type> (Internet Draft). </type> <institution> DDN Network Information Center, SRI International, </institution> <month> May </month> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: There are two types of MIB translations: Direct Mapping: This type of translation maps each management object in one model into one or more management objects that represent the original management object, but 6 in a format consistent with a different management model <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. The effect of direct mapping is to project a management object in one model into an equivalent object (or objects) in another management model. This projection may involve syntactic and object type changes. <p> Name mapping, in this example, allows managed objects in the Internet model to be mapped onto names that conform to OSI managed object name format. Such a mapping allows an OSI manager to uniformly access both OSI and Internet objects. An example based on <ref> [7] </ref> for name mapping is shown in Figure 3. This example shows the udp group of MIB-II mapped to conform to the OSI method of addressing the udp objects. Name mapping in this case involves registration, class definitions and creation of name bindings (Figure 3 (a)). <p> The application gateway approach requires both name and instance mapping. An example of direct name and instance mapping between Internet MIB-II and OSI GDMO MIB can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. MIB translation includes the following: 17 * specification of registration schemes for managed objects in the MIB to be translated. * translation algorithm to map objects in the source MIB to objects in the destination MIB. * specification of instance identification schemes. <p> It is the authors' opinion that paradigm development based on a careful consideration of the relevant issues will lead to clean and efficient schemes. Currently, work is in progress towards achieving interoperability and coexistence of OSI and Internet management models <ref> [7, 9, 15] </ref>. Although some progress has been made, there is work to be done in automatic MIB translations, abstract MIB mappings and stateful application gateways.

Reference-contexts: There are two types of MIB translations: Direct Mapping: This type of translation maps each management object in one model into one or more management objects that represent the original management object, but 6 in a format consistent with a different management model <ref> [7, 8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The translation does not involve functional mapping of management services. For protocol translation to be complete each PDU in one protocol must be mapped onto one or more PDUs in the other protocol along with associated parameters and error codes. mapping of PDUs, the reader is referred to <ref> [9] </ref>. In many cases such complete translation may not be feasible. An example of such a case is the scoping function specified through a parameter (or field) of a CMIP PDU. In order to map the scoping function it is necessary to map the semantics of such a function. <p> Addition of a new model does not adversely affect existing proxies. A new model leads to addition of a new application gateway at the point where a network supporting the new model is connected to the existing network. A scheme using an application gateway approach <ref> [13, 9] </ref> is shown in Figure 12. In this scheme application gateways are points of interworking between the two dissimilar management models. In this approach, the manager supports a management protocol that is different from that supported by a managed node. An application gateway receives management requests from a manager. <p> Hence both protocol translation and service emulation may be necessary. For the application gateway approach to work, guidelines for both protocol translation and service emulation are normally specified in conjunction with a MIB translation scheme. The reader is referred to <ref> [9] </ref> for an example scheme that attempts to interwork OSI and Internet. Protocol translation is specified on a PDU basis with each parameter and error being mapped bidirectionally between the manager and agent models. <p> It is the authors' opinion that paradigm development based on a careful consideration of the relevant issues will lead to clean and efficient schemes. Currently, work is in progress towards achieving interoperability and coexistence of OSI and Internet management models <ref> [7, 9, 15] </ref>. Although some progress has been made, there is work to be done in automatic MIB translations, abstract MIB mappings and stateful application gateways.

Reference-contexts: In other words, transparency is the ability of a service provider to hide the underlying details so that the service user sees a common set of services in spite of different service providers. Some of the terminology presented here has been borrowed from Distributed Systems <ref> [10] </ref> and adapted to suit a network management environment. In the context of network management, transparency can be broadly classified as: * Application or Service Transparency. * MIB Transparency. 11 * Protocol Transparency. definition.

Reference-contexts: This approach is viable when existing large dissimilar networks need to be managed. In this approach, the management system features a common user 13 front-end which hides, to the extent possible, the details of the underlying networks, management protocols and services <ref> [11] </ref>. A common set of services are offered to the user. A user makes use of these services to manage the underlying network (s). A user interacts with the management system using the common set of services provided by the front-end.

Reference-contexts: The multiple stack scheme increases the complexity and size of the managers in a network. This disadvantage is offset by the fact that there are very few managers for any given network. Multiple Agent Approach: A Multiple agent scheme <ref> [12] </ref> is depicted in Figure 11. The figure shows only two agents but it can be extended to more than two agents. In this approach, each node has an instance of each type of agent that may be needed.

Reference-contexts: For instance, if an OSI manager is chosen then the management applications can make use of the Common Management Information 18 Services (CMIS) <ref> [14] </ref> to manage the network. If an Internet manager is chosen then the Internet services are available. Transparency Related Issues: The different types of transparencies have been outlined in Section 4. The following paragraphs discuss the transparencies achieved by the multiple stack, multiple agent and application gateway approaches.
