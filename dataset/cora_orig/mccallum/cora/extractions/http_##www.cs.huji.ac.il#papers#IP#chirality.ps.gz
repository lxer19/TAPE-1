Abstract: Many natural shapes are chiral (or handed). Our hands, for example, have a right-hand version and a left-hand version, the two types being mirror images of each other. Molecules are also classified according to their chirality, which determines their chemical characteristics. Glucose, for example, is sweet only in one chirality, while it is tasteless in the other. The notion of chirality for two dimensional binary shapes is studied, and scales for quantitative assessment of the degree of shape-chirality are developed. The chirality measures are based on boundary analysis, and perfom well on shapes with natural variations, scaling differences or digitization errors. The measures can also be used with partially occluded shapes, and provide indications on the change of chirality as resolution changes.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, such analysis could not distinguish between enantiomers. Another possible approach is to decompose the image into a sum of chiral basis functions, like the polar Fourier transform presented by Bigun and Granlund <ref> [1] </ref>. We have tried such an approach, and found it also to be sensitive to small and irrelevant variations. Furthermore, the conversion into polar coordinates of a grid-sampled image introduced additional inaccuracies. We have found a chirality measure based on rotational features of the body to be the most practical.

Reference-contexts: The first to observe the importance of chirality in chemistry were the French chemists Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and Jean Baptiste Biot (1774-1862) who determined the connection between the chirality of crystals and the deflection of the plane of polarization light passing through them <ref> [2] </ref>. The goal of our work is to examine a set of two dimensional shapes, and conclude whether the objects in the set are chiral. Once shapes are found to be chiral, we would like to classify them according to chirality class.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the set of all human hands can be divided into two classes, each having its own specific chirality. Not only body parts have right or left handedness. This property, chirality, exists almost everywhere. Chirality has special significance in the study of elementary particles <ref> [3] </ref> whose fl Y.H. was supported by the Leibniz Center for Research in Computer Science. y Dept. of Organic Chemistry. 1 chirality is due to their spin. Similarly, molecules can appear in two possible configura-tions, called D (dextro) chirality and L (levo) chirality [6], each having different chemical characteristics.

Although not stated explicitly, the concept of chirality is a static concept; a molecule is judged to be chiral or non-chiral based on its static shape. This static concept collapses if one substitutes the static picture with a dynamic one.

Reference-contexts: We have tried to quantify chirality using moment invariants <ref> [5] </ref> and the correlation between a shape and its mirror image, but have found such measures to be too sensitive to noise and to variations caused by digitization. Furthermore, such analysis could not distinguish between enantiomers.

Reference-contexts: This iterative search will stop when a point has higher chirality measure than all its neighbors. Simulated Annealing <ref> [7] </ref> can be used to prevent stopping at local maxima, but is not computationally efficient. A faster method to reach the center of chirality uses a multiresolution search. 4.1 Multiresolution Search Define a pyramid [8] as a sequence of reduced resolution images.
