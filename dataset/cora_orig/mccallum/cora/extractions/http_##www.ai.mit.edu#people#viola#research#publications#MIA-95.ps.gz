Abstract: A new information-theoretic approach is presented for finding the registration of volumetric medical images of differing modalities. Registration is achieved by adjustment of the relative position and orientation until the mutual information between the images is maximized. In our derivation of the registration procedure, few assumptions are made about the nature of the imaging process. As a result the algorithms are quite general and can foreseeably be used with a wide variety of imaging devices.

Reference-contexts: Smoothing was performed by convolving with the binomial kernel f1,4,6,4,1g, and subsequent reduction was accomplished by deleting alternating samples. This scheme generates an approximation to a "Gaussian Pyramid" representation of the data <ref> (Burt and Adel-son, 1983) </ref>. Rigid transformations were used, they were represented by displacement vectors and quaternions. At each iteration an incremental change in position and orientation was computed. The incremental rotation was represented by a small-angle approximation of a rotation quaternion that is linear in three parameters.

Reference-contexts: One reason this problem arises is because the MRI data is anatomical, while the PET data is functional. A variety of methods could be used to overcome this difficulty- one approach would be to first isolate the brain in the MRI, semi-automatic methods for doing this are available <ref> (Cline et al., 1990) </ref>. 4 Surgical Applications One of the primary motivations for this research has been the integration of information from differing medical images for surgical exploitation.

Reference-contexts: Several researchers have investigated the use of joint entropy to characterize the proper registration of medical imagery (Studholme, Hill and Hawkes, 1995b) (Col-lignon et al., 1995a), and found that it is not a robust measure of registration, with <ref> (Collignon et al., 1995a) </ref> describing difficulties associated with partial overlap of the data. (Collignon et al., 1995a) and (Studholme, Hill and Hawkes, 1995a) found registration based on mutual information to be an attractive approach, with (Collignon et al., 1995a) describing the use of Powell's optimization method. <p> researchers have investigated the use of joint entropy to characterize the proper registration of medical imagery (Studholme, Hill and Hawkes, 1995b) (Col-lignon et al., 1995a), and found that it is not a robust measure of registration, with <ref> (Collignon et al., 1995a) </ref> describing difficulties associated with partial overlap of the data.

Reference-contexts: While such approaches are often useful, the need for reliable segmentation can be a drawback for surface-based registration methods. In addition, the skin surface may be the least geometrically accurate part of MRI data, due to susceptibility artifacts.

Reference-contexts: P fl (z) is widely known as the Parzen Window density estimate. It is described in the textbook <ref> (Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>. 2 In our subsequent analysis we will assume that the window function is a Gaussian density function. This will simplify some of our subsequent analysis, but it is not necessary. Any differentiable function could be used. Another good choice is the Cauchy density. <p> It will be near zero if some v k is significantly closer to v i than v j . Distance is interpreted with respect to the squared Mahalanobis distance (see <ref> (Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>) D v (v) v T 1 v v : Thus, W v (v i ; v j ) is an indicator of the degree of match between its arguments, in a "soft" sense.

Reference-contexts: For smaller sample sizes, less effort is expended, but additional noise is introduced into the derivative estimates. Stochastic approximation is a scheme that uses noisy derivative estimates instead of the true derivative for optimizing a function (see (Widrow and Hoff, 1960), (Ljung and Soderstrom, 1983), and <ref> (Haykin, 1994) </ref>). Convergence can be proven for particular linear systems, provided that the derivative estimates are unbiased, and the learning rate is annealed (decreased over time).

Reference-contexts: The tumor was, however, evident with good contrast in a T2-weighted acquisition (see Figure 10).

Mutual information is defined in terms of entropy in the following way (see the textbook <ref> (Papoulis, 1991) </ref>, for example): I (u (x); v (T (x))) h () is the entropy of a random variable, and is defined as h (x) p (x) ln p (x)dx ; while the joint entropy of two random variables x and y is h (x; y) p (x; y) ln p

Stochastic approximation is a scheme that uses noisy derivative estimates instead of the true derivative for optimizing a function (see <ref> (Widrow and Hoff, 1960) </ref>, (Ljung and Soderstrom, 1983), and (Haykin, 1994)). Convergence can be proven for particular linear systems, provided that the derivative estimates are unbiased, and the learning rate is annealed (decreased over time).

Reference-contexts: It arises because of the additional influence of the term that rewards for complexity (en-tropy) in the portion of the test volume into which the reference volume is transformed. Woods <ref> (Woods, Mazziotta and Cherry, 1993) </ref> has suggested a measure of registration between MR and PET based on the assumption that when registered the range of PET values associated with a particular value of MR should be minimized.
