Reference-contexts: The most important step so far in our understanding of the complexity of propositional proofs was taken by Ajtai in a remarkable paper <ref> [1] </ref> in which he proved the following result. Theorem 7.2 For a given Frege system F, natural numbers c; d, and sufficiently large n, any depth c proof of P HP n in F must have size greater than n d .

Reference-contexts: It follows that A 1 ; : : : A t cannot be a proof of P HP n . Hence, any proof in F of P HP n must have size at least 2 n ffi . 2 In a subsequent paper <ref> [2] </ref>, Ajtai extended his lower bound to a system obtained from a bounded depth Frege system by adding certain axiom schemes.

Reference-contexts: These lemmas allow the proof of strong lower bounds on the size of bounded depth circuits computing functions such as parity. The reader is referred to papers of Razborov [51] and Beame <ref> [5] </ref> for elegant proofs of various switching lemmas. Theorem 7.3 Let F be a Frege system and d &gt; 4. Then for sufficiently large n every depth d proof in F of P HP n must have size at least 2 n ffi , for ffi &lt; (1=5) d .

Reference-contexts: Ajtai proved that whenever p; q are distinct primes, the propositional formulas Count qn+1 q do not have polynomial size, bounded depth Frege proofs &gt;from instances of Count m p , where m 6 0 (mod p). Beame, Impagliazzo, Krajcek, Pitassi and Pudlak <ref> [6] </ref> extended this result to composite p and q. The preceding results are significant not just from the point of view of propositional complexity theory, but also as providing independence results in systems of bounded arithmetic.

Reference-contexts: Ajtai's proof is a highly ingenious blend of non-standard models for number theory and combinatorics. Subsequent work by a number of authors simplified Ajtai's proof, first eliminating the use of non-standard models [9], second improving the lower bound from super-polynomial to exponential <ref> [39, 7, 49, 38] </ref>. Krajcek [39] proved the first truly exponential lower bounds for bounded depth proofs, using modified versions of the pigeon-hole formulas for each depth d. In the same paper, he also showed that depth d Frege systems cannot p-simulate depth d + 1 Frege systems. <p> In the same paper, he also showed that depth d Frege systems cannot p-simulate depth d + 1 Frege systems. Shortly afterwards, Pitassi, Beame and Impagli-azzo <ref> [7, 49] </ref> and (independently) Krajcek, Pudlak and Woods [7, 38] improved Ajtai's lower bound for the pigeon-hole principle &gt;from super-polynomial to exponential; their proof is sketched here.

Let D; R be fixed, where jDj = n +1, jRj = n. The set of matchings between D and R we shall denote by M n .

Reference-contexts: Beame and Pitassi <ref> [8] </ref> recently extended Ajtai's result by showing an exponential lower bound on the size of bounded depth Frege proofs of P AR n in Frege systems with the added pigeonhole schemes (Stren Riis [53] gave an independent proof of this result).

Reference-contexts: This theorem serves to separate bounded-depth Frege systems &gt;from Frege systems in the map of proof systems, since Buss <ref> [11] </ref> shows that the pigeonhole tautologies have polynomial-size proofs in a Frege system (this result improves on the earlier result of Cook and Reckhow [20] showing the same result for extended Frege systems).

Reference-contexts: There are also some theoretical reasons to think that such results will be hard to obtain. Cook and Urquhart [21] show that in a precisely defined sense there can be no feasibly constructive proof of a super-polynomial lower bound for an extended Frege system. Buss <ref> [12] </ref> and Krajcek and Pudlak [42] have proved further results along the same lines.

Reference-contexts: This family of systems are called "Frege systems" in the literature of proof complexity. Strictly speaking, this is a misnomer, since Frege's original system of propositional logic [28] included a tacitly applied rule of substitution; according to Church <ref> [13, p. 158] </ref>, von Neumann [66] was the first to use axiom schemes to avoid the use of a substitution rule. However, the term "Frege system" seems well entrenched in the complexity literature, so it is employed here. <p> Buss [12] and Krajcek and Pudlak [42] have proved further results along the same lines. We conclude this survey of proof systems by mentioning the quantified propositional calculus, the form of second order logic obtained by adding rules 38 for propositional quantifiers to a Frege system <ref> [13, x28] </ref>. By restricting our atten-tion to theorems not containing propositional quantifiers, we can consider such systems as proof systems for tautologies in the usual sense. Such systems can simulate Frege systems with substitution, but otherwise little is known about their complexity.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, let us assume that there is a polynomially-bounded proof system for TAUT. Let L be a language in N P. By the basic N P-completeness result of Cook <ref> [16] </ref>, L is reducible to the complement of TAUT in the sense that there is a function f 2 L so that for any string x, x 2 L if and only if f (x) 62 T AU T .

Reference-contexts: This is shown by a set of examples due to Cook <ref> [17] </ref>. Cook's construction associates a set of clauses with a labeled binary tree as follows. Let T be a binary tree in which the interior nodes are labeled with distinct variables. <p> Cook's original unpublished proof <ref> [17] </ref> contains a gap; the proof 10 above is joint work of Cook and the present author.

Reference-contexts: This was the first connection to be observed between propositional logic and bounded arithmetic; it appeared in a fundamental paper of Cook <ref> [18] </ref>. The system P V is a free variable system of arithmetic that bears the same relation to the polynomial-time computable functions as Skolem's recursive arithmetic bears to the primitive recursive functions. <p> The next theorem (from Cook <ref> [18] </ref>) emphasizes the power of extended Frege systems; it shows that if a combinatorial principle has a feasibly constructive proof, then the corresponding family of tautologies has polynomial-size proofs in an extended Frege system. <p> Theorem 8.3 If P V ` TRUE (P (x); y) = 1, then there is a function symbol G of P V so that P V ` EF (G (x)) = P (x). This is the main result of Cook <ref> [18] </ref>. A detailed proof is in Dowd [25]. Combined with Dowd's observation that the soundness of a Frege system with substitution is provable in an extended Frege system, it leads immediately to Theorem 8.1.

Reference-contexts: The definitions are adapted from Cook and Reckhow <ref> [20] </ref>. Let be a finite alphabet; we write fl for the set of all finite strings over . A language is defined as a subset of fl , that is, a set of strings over a fixed alphabet . The length of a string x is written as jxj. <p> Thus the basic question P =?N P is the polynomial-time analogue of the halting problem. The importance of our main question for theoretical computer science lies in the following result of Cook and Reckhow <ref> [20] </ref>. Theorem 2.1 N P = coN P if and only if there is a polynomially-bounded proof system for the classical tautologies. Proof. <p> This line of research was first suggested in papers by Cook and Reckhow <ref> [19, 20] </ref>. At the moment, the goal of settling the question N P 6= coN P seems rather distant. However, progress has been made in classifying the relative complexity of well known proof systems, and in proving lower bounds for restricted systems. <p> This theorem serves to separate bounded-depth Frege systems &gt;from Frege systems in the map of proof systems, since Buss [11] shows that the pigeonhole tautologies have polynomial-size proofs in a Frege system (this result improves on the earlier result of Cook and Reckhow <ref> [20] </ref> showing the same result for extended Frege systems).

Reference-contexts: Whereas Skolem's system has a function symbol for each primitive recursive function, P V has one for each polynomial-time computable function; for details, see <ref> [21] </ref>. 37 Cook introduced P V as a way of formalizing the intuitive notion of `feasibly constructive proof': feasibly constructive proof is to polynomial-time algorithm as constructive proof is to algorithm. <p> The foregoing results all emphasize the power of extended Frege systems, and tend to show that proving lower bounds for such systems is a formidable challenge. There are also some theoretical reasons to think that such results will be hard to obtain. Cook and Urquhart <ref> [21] </ref> show that in a precisely defined sense there can be no feasibly constructive proof of a super-polynomial lower bound for an extended Frege system. Buss [12] and Krajcek and Pudlak [42] have proved further results along the same lines.

Reference-contexts: The set A n has a tableau refutation of size n + 1. Somewhat surprisingly, there are cases where truth tables are more efficient than analytic tableaux. This fact was first observed by Marcello D'Agostino, who proved the next result <ref> [22] </ref>. 7 Theorem 4.1 The analytic tableau proof system cannot p-simulate the method of truth tables. Proof. Let n be the set of all clauses of length n in n variables.

Reference-contexts: Clearly the refutation produced depends uniquely on the order of elimination adopted. The name of the procedure derives from a well known paper by Davis and Putnam on automated theorem proving <ref> [24] </ref>. The phrase "Davis-Putnam procedure" is unfortunately ambiguous, since in the literature of automated theorem proving, it refers to a decision procedure for satisfiability involving the recursive construction of a semantic tree.

Reference-contexts: If ` P V t = u then there is a polynomial p (n) so that jt = uj n has an extended Frege proof of length at most p (n) for all n. Proof. A detailed proof is contained in Dowd's thesis <ref> [25] </ref>. 2 The next theorem shows that an extended Frege system can p-simulate any proof system whose soundness is provable in P V . <p> Theorem 8.3 If P V ` TRUE (P (x); y) = 1, then there is a function symbol G of P V so that P V ` EF (G (x)) = P (x).

Reference-contexts: We conclude this section with the observation that a cut-free Gentzen system for a given set of connectives and the corresponding analytic tableau system are p-equivalent. This can be seen most easily by using the form of Gentzen system where the thinning rule is omitted. Then (as Dowd <ref> [26] </ref> first observed) there is a straightforward and efficient translation procedure between the two systems; the details are to be found in Smullyan's book [59, Ch. XI]. <p> Surprisingly, the converse simulation also holds, a result first proved by Dowd <ref> [26] </ref>. Theorem 8.1 Any two systems from the following classes are p-equivalent: extended resolution, extended Frege systems, Frege systems with substitution. Proof.

Reference-contexts: However, an efficient direct translation is not possible, for example, in the case of the connective sets f!; ~; g and f^; ~g. In this case, it is necessary to employ a technique of indirect translation based on the well known construction of Spira [60], [68, pp. 218-221], <ref> [27, pp. 68-73] </ref>. The reader is referred to Reckhow [52] or the book by Krajcek [40] for details of the proof. For general Frege systems only very weak lower bounds on the size of proofs are known. <p> This failure in proving lower bounds mirrors the corresponding lack of success in proving strong lower bounds on the size of formulas or circuits computing explicitly defined Boolean functions (the books by Wegener and Dunne <ref> [27, 68] </ref> provide good surveys of work in this area). Strong lower bounds have been proved only in the case where significant restrictions are placed on the structure of the proofs considered.

(Since the substitution rule is unsound, in proofs from assumptions, we must disallow substitution for variables appearing in assumptions.) It is not hard to prove that a Frege system with the addition of the substitution rule can p-simulate the same system with the extension rule

Since no new irregularities are introduced in the process of removal, the Lemma follows. 2 12 The corresponding lemma for resolution fails. Andreas Goerdt <ref> [33] </ref> shows that there is an infinite sequence of contradictory sets of clauses having polynomial-size resolution refutations for which the size of any regular resolution refutation grows faster than any fixed polynomial. Goerdt's examples are modified versions of the pigeonhole clauses described in Section 7 below.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea of the lower bound proof given below, from Urquhart [63], is due to Armin Haken <ref> [35] </ref>, who introduced an ingenious "bottle-neck" counting argument to prove the corresponding result for the pigeonhole clauses. The analysis of refutations of Clauses (G 0 ) is facilitated by considering those assignments that make exactly one clause in Clauses (G 0 ) false. These are easy to describe. <p> The lower bound sketched below is for proofs of bounded depth, in which all formulas have depth bounded by a fixed constant. The lower bound is based on the propositional pigeon-hole principle, mentioned above as the basis for Haken's exponential lower bound <ref> [35] </ref> for resolution. Let D; R be finite non-empty sets where D " R = ;, and let S = D [ R. <p> The negation of P HP n is equivalent to the conjunction of a set of clauses; Haken <ref> [35] </ref> showed that this set of clauses requires resolution refutations of size c n , for c &gt; 1. The most important step so far in our understanding of the complexity of propositional proofs was taken by Ajtai in a remarkable paper [1] in which he proved the following result.

Reference-contexts: Hence, l cannot occur in any input clause in T , so that the tree resulting from the deletion of l is a refutation of [l := 0]. 2 Regular tree resolution is closely related to the method of semantic trees introduced by Robinson [54] and Kowalski and Hayes <ref> [37] </ref>. A semantic tree is a binary tree in which the nodes have assignments associated with them. The assignment associated with the root is empty.

Reference-contexts: A major area only touched upon here is the proof theory of bounded arithmetic and its relation to the complexity of propositional proofs. The reader is referred to the book by Buss [10] for background in bounded arithmetic. The forthcoming book by Krajcek <ref> [40] </ref> also gives a good introduction to bounded arithmetic, as well as covering most of the basic results in complexity of propositional proofs. 2 Proof systems and simulation The literature of mathematical logic contains a very wide variety of proof systems. <p> In this case, it is necessary to employ a technique of indirect translation based on the well known construction of Spira [60], [68, pp. 218-221], [27, pp. 68-73]. The reader is referred to Reckhow [52] or the book by Krajcek <ref> [40] </ref> for details of the proof. For general Frege systems only very weak lower bounds on the size of proofs are known. <p> The reader is referred to Buss's paper [11] and the book by Krajcek <ref> [40] </ref> for details of this connection. 8 The extension and substitution rules A natural way to extend a Frege system is to allow the possibility of abbreviating formulas by definitions. <p> Hence, in a Frege proof of a tautology that is not a substitution instance of a smaller tautology, all the subformulas must occur as active subformulas somewhere in the proof. (For the details of this result, see Krajcek <ref> [40, Ch. 4] </ref>.) Problem 9.1 Prove a lower bound on the size of Frege proofs that is better than quadratic. The next problem is probably not too difficult, but might require a new idea.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly, the converse simulation also holds, a result first proved by Dowd [26]. Theorem 8.1 Any two systems from the following classes are p-equivalent: extended resolution, extended Frege systems, Frege systems with substitution. Proof. See Krajcek and Pudlak <ref> [41] </ref>. 2 Extended Frege systems are significant in themselves as a natural class of proof systems, but also because of a connection with another form of bounded arithmetic. <p> The reader is referred to the work of Dowd [25] and Krajcek and Pudlak [43]. It is not known whether in the p-simulation ordering there is a greatest element, that is, whether or not there is a propositional proof system that p-simulates all propositional proof systems. Krajcek and Pudlak <ref> [41] </ref> discuss the relation of this question to other well known open problems in computational complexity theory. 9 Open Problems and Acknowledgments The major questions in the area of the complexity of propositional proofs remain unsolved.

Reference-contexts: Cook and Urquhart [21] show that in a precisely defined sense there can be no feasibly constructive proof of a super-polynomial lower bound for an extended Frege system. Buss [12] and Krajcek and Pudlak <ref> [42] </ref> have proved further results along the same lines. We conclude this survey of proof systems by mentioning the quantified propositional calculus, the form of second order logic obtained by adding rules 38 for propositional quantifiers to a Frege system [13, x28].

The reader is referred to the work of Dowd [25] and Krajcek and Pudlak <ref> [43] </ref>. It is not known whether in the p-simulation ordering there is a greatest element, that is, whether or not there is a propositional proof system that p-simulates all propositional proof systems.

Reference-contexts: The expander graph H m is a simple bipartite graph in which each vertex has degree at most 5 and each side contains m 2 vertices (for brevity we write n = m 2 ).

Reference-contexts: Thus g is a feasible translation function that translates proofs in f 1 into proofs in f 2 . We have assumed in the above definition that the language of both proof systems is the same. Reckhow's thesis <ref> [52, x5.1.2] </ref> contains a more general definition of p-simulation that eliminates this restriction. It is easy to see that the p-simulation relation is reflexive and transitive, and also that the following theorem can be proved from the definitions. <p> A more detailed diagram, showing a wider selection of proof systems, though not reflecting work after 1976, is to be found in Reckhow <ref> [52] </ref>. Before proceeding to consider particular proof systems, let us fix our notation. We assume an infinite supply of propositional variables and their negations; a variable or its negation is a literal. <p> Among these are systems obtained by adding the cut rule to cut-free Gentzen systems, and systems of natural deduction containing the deduction theorem as a primitive rule. The statement of this equivalence forms one of the main results in Reckhow's thesis <ref> [52] </ref>. Theorem 7.1 Any two systems from the following classes are p-equivalent: Frege systems, natural deduction systems, Gentzen systems with cut. <p> In this case, it is necessary to employ a technique of indirect translation based on the well known construction of Spira [60], [68, pp. 218-221], [27, pp. 68-73].

Reference-contexts: Interest in the problem arose from two fields connected with computers, automated theorem proving and computational complexity theory. The earliest paper in the subject is a ground-breaking article by Tseitin <ref> [62] </ref>, the published version of a talk given in 1966 at a Leningrad seminar. In the three decades since that talk, substantial progress has been made in determining the relative complexity of proof systems, and in proving strong lower bounds for some restricted proof systems. <p> distinguish between the two by describing the first system as "tree resolution," the second simply as "resolution." Although resolution operates only on clauses, it can be converted into a general purpose theorem prover for tautologies by employing an efficient method of conversion to conjunctive normal form, first used by Tseitin <ref> [62] </ref>. Let A be a formula containing various binary connectives such as ! and ; associate a literal with each subformula of A so that the literal associated with a subformula ~B is the complement of the literal associated with B. <p> In the remainder of this section, the lower bounds proved for various forms of resolution are given for the graph-based examples introduced by Tseitin <ref> [62] </ref>. This paper of Tseitin is a landmark as the first to give non-trivial lower bounds for propositional proofs; although it pre-dates the first papers on N P-completeness, the distinction between polynomial and exponential growth of proofs is already clear in it. <p> Thus, we have reduced the problem of proving lower bounds for tree resolution to that of finding graphs that require large deletion trees. The next result is due in its essentials to Tseitin <ref> [62] </ref>. Theorem 5.2 Tree resolution cannot p-simulate the Davis-Putnam procedure. Proof. For n &gt; 0, let the graph G n consist of N = 2 n vertices v 1 ; : : : ; v N with adjacent vertices v i and v i+1 joined by n edges. <p> As in the case of tree resolution, we define the complexity of a derivation in G T ree to be the number of leaves in the derivation (that is, the number of occurrences of axioms). The simulation in the following theorem is due to Tseitin <ref> [62] </ref>. Theorem 6.1 The system Res () T ree p-simulates G Tree . <p> This idea was first proposed by Tseitin <ref> [62] </ref> in the context of resolution, but is perhaps more natural in the context of axiomatic systems. Let F be a Frege system; for convenience, let us assume that the language of F contains a symbol for the biconditional.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea of the lower bound proof given below, from Urquhart <ref> [63] </ref>, is due to Armin Haken [35], who introduced an ingenious "bottle-neck" counting argument to prove the corresponding result for the pigeonhole clauses. The analysis of refutations of Clauses (G 0 ) is facilitated by considering those assignments that make exactly one clause in Clauses (G 0 ) false.

Reference-contexts: The notion of O-assignment was used earlier in a somewhat different form in <ref> [64] </ref> to prove an exponential lower bound for cut-free Gentzen systems. An exponential lower bound for the tree version of a cut-free Gentzen system was proved earlier by Statman [61]. The formula U n has 2 2n O-assignments associated with it. We are interested only in certain of these. <p> The following result is proved in Urquhart <ref> [64] </ref>. Theorem 6.6 There is a sequence F n of biconditional tautologies, where each formula has length O (n 2 ), but the shortest proof of F n in G contains at least 2 n=16 distinct sequents.

Reference-contexts: We shall say that a derivation of a sequent ` is a 21 derivation in G with the analytic Cut rule if the derivation belongs to G + Cut, and all cut formulas are subformulas of formulas in the conclusion ` . We shall now prove some results from <ref> [65] </ref> that settle the relative complexity of resolution and cut-free Gentzen systems, at least for the case of tautologies involving the biconditional.

Reference-contexts: This family of systems are called "Frege systems" in the literature of proof complexity. Strictly speaking, this is a misnomer, since Frege's original system of propositional logic [28] included a tacitly applied rule of substitution; according to Church [13, p. 158], von Neumann <ref> [66] </ref> was the first to use axiom schemes to avoid the use of a substitution rule. However, the term "Frege system" seems well entrenched in the complexity literature, so it is employed here.

Reference-contexts: We denote this alternative formulation by G 0 . It is the version adopted by Smullyan [59, pp. 105-106], and is usually employed in automatic theorem provers; the system of Wang <ref> [67] </ref> is of this type.

Reference-contexts: However, an efficient direct translation is not possible, for example, in the case of the connective sets f!; ~; g and f^; ~g. In this case, it is necessary to employ a technique of indirect translation based on the well known construction of Spira [60], <ref> [68, pp. 218-221] </ref>, [27, pp. 68-73]. The reader is referred to Reckhow [52] or the book by Krajcek [40] for details of the proof. For general Frege systems only very weak lower bounds on the size of proofs are known. <p> This failure in proving lower bounds mirrors the corresponding lack of success in proving strong lower bounds on the size of formulas or circuits computing explicitly defined Boolean functions (the books by Wegener and Dunne <ref> [27, 68] </ref> provide good surveys of work in this area). Strong lower bounds have been proved only in the case where significant restrictions are placed on the structure of the proofs considered.

Reference-contexts: The substitution rule is another natural rule that appears in the earliest systems for propositional logic, such as those of Frege [28] and Whitehead and Russell <ref> [69] </ref>. (Since the substitution rule is unsound, in proofs from assumptions, we must disallow substitution for variables appearing in assumptions.) It is not hard to prove that a Frege system with the addition of the substitution rule can p-simulate the same system with the extension rule added.
