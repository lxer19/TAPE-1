Abstract: A method for a time-domain Pitch-Synchronous Overlap-and-Add (PSOLA) concatenative speech synthesis system was developed using diphones as the synthesis units. After a search algorithm selects an optimal sequence of units based on phonetic and prosodic continuity (includes phone labels, pitch, duration, and energy) across unit boundaries, PSOLA techniques are applied to combine the units into a synthetic waveform. Informal listening tests determined the speech to be of fair quality. As this method is flexible and scalable, possible applications include generic synthesizers and voice conferencing systems. Future research may include plans to produce more natural sounding speech, integrate the system into a network synthesis server, and derive intonation patterns from algorithms in DECtalk.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Concatenative speech synthesis algorithms are popular, in that they are relatively simple compared to articulatory or terminal-analog methods <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and produce natural-sounding speech. Recently, time-domain concatenative speech synthesis algorithms have become prominent, because of their low computational requirements compared to frequency-based methods. The most popular methods stem from a family of Overlap-and-Add (OLA) algorithms [5]. <p> Excision is performed by detecting glottal impulses marking the beginning of pitch periods. Concatenation is performed by relocating these pitch periods as specified by the externally provided prosodic information. 1 A diphone is a phone-sized unit of speech whose bound-aries lie in the middle of phones <ref> [1] </ref>. It partially spans two phones, because of the choice of boundaries. The diphone is the synthesis unit of choice, because it captures dynamic transitional information between two phones with a relatively small number of units in comparison to the syllable, for example.

Reference-contexts: We regard the entire system to be a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) source-filter model. This assumption permits us to perform pitch period relocation in diphone concatenation, because of the superposition property. As depicted in Figure 1 <ref> [3] </ref>, the simple source model is either a series of glottal pulses or random noise, corresponding to the voiced and unvoiced modes, respectively. The vocal tract acts as a filter to shape the frequency response of the source by introducing additional poles (resonances or formants) and possible zeroes.

Reference-contexts: One complete cycle of glottal vibration is termed a pitch period of length T sec. We can directly estimate the local instantaneous pitch from the equation F 0 = 1 T Hz. We used Sapphire <ref> [4] </ref> to mark the pitch periods, as can be seen in Figure 3. The utterances that we use in this work have been previously phonetically transcribed and time aligned. 2.2.

Reference-contexts: Recently, time-domain concatenative speech synthesis algorithms have become prominent, because of their low computational requirements compared to frequency-based methods. The most popular methods stem from a family of Overlap-and-Add (OLA) algorithms <ref> [5] </ref>. Algorithms of the OLA family have opened the door to more natural-sounding concatenative speech synthesis, because real speech sub-units can now be employed. The branch of OLA algorithm to be considered in this work include the Pitch-Synchronous Overlap-and-Add (PSOLA) variants, which operate at the pitchmark level. <p> Specifically, the Time-Domain PSOLA (TD-PSOLA) algorithm will be used for our concatenative speech synthesis system, as it is effective at performing simultaneous warping in pitch and duration <ref> [5, 8] </ref>. The speech synthesis unit to be used in conjunction with TD-PSOLA is the diphone, a virtual unit of speech which partially spans two phones. The main reason for its appropriateness in concatenative speech synthesis is that it attempts to capture co-articulation between two phones.

Reference-contexts: These can be either manually or automatically transcribed. In this work our corpus has been previously phonetically transcribed. Both time-domain and frequency-domain techniques of automatic pitch extraction exist, but no algorithm is able to achieve 100% accuracy <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. Time-domain and frequency-domain methods usually operate by detecting peaks in the energy contour and the short-time spectra, respectively. We transcribe these marks by hand at the zero-crossings before the epoch to eliminate possible variability in accuracy.
