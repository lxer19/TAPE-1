Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a minimum cost acceptable path on a toroidal grid graph, where each horizontal and each vertical edge have the same orientation. An acceptable path is closed path that makes a complete horizontal and vertical circuit. We exploit the structure of this graph to develop efficient parallel algorithms for a message passing computer. Given p processors and an m by n toroidal graph, our algorithm will find the minimum cost acceptable path in O(mn log(m)=p) steps, if p = O(mn=((m + n) log(mn=(m + n)))), which is an optimal speedup. Also we show that the algorithm will send O(p 2 (m + n)) messages. The solution of this problem has applications in surface reconstruction [6, 5, 9]

Reference-contexts: While Paige and Kruskal's algorithms [10] achieve optimal speedups under certain conditions, the proposed parallel shortest path algorithms are generally either limited in parallelism, or suboptimal. Efficient and optimal algorithms can be found by restricting the problem domain.
