Abstract: Shape matching techniques are important in machine intelligence, especially in applications such as robotics. Currently, there are three major approaches to shape recognition: statistical, syntactic and neural approaches. This paper presents a fourth approach: evolutionary algorithms. A steady state memetic algorithm is shown to be successful in matching shapes even when they are partially obscured, and even in the presence of noise in the input image.

Reference-contexts: Existing approaches to solve the shape recognition problem ([3, 1, 4, 7, 8, 18, 17]) do not perform well in such situations. We show that appropriate evolutionary algorithms perform extraordinarily well for such problems. In related work, Bala and Wechsler <ref> [2] </ref> apply genetic algorithms (GAs) to develop morphological operators for shape classification, not directly for shape matching. Di Ianni [6] uses genetic algorithms (GAs) for matching shapes but the results obtained were not encouraging, possibly because of using raw pixel arrays for the representation of shapes rather than image features.

Reference-contexts: Our research applies such a Memetic Algorithm (MA) that invokes hill climbing after generating offspring using evolutionary operators. This approach has already been applied successfully to several problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (Moscato et al. [9]).

If a person is infected by a meme, that person processes the meme; understands it, adapts it and passes it on, whereas genes get inherited unchanged.
