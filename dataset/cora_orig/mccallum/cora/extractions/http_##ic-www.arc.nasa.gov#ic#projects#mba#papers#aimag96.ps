Abstract: A new generation of sensor rich, massively distributed, autonomous systems are being developed that have the potential for profound social, environmental, and economic change. These include networked building energy systems, autonomous space probes, chemical plant control systems, satellite constellations for remote ecosystem monitoring, power grids, biosphere-like life support systems, and reconfigurable traffic systems, to highlight but a few. To achieve high performance, these immobile robots (or immobots) will need to develop sophisticated regulatory and immune systems that accurately and robustly control their complex internal functions. To accomplish this, im-mobots will exploit a vast nervous system of sensors to model themselves and their environment on a grand scale. They will use these models to dramatically reconfigure themselves in order to survive decades of autonomous operations. Achieving these large scale modeling and configuration tasks will require a tight coupling between the higher level coordination function provided by symbolic reasoning, and the lower level autonomic processes of adaptive estimation and control. To be economically viable they will need to be programmable purely through high level compositional models. Self modeling and self configuration, coordinating autonomic functions through symbolic reasoning, and compositional, model-based programming are the three key elements of a model-based autonomous systems architecture that is taking us into the New Millennium.

Reference-contexts: As a stepping stone towards this ambitious scenario, we developed a testbed for fine grained sensing and control of a suite of offices at Xerox PARC, called the responsive environment <ref> (Elrod et al. 1993) </ref>. This testbed includes a networked control system for the complete building, plus fifteen model offices each of which has been enhanced with a networked microprocessor that controls an array of sensors and actuators. <p> We solve this problem with a gradient descent controller that uses a global model to adaptively predict where the optima lies. An informal evaluation using the responsive environment testbed suggests that energy savings in excess of 30% are conceivable with help from model-based control <ref> (Zhang, Williams, & Elrod 1993) </ref>. Generic thermal models are available for complete buildings (e.g., the DOE2 simulator models) that suffice for this type of control. These models are extremely rich, including not only the building's hardware and nonlinear thermal characteristics, but sunlight and shading, external weather, and the occupants' desires.

In this architecture (see (Pell et al. 1996a) for details) HSTS translates high-level goals into partially-ordered tokens on resource timelines.

Reference-contexts: These are modeled by incorporating formal specifications of concurrent transition systems into the model-based programming language. Concurrent transitions systems provides an adequate formal semantics for most concurrent real-time languages <ref> (Manna & Pnueli 1992) </ref>. Continuous adaptive processes Achieving high fidelity requires the merging of symbolic model-based methods with novel adaptive estimation and control techniques (e.g., neural nets). Specifications of adaptive processes must be combined with specifications of discrete concurrent behavior within the models. <p> Second, Livingstone's representation formalism achieves broad coverage of hybrid discrete/continuous, software/hardware systems 11 by coupling the concurrent transition system models underlying concurrent reactive languages <ref> (Manna & Pnueli 1992) </ref> with the qualitative representations developed in model-based reasoning. Third, the long held vision of model-based reasoning has been to use a single central model to support a diversity of engineering tasks. <p> The restricted propositional temporal logic is adequate for modeling digital hardware, analog hardware using qualitative abstractions (Weld & de Kleer 1990; de Kleer & Williams 1991), and real-time software using the models of concurrent reactive systems in <ref> (Manna & Pnueli 1992) </ref>. The spacecraft transition system model is a composition of its component transition systems in which the set of configurations of the spacecraft is the cross-product of the sets of component modes.

Reference-contexts: Our experience and those of others (Hamscher 1991; Malik & Struss 1996) has shown that extremely weak qualitative representations, e.g., representing only deviations from nominal behavior, are quite sufficient for many model-based autonomy tasks. Counter to the folklore of the field <ref> (Sacks & Doyle 1992) </ref>, ambiguity and intractable branching has not proven to be a significant practical issue. Model-based programming on a large-scale is supported by developing languages, compilers, debuggers, and visualization tools that incorporate classical concepts of object-oriented, procedural, and hierarchical abstractions into the modeling language.

Moriarty's simplification step (currently under development), is based on an order of magnitude simplification method, called caricatural modeling, <ref> (Williams & Raiman 1994) </ref>. Caricatural modeling partitions a model into a set of operating regions in which some behaviors dominate and others become negligible. Mori-arty applies caricatures to each estimation action generated in the first step, using the action's estimator as the model.

Reference-contexts: The kernel that we 5 are driving towards is defined by three desiderata: model-based programming, model-based reactive execution, and model-based hybrid systems. Our work on immobots originated with work on interaction-based design <ref> (Williams 1990) </ref>, which explored the coordination and construction of continuous interactions, as a design task that involves the addition of novel hardware device topologies. In contrast model-based autonomy explores the coordination of hardware and software interactions using a digital controller.
