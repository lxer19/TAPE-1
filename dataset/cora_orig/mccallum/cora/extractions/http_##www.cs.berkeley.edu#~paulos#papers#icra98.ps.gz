Title: Designing Personal Tele-embodiment  
Author: Eric Paulos John Canny 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of California,  
Abstract: At the intersection of tele-robotics, computer networking, and human social interaction we have chosen to explore an area we identify as personal tele-embodiment. At the core of this research is an emphasis on the individual person rather than the intricate complexities of the machine. While the mechanical elements of our system are essential to its overall functionality, our research is driven solely by the study and understanding of the social and psychological aspects of extended human-human interactions rather than the latest techno-gadgetry. In this paper we emphasize the importance of the human component and describe the development of one such simple, inexpensive, internet-controlled, untethered tele-robot or PRoP (Personal Roving Presence) that provides several fundamental elements of personal tele-embodiment.

Reference-contexts: has grown in recent years to describe not only systems involving distant real spaces (i.e. tele-robotics) but also distant virtual spaces or VR. 2 Previous and Related Work Methods of achieving telepresence 2 are not new with one of the first electrically controlled mechanical teleoperational systems being developed by Goertz <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> in 1954. Since then a variety of applications for tele-operated robotics have been explored by numerous researchers. Space does not permit us to include a survey and hence we defer the reader to Sheri-dan [ 18 ] .

Reference-contexts: In essence, telepresence for the masses. The exponential growth of the WWW over the past several years has resulted in a plethora of remote controlled mechanical devices which can be accessed via the WWW.

Reference-contexts: Soon afterwards, we developed Mechanical Gaze [ 16 ] , a tele-robotic system where uses could control a camera's viewpoint and image resolution to observe various museum artifacts placed within the robot's workspace. By 1995, Goldberg had developed another telerobotic system called the TeleGarden <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> in which WWW users are able to observe, plant, and nurture life within a living remote garden. Others have also argued for a human centered approach to robotics.

Reference-contexts: This problem was remedied by incorporating a small movable head (i.e. a camera on a controllable pan-tilt platform) onto the PRoP.
