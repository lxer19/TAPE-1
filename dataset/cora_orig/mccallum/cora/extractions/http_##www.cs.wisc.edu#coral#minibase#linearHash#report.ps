Reference-contexts: I tested the performance and found out that 40% of the pages are overflow pages. This means on average, a record access needs 1.2 disk I/O. The result is the same as that in <ref> [3] </ref>. However, we could also try to use the overall capacity of the index as the trigger condition. I wish I had time to implement this.

Reference-contexts: Concurrency control and recovery are also supported and because of the special structure of the index, some techniques have been used to improve the concurrency. <ref> [4] </ref> Our component is dependent on several other components in MINIREL including Buffer Manager, Space Manager, Lock Manager and Recovery Manager.
