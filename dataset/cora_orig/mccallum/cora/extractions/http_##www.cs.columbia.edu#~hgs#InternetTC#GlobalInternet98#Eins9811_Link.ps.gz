Abstract: Current charging mechanisms in the Internet are restricted mainly to volume and time of the day. We propose a mechanism which allows to use additional information for charging in the edges and core of the network. Links or network clouds will have weights which are dynamic, e.g. based on congestion level. This mechanism covers the current Internet protocol, IPv4, and the future one, IPv6, and in both cases, unicast and multicast. We also provide discussion on how charging using these weights along links or network clouds from edge to edge could be implemented.

Reference-contexts: When the first timer expires the responsible group member sends a IGMP report to inform the multicast router that at least one group member is present. The other group members receive this IGMP report and reset their timers <ref> [3] </ref>. From the above facts, it can be decided whether or not a host/node is allowed to receive or send in a given service class and how much it is permitted to send.

Reference-contexts: 1 Normal link (distance between two routers) 2 link between network clouds 3 important/high maintenance costs 4 . 5 intermediate stages 6 . 8 highly congested, with big maintenance costs TABLE III Weight Range C. Preservation of Loop Protection Two types of loop are possible <ref> [6] </ref>: * Persistent loops due to problems in some static routing tables. * Temporary loops due to lack of synchronisation of dynamic routing table updates. In both cases decrementations of the TTL field eventually leads to the discarding of the packet.

Reference-contexts: IV. Multicast Proposal A. Multicast and Differentiated Services How multicasting can be done within the framework of differentiated services has not yet been explored. The various current multicast protocols Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP), Multi-cast extension for OSPF (open shortest path first) <ref> [7] </ref>, and Protocol- Independent Multicast (PIM) share two procedures in common [8]. The first datagram of a receiver is broadcast to all multicast routers.

Reference-contexts: The TTL value cannot be used to store the fractions of weight as it can only be an integer. For this we propose a message which will carry this information down along a multicast tree. Ways to share the cost of a multicast tree are anal-ysed in <ref> [9] </ref>. Our scheme can be considered to be "Local members and next-hops are allocated identical hops" in their notation which is a one-pass mechanism. We don't require the total number of receivers downstream from each multicast router to be known; just its branching information. <p> Cost division into areas facilitates collective charging and we believe it provides better control than direct division of each link's cost amongst all receivers. Our scheme, if desired, would require minute changes to work with the "All locals are considered as one next hop" (ENHS) scheme discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. C. Weights in Multicast The weight of the link and number of branches must be supplied from each router to the edge to enable fair cost distribution. We refer to this information in each router as its (branch, weight) pair.

Reference-contexts: Extension headers follow the basic header as shown in [4] and <ref> [10] </ref>. Below we define a multicast Branch/Weight header. We propose an IPv6 header with the following structure (see also Figure 5). * As defined, the first byte is the mark for the next header. The choice of header number is left open. (There are some headers already defined [10]). <p> [4] and <ref> [10] </ref>. Below we define a multicast Branch/Weight header. We propose an IPv6 header with the following structure (see also Figure 5). * As defined, the first byte is the mark for the next header. The choice of header number is left open. (There are some headers already defined [10]). Then there is one byte for length. The length byte size allows us to add 84 Branch/Weight pairs which is more than acceptable. * The third byte contains the payment information. * Two bytes follow with the number of branches.

Reference-contexts: Different paths do not influence our weight charging mechanism. For the overall charging mechanism we have to include other parameters like volume, service class, flat rate, etc. Payment can be facilitated by already existing transfer methods such as Micropayment <ref> [11] </ref>. Special application will compute in border routers the costs and can be transferred to those responsible such as end-users/clients or ISPs. VII. Conclusions and Future Work We have shown a mechanism which allows charging based on the path a packet travels.
