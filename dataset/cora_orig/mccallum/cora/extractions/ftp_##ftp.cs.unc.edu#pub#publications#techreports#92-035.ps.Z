Abstract: range" is used to prepare these output files for viewing on a Tektronix 4015 terminal or for plotting on a laser printer. It arranges scale factors and generates labels for the graphic output, providing more appropriate auto-scaling than is done by raw graph(1). This facility is automatically invoked by using any CVIEW command line display option. The X-window Tek mode is compatible for viewing Tektronix 4015 output format. "nowrap" is used to remove phase wrap inherent in the phase output generated by atan2(3) in the interpreter. It uses a heuristic to unwind phase wrap and works pretty well, but is not guaranteed to give correct behavior under all conditions. Where it fails, it's usually pretty obvious to see what's going on in the graphical output. This facility is invoked by using the "-w" option in CVIEW "xline" is used to produce object code which is linked with the interpreter at compile time. It provides the routines for calculating the wave impedance and propagation constant of a transmission line, the input terminal admittance of the transmission line, given its length and load, and the complex output terminal voltage of the transmission line, given its length, load, and input terminal voltage [3]. at compile time. It provides routines for calculating the transmission line parameters used by the "xline" routines from data read using the parser "cable" and "microstrip" commands. The "cable" command allows description of any transmission line according to commonly available catalog data, e.g. for RG58/U. The "microstrip" command uses a transmission line model [4] to calculate the parameters from material properties and cross sectional geometry of a surface layer PCB board run over a ground plane.
