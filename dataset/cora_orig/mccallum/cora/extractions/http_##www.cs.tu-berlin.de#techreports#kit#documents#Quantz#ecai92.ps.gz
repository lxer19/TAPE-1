Abstract: Terminological representation systems can be used to support disambiguation tasks in natural languagepro-cessing as, for example, anaphora resolution. However, due to the restricted expressive power of traditional terminological logics, constructions involving bound anaphora cannot be represented. It is shown that an integration of generalized quantifiers into terminological logics provides the basis for a referential representation of bound anaphora. This integration reveals already existing connections between terminological logics and generalized quantifier theory and is also of interest for non-linguistic applications such as information management systems. Keywords: terminological logics, generalized quantifiers, bound anaphora.

Reference-contexts: Terminological representation systems are currently used in different application areas, such as information management systems or natural language processing. Especially in the latter context terminological logics have been criticized for their restricted representational capacity. Not surprisingly, some authors propose extensions in order to deal with natural language <ref> [1] </ref>. In [13] it is shown, on the other hand, that even an expressively restricted system like BACK [12] can support specific disambiguation tasks as the resolution of certain types of anaphora.

Reference-contexts: The problem is thus to provide a referential account of bound anaphora which allows to represent the discourse referents of quantified and bound noun phrases explictly. This referential account is an alternative to the traditional representations by substitution (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>) or binding (e.g., [6]) and should be of interest independently of its actual realization within terminological logics. (For more details about treatment of bound anaphora in the literature confer [11].) Note that the following is only concerned with an adequate representation of the referential level.

Reference-contexts: For a referential representation we have to capture a dependencybetween the objects referred to by three companies and those referred to by four toxic substances. (Note that the idea of a referential representation via dependency goes back to <ref> [5] </ref>.) In standard quantifier notation this dependency results from the scope ordering, since the substitutions of bound variables depend on the substitutions of variables bound by quantifiers with wider scope. The dependency between discourse referents is represented by the formula ho 1 ; o 2 i := r.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, even probabilistic or fuzzy links like c 1 ff ! c 2 (confer <ref> [7] </ref>) can be represented as ff (c 1 ; c 2 ). A second integration strategy starts with the quantifiers already used in terminological logics. Traditionally, they occur as concept forming operators, relating a role and a concept, as in 8r:c.

Reference-contexts: Note that also the number restrictions can be expressed in the general format q (r; c), yielding qualifying number restrictions (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>). These considerations suggest that q (r 1 ; r 2 ) and q (c; r) are also valid concept terms. The former construct is just a different notation for role value maps, whereas the latter one is hardly used in terminological logics.

Reference-contexts: For an integrated representation of syntactical, semantical, and referential information terminological logics could be integrated with a formalism like HPSG [10]. Such an integration seems feasible because of the close relationship between terminological logics and feature logics (see <ref> [9] </ref>). Note further that I consider only basic examples involving quantified noun phrases as antecedents. I do not consider more complicated constructions involving, for example, plural individuals or VP ellipsis.

The problem is thus to provide a referential account of bound anaphora which allows to represent the discourse referents of quantified and bound noun phrases explictly.

Reference-contexts: [[c]] (7) In the following I will subsequently modify some of these definitions in order to integrate generalized quantifiers. 3 Generalized Quantifiers Research on generalized quantifiers started in the 1950s with the work of Mostowski. (My remarks on generalized quantifiers in this paper owe much to the excellent survey in <ref> [14] </ref>.) His basic idea was to treat quantifiers non-syncategorematically, i.e., to specify denotations for quantifiers themselves. The connection between generalized quantifiers and natural language semantics was established in a seminal paper by Barwise and Cooper [2].
