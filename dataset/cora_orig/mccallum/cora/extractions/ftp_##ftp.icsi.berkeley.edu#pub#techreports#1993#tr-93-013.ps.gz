Abstract: We study optimal stochastic (or Monte Carlo) quadrature formulas for convex functions. While nonadaptive Monte Carlo methods are not better than deterministic methods we prove that adaptive Monte Carlo methods are much better.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction and Result For each (finite) quadrature formula, the error in the class of convex functions on, e.g., <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is not uniformly bounded. For the study of optimal quadrature formulas we therefore have to restrict the class of convex functions somehow. The classes F uv = ff : [0; 1] ! R j f convex, f 0 + (0) u; f 0 where v &gt; u, were studied <p> 1. Introduction and Result For each (finite) quadrature formula, the error in the class of convex functions on, e.g., <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is not uniformly bounded. For the study of optimal quadrature formulas we therefore have to restrict the class of convex functions somehow. The classes F uv = ff : [0; 1] ! R j f convex, f 0 + (0) u; f 0 where v &gt; u, were studied by Glinkin (1984), Zwick (1988), and Novak (1993). The following is known for these classes. Fact 1. Let n 2 N and t i = (2i 1)=(2n). <p> Both these drawbacks are resolved by results of Bra (1982) who studied the classes F 1 = ff : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! R j f convex, kfk 1 1g and e F 1 = ff : [0; 1] ! R j f convex, maxfjf (0)j; jf (1=2)j; jf (1)jg 1g and proved the following. Fact 2. <p> Both these drawbacks are resolved by results of Bra (1982) who studied the classes F 1 = ff : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! R j f convex, kfk 1 1g and e F 1 = ff : [0; 1] ! R j f convex, maxfjf (0)j; jf (1=2)j; jf (1)jg 1g and proved the following. Fact 2. <p> It is, however, much simpler to check the membership f 2 e F 1 than to check f 2 F 1 . 3) F 1 (and also e F 1 ) is indeed a very general class of convex functions. If f is any convex function on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then we have f kfk 1 1 2 F 1 such that error estimates on F 1 easily can be used. <p> Hence, if Q n (fff ) = ffQ n (f ) for all ff 0, the order O ( max (Q n )) of the error does not only hold for f 2 F 1 , but may also be extended to all convex functions on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The algorithm mentioned in our Theorem below has this property. 3 4) We should stress that the analysis and the results for the classes F uv and F 1 (or e F 1 ) are quite different. <p> This problem was posed by Bra in 1981 and solved by Forster and Petras (1990) who even studied the slightly bigger class F 2 = ff : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! R j f convex, f (0) 2f (1=2) + f (1) 4g: Here the constant 4 is chosen in order to have F 1 e F 1 F 2 : The class F 2 also can be compared with the F uv , we have (4) F uv <p> This lower bound gives the optimal order of convergence because we can con struct methods with max (Q ! 5 Remark. Our method (Q ! n ) n2N defined in the proof gives the optimal order n 5=2 of convergence on each class of the form ff : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! R j f convex, f (0) 2f (1=2) + f (1) Kg for K &gt; 0. Hence, this order of convergence holds for each convex function on [0; 1]. 2. Proof The lower bounds are a simple consequence from Fact 4 and (4). <p> defined in the proof gives the optimal order n 5=2 of convergence on each class of the form ff : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! R j f convex, f (0) 2f (1=2) + f (1) Kg for K &gt; 0. Hence, this order of convergence holds for each convex function on [0; 1]. 2. Proof The lower bounds are a simple consequence from Fact 4 and (4). A more detailed analysis would give these lower bounds also for the class F 1 . <p> ; 1 + d 2 8 ; a i ; i1 + d 2 8 ; a m1 ; m2 + 4d 2 8 ; (1; 0); where i = 3; 4; : : : ; m2, and it therefore lies between the x-axis and the hat function h on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, given by h (x) = 4 (m 1) 2 (x (2x 1) + ) : By an argument used in Forster and Petras (1990, proof of Theorem 1), we see that if the second Peano kernel of any linear functional G lies completely below the second Peano kernel of <p> argument used in Forster and Petras (1990, proof of Theorem 1), we see that if the second Peano kernel of any linear functional G lies completely below the second Peano kernel of a linear functional L, then G [f ] L [f ] holds for each convex function f on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The second Peano kernel of L = 13 8 (m 1) 2 dvd (0; 1 and, by definition, each function f 2 F 2 satisfies dvd (0; 1 2 ; 1)[f ] 8.
