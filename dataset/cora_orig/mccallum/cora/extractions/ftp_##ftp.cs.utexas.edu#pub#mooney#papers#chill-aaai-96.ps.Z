Abstract: This paper presents recent work using the Chill parser acquisition system to automate the construction of a natural-language interface for database queries. Chill treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. Starting with a general framework for constructing a suitable logical form, Chill is able to train on a corpus comprising sentences paired with database queries and induce parsers that map subsequent sentences directly into executable queries. Experimental results with a complete database-query application for U.S. geography show that Chill is able to learn parsers that outperform a preexisting, hand-crafted counterpart. These results demonstrate the ability of a corpus-based system to produce more than purely syntactic representations. They also provide direct evidence of the utility of an empirical approach at the level of a complete natural language application.

Reference-contexts: Several current methods learn some symbolic structures such as decision trees (Black et al. 1993; Magerman 1994; Kuhn & De Mori 1995) and transformations <ref> (Brill 1993) </ref>. Zelle and Mooney (1993, 1994) have proposed a method called Chill based on the relational learning techniques of Inductive Logic Programming. To date, these systems have been demonstrated primarily on the problem of syntactic parsing, grouping the words of a sentence into hierarchical constituent structure.

Reference-contexts: The empirical approach replaces hand-generated rules with models obtained automatically by training over language corpora. Recent approaches to constructing robust parsers from corpora primarily use statistical and probabilistic methods such as stochastic grammars (Black, Lafferty, & Roukaos 1992; Periera & Shabes 1992; Charniak & Carroll 1994) or transition networks <ref> (Miller et al. 1994) </ref>. Several current methods learn some symbolic structures such as decision trees (Black et al. 1993; Magerman 1994; Kuhn & De Mori 1995) and transformations (Brill 1993).

Reference-contexts: However, a number of groups participating in the ARPA-sponsored ATIS benchmark for speech understanding have used learned rules to perform some semantic interpretation. The Chronus system from AT&T <ref> (Pieraccini et al. 1992) </ref> used an approach based on stochastic grammars. Another approach employing statistical techniques is the Hidden Understanding Models of Miller, et. al. (1994). Kuhn and De Mori (1995) have investigated an approach utilizing semantic classification trees, a variation on decision trees familiar in machine learning.

Reference-contexts: Control-Rule Induction then employs a general ILP algorithm to learn rules that characterize these contexts. Finally, Program Specialization "folds" the learned control-rules back into the overly-general parser to produce the final parser. Previous experiments have evaluated Chill's performance in learning parsers to perform case-role parsing <ref> (Zelle & Mooney 1993) </ref> and syntactic parsers for portions of the ATIS corpus (Zelle & Mooney 1994; 1996). These experiments have demonstrated that Chill works as well or better than neural-network or statistical approaches on comparable corpora.
