Abstract: Multimedia presentation technology has enormous potential for a myriad of applications including academic classrooms, industrial training, and business presentations. As presentation technology advances, it is possible to incorporate a wider range of media including variable duration media such as simulations and animations. At the same time, users are able to take more control over presentations by controlling the rate and selection of media being played. To make full use of these advances, multimedia systems must support flexible presentations that incorporate many variations in the way they are played. This paper identifies three requirements for flexible presentations and derives four requirements for synchronization of flexible presentations. The paper presents FLexible Interactive Presentation Synchronization (FLIPS), a model for specifying coarse synchronization for flexible presentations. FLIPS supports a wide range of temporal synchronization specifications. It also provides algorithms for attaining a consistent and coherent presentation state in response to user interaction (e.g., skipping to a different slide or selection) and other state-changing events.

Reference-contexts: For fine-grain synchronization, tight time tolerances, exact mapping of media, and constant enforcement is required. One popular solution for fine-grain synchronization is to tie media streams to a timeline and allow them to synchronize to each other by connecting to a common clock <ref> [2] </ref>. For coarse-grain synchronization, time tolerances are not as critical and the mappings only occur at selected points. The three characteristics of a flexible presentation require particular synchronization support. <p> The specification, modeling and enforcement of temporal synchronization has been the subject of much research. Much of this research has addressed static presentations with fixed objects of known duration <ref> [3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7] </ref>. In many schemes, if two sets of objects are specified to be displayed in parallel, their durations not only must be known, but must be exactly equal [8, 3, 4, 7]. <p> It may be difficult or impossible to accurately schedule such media objects in advance. Blakowski [10] classifies synchronization models into 3 principal approaches: Hierarchical [8, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6], timeline based <ref> [11, 2, 12] </ref> and reference points [10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Blakowski states that hierarchical structures do not support adequate abstraction and cannot represent all synchronization conditions. Timelines do not support objects without a deterministic time of presentation. <p> Fine-grain synchronization (e.g. lip-synching) is not handled directly, but is integrated by incorporating composite objects representing fine grain synchronization along with an appropriate displayer such as the Berkeley CM Player <ref> [2] </ref>. We are also working on an authoring tool to support a graphical specification of a presentation, and a specification verifier.

But specifying that two of these reference points are matched is not sufficient to capture all of the requirements of synchronizing two objects. <p> Alternatively, it may be desirable to pause the narrative if all of the slides have not yet been displayed; both streams should complete their display prior to continuing. This relation, similar to the parallel-last of Hoepner <ref> [14] </ref>, can be specified by mutual barriers, the End of the slide is a barrier to the End of the corresponding narrative, and the End of the narrative is a barrier to the End of the slide. This is shown in Figure 8. <p> This is shown in Figure 8. In future references to the architectural presentation, we will assume the master-slave specification, but either specification could be acceptable. A third method of synchronizing the Ends of two objects corresponds to the parallel-first of Hoepner <ref> [14] </ref>, where whichever object reaches the synchronization point first, causes the 10 is driven by the object that reaches its End first other to jump to that point. This is shown in Figure 9.
