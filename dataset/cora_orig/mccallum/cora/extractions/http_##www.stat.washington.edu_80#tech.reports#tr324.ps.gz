Title: Lattice Conditional Independence Models for Contingency Tables with Non-Monotone Missing Data Patterns

Abstract: In the analysis of non-monotone missing data patterns in multinomial distributions for contingency tables, it is known that explicit MLEs of the unknown parameters cannot be obtained. Iterative procedures such as the EM-algorithm are therefore required to obtain the MLEs. These iterative procedures, however, may offer several potential difficulties. Andersson and Perlman (1993) introduced lattice conditional independence (LCI) models for multivariate normal distributions, which can be applied to the analysis of non-monotone missing observations in continuous data (Andersson and Perlman, 1991). In this paper, we consider LCI models for categorical data and show that LCI models may also be applied to the analysis of categorical data with non-monotone missing data patterns. Under a parsimonious set of LCI assumptions naturally determined by the observed data pattern, the likelihood function for the observed data can be factored as in the monotone case and explicit MLEs can be obtained for the unknown parameters. Furthermore, the LCI assumptions can be tested by explicit likelihood ratio tests.

Reference-contexts: The MLEs of the unconstrained parameters p (x 1 ); p (x 2 jx 1 ), and p (x 3 jx 1 ) can be obtained explicitly by standard complete data methods <ref> (see, e.g., Agresti, 1990) </ref>. Then explicit MLEs of the original (constrained) parameter p (x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ) can be reconstructed (see Section 3). <p> Note that there are a few cells having small counts in the fully classified table (Table 6.1 (a)), but the sample sizes n 123 and n 13 are large, so the LR test may still be considered reliable here, although it may be somewhat conservative <ref> (see, e.g., Agresti, 1990, p.246) </ref>. For the sample with 60% incomplete observations, the estimated cell probabilities ^p ijk based on the LCI model, the EM-algorithm and the complete-data method (CD) are presented in Table 6.2.

Reference-contexts: Estimates obtained by deleting observations usually suffer from reduced efficiency, especially when many observations need to be discarded. Andersson and Perlman (1993) introduced lattice conditional independence (LCI) models for multivariate normal distributions, which can be applied to the analysis of non-monotone missing data problems <ref> (Andersson and Perlman, 1991) </ref>. They show that every non-monotone observed data pattern naturally determines a set of LCI restrictions. Under these LCI restrictions, the desirable properties of the monotone case are retained. In particular, the MLEs of the parameters can be obtained explicitly under the LCI assumptions.
