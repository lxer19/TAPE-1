Abstract: Image quantization and digital halftoning are fundamental image processing problems in computer vision and graphics. Both steps are generally performed sequentially and, in most cases, independent of each other. Color reduction with a pixel-wise defined distortion measure and the halftoning process with its local averaging neighborhood typically optimize different quality criteria or, frequently, follow a heuristic approach without reference to any quality measure. In this paper we propose a new model to simultaneously quantize and halftone color images. The method is based on a rigorous cost-function approach which optimizes a quality criterion derived from a simplified model of human perception. It incorporates spatial and contextual information into the quantization and thus overcomes the artificial separation of quantization and halftoning. Optimization is performed by an efficient multiscale procedure which substantially alleviates the computational burden. The quality criterion and the optimization algorithms are evaluated on a representative set of artificial and real-world images showing a significant image quality improvement compared to standard color reduction approaches. Applying the developed cost function we also suggest a new distortion measure for evaluating the quality of color reduction schemes.

Reference-contexts: Several techniques have been proposed for color reduction, most of which obey a two-step scheme: 1. Initially, a color set is selected by minimizing a proper pixel distortion error. Examples are the popular median-cut quantizer <ref> [1] </ref>, octree quantization [2] and the application of a variety of clustering methods like LBG [3], agglomerative clustering [4], sequential scalar quantization [5, 6] or self-organizing networks [7]. In fact, any suitable clustering approach could be used, see [8] for an overview. <p> Several error diffusion filters have been proposed [10, 11, 12]. In addition, numerous dithering [13, 14] and model-based halftoning [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] techniques have been developed. Quantization and digital halftoning are generally performed sequentially <ref> [1, 2, 20, 21, 13, 22, 23] </ref>. Therefore, quantization and halftoning usually optimize different quality criteria. While clustering distortion measures like the well-known K-means cost function are exclusively pixel-based, halftoning techniques rely on spatial information and distribute the distortion error among neighboring pixels. <p> The complete algorithm is summarized in Algorithm I. 4 Results The proposed spatial quantization algorithms are compared with several standard color reduction methods, which all employ both quantization and dithering. As median cut quantizer <ref> [1] </ref> in conjunction with the Floyd-Steinberg (FS) dithering algorithm ppmquant found in the PPM tools by Jef Poskanzer is used. If the image contains a large number of different colors ppmquant employs a uniform quantization step in advance to decrease the histogram size and thus to improve its performance.

In contrast to error diffusion (7) allows only local compensation of quantization errors. This avoids visually disturbing defects like error-accumulation <ref> [13] </ref>. The specific perception models used are spatially isotropic and the filter coefficients have only to be stored once. But an extension to non-isotropic models is already covered by the generic model in (7). <p> In contrast, the Floyd-Steinberg algorithm introduces significant visual distortions by edge effects and over-regular patterns and it is not capable to generate a smooth transition of grey values. As already expected from the results by Bouman et al. <ref> [13] </ref> and confirmed by Fig. 5 the spatial quantization approach in fact reduces the low frequency components of the distortion error by raising the high frequency parts. We present only the spectrum of the error in the luminance. Similar results are obtained for the chromatic color planes.

Reference-contexts: In a common halftoning technique called error diffusion the quantization error is spread to neighboring pixels, i.e. the distortion at neighboring pixels is biased in opposite direction. Several error diffusion filters have been proposed [10, 11, 12]. In addition, numerous dithering [13, 14] and model-based halftoning <ref> [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] </ref> techniques have been developed. Quantization and digital halftoning are generally performed sequentially [1, 2, 20, 21, 13, 22, 23]. Therefore, quantization and halftoning usually optimize different quality criteria. <p> Thus, additional imaginary colors can be generated by digital halftoning as only a spatial average of the micro-variations are perceived. This has been exploited in a broad variety of error diffusion [10, 11, 12], dithering [13, 14] and model-based halftoning <ref> [17, 18, 19] </ref> applications to enhance the quality of quantized color images. To simplify the model of imaginary colors the chosen color space should represent perceived superposition of colors as linear superpositions. A color space with this property is called a uniform color space [32].

One of the key advantages of the DA approach is the inherent splitting strategy. Clusters degenerate at high temperature and they successively split at bifurcations or phase transitions when T is lowered <ref> [27] </ref>. Therefore, at a specific temperature scale an easily measurable effective number K T of clusters is visible. Since the number of effective data points available drastically reduces at coarser resolution levels, splitting strategy and coarse-to-fine optimization should be interleaved.

Reference-contexts: We extend the convergence proof for assignment problems given in [29] to the case of additional continuous parameters and derive efficient mean-field equations for spatial clustering. Both ICM and DA are significantly accelerated by applying multiscale optimization techniques <ref> [30] </ref>. Multiscale optimization can be understood as the minimization of the original cost function over a properly reduced search space and has been shown to substantially accelerate the algorithms for other clustering cost functions [31]. For spatial quantization the corresponding cost functions on coarse image grids are derived. <p> In contrast to most multi-resolution optimization schemes the identical cost function is optimized at all grids in our scheme, solely the variable configuration space is reduced. This strategy is formalized by the concept of multiscale optimization <ref> [30] </ref> and it leads in essence to cost functions redefined on a coarsened version of the original image. <p> Therefore, spatial optimization on coarser grids has a tendency to suppress dithering of colors. Thus a bias towards local minima with homogeneous colors is introduced. On the other hand it is well-known that multiscale coarsening leads to an implicit smoothing of the energy landscape <ref> [30] </ref> and therefore avoids bad local minima.

Reference-contexts: This model is motivated by the extreme convergence between retina and the visual cortex, where neighboring receptors project on one ganglion and groups of ganglions converge to single neurons in the visual cortex (e.g. <ref> [35] </ref>). Thus, a substantial spatial averaging is performed in the early stages of human vision. In a more system theoretic interpretation this models the perception process as a linear system. An early filter model of human perception based on empirical data has been proposed in [36].

Reference-contexts: This avoids visually disturbing defects like error-accumulation [13]. The specific perception models used are spatially isotropic and the filter coefficients have only to be stored once. But an extension to non-isotropic models is already covered by the generic model in (7). For example, ideas from anisotropic diffusion <ref> [40] </ref> could be incorporated by adapting the filter on the luminance gradient to avoid halftoning across object boundaries. Non-isotropic models are implemented by using filter coefficients which depend on the input image, w ij = w ij (x).

The minimization is carried out over the space of factorial distributions Q = Q (M) := i=1 =1 ) to guarantee computational tractability and efficiency.

Reference-contexts: The local Iterative Conditional Mode (ICM)-algorithm [26] is obtained in the T = 0 limit, here m i 2 f0; 1g and m i = M i = 1, iff = arg max ff hHi Q iff . More mathematical details can be found in <ref> [52, 53] </ref>. We now turn to the derivation of mean-field equations for the generic spatial clustering cost function (7),(12). Both ICM and DA are implemented using an efficient bookkeeping scheme. <p> For fixed T the overall alternating minimization scheme can be proven to converge to a local minimum of (22). In the proof given in <ref> [52] </ref> for arbitrary assignment problems the free energy (22) plays the role of a Lyapunov function. Extending the proof to mixed combinatorial problems it is straightforward to show that (29) also decreases the free energy in each step. The mathematical details are given in the appendix.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, the quadratic optimization problem (28) can be solved directly by a minimization algorithm like conjugate gradients. 3.4 Multiscale Annealing Algorithms like K-means [8] or LBG <ref> [54] </ref> efficiently minimize H km defined in (8) by splitting techniques to obtain successive solutions for a growing number of clusters. For ICM we adopt a heuristic from K-means clustering by splitting clusters with high distortion. One of the key advantages of the DA approach is the inherent splitting strategy.
