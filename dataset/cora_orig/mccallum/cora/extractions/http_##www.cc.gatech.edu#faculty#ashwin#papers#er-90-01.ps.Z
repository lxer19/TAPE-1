Abstract: This paper describes how a reasoner can improve its understanding of an incompletely understood domain through the application of what it already knows to novel problems in that domain. Recent work in AI has dealt with the issue of using past explanations stored in the reasoner's memory to understand novel situations. However, this process assumes that past explanations are well understood and provide good "lessons" to be used for future situations. This assumption is usually false when one is learning about a novel domain, since situations encountered previously in this domain might not have been understood completely. Instead, it is reasonable to assume that the reasoner would have gaps in its knowledge base. By reasoning about a new situation, the reasoner should be able to fill in these gaps as new information came in, reorganize its explanations in memory, and gradually evolve a better understanding of its domain. We present a story understanding program that retrieves past explanations from situations already in memory, and uses them to build explanations to understand novel stories about terrorism. In doing so, the system refines its understanding of the domain by filling in gaps in these explanations, by elaborating the explanations, or by learning new indices for the explanations. This is a type of incremental learning since the system improves its explanatory knowledge of the domain in an incremental fashion rather than by learning new XPs as a whole.

These features are definitional of the stereotype. The label question marks features that are in but incomplete. In this case, (AVOIDANCE-GOAL (STATE)) refers to an unknown goal that needs to be filled in when the information comes in. This is represented as a goal with an unknown goal-object.

Reference-contexts: This is a type of inductive category formation [Diet-trich and Michalski, 1981]; however, the generalization process is constrained so that the features selected for generalization are those that are causally relevant to the explanations being indexed <ref> [Flann and Dietterich, 1989] </ref>. AQUA indexes motivational XPs in memory using typical contexts in which the XPs might be encountered (situation indices), as well as character stereotypes representing typical categories of people to whom the XPs might be applicable (stereotype indices) [Ram, 1989].

Reference-contexts: However, this would be very inefficient in complicated situations, where motivational causal chains could be several steps long. To get around this problem, a case-based understander uses pre-stored explanations for stereotypical situations. These explanations represent standard patterns that are observed in these situations, and hence are called explanation patterns <ref> [Schank, 1986] </ref>. When the understander sees a situation for which it has a canned explanation pattern (XP), it tries to apply the XP to avoid detailed analysis of the situation from scratch.

Reference-contexts: This depends on the purpose to which the learned knowledge will be put. Consider the problem of building motivational explanations for the purpose of understanding stories. An understander could construct such explanations by using rules connecting typical goals and plans of people (e.g., <ref> [Wilensky, 1978] </ref>). However, this would be very inefficient in complicated situations, where motivational causal chains could be several steps long. To get around this problem, a case-based understander uses pre-stored explanations for stereotypical situations.
