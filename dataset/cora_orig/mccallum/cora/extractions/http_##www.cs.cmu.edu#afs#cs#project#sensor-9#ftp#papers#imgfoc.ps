Reference-contexts: Extending the model to three dimensions, removing the approximations, extending the model to natural scenes, and verifying and implementing the results experimentally are outlined briefly. 2 2 Introduction Image focusing <ref> [7] </ref> is conventionally regarded as a spatial-domain activity: the focus-controlling parameter (lens-to-sensor plane distance in a camera, focal length in the eye) is presumed to be adjusted with the goal of maximizing the amplitudes of the high spatial frequency image components.

Reference-contexts: The proportionality constant for the second harmonic is exactly one-fourth the proportionality constant for the fundamental. I then use this model to show how a pair of synchronous amplifiers <ref> [8] </ref> tuned to sin wt and cos 2wt could be used in a ratio mode to detect focus precisely, and thus robustly to deduce range-from-focus pixel-by-pixel. 3 Model For geometrical simplicity, and for the accompanying simplicity in the degree and limits of the integrals representing the instrument transmission function 1 ,

Reference-contexts: However for coherent (laser) illumination, where this averaging does not occur, the distinction is important. It is also important in sonar ranging: typical modern acoustic transducers, e.g., the ubiquitous Polaroid <ref> [9] </ref> product, are amplitude (diaphragm displacement) sensitive, whereas typical older transducers, e.g., the carbon granule microphones in telephone mouthpieces, are (I suppose) power sensitive.

Reference-contexts: However the focusing cue is easily discounted: most people have no trouble understanding stereo photos even though focus is confined to the screen-plane, while the conflicting convergence cues are controlled by the offset between corresponding points in the left and right eyes' images <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Hands-on experience in different but analogous problem domains <ref> [11] </ref> leads me to expect that these methods could yield an advantage of several orders-of-magnitude with even cursory attention to good engineering practice. 8 Extensions and Pitfalls Extending the model to spherical optics looks straightforward, although the additional integration over an azimuthal coordinate may involve some messy intermediate algebra.
