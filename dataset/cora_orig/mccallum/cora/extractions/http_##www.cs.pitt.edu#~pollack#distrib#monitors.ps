Abstract: We describe a framework for planning in dynamic environments. A central question is how to focus the sensing performed by such a system, so that it responds appropriately to relevant changes, but does not attempt to monitor all the changes that could possibly occur in the world. To achieve the required balance, we introduce rationale-based monitors, which represent the features of the world state that are included in the plan rationale, i.e., the reasons for the planning decisions so far made. Rationale-based monitors capture information both about the plan currently under development and the alternative choices that were found but not pursued. We discuss the plan transformations that may result from the firing of a rationale- based monitor, for example when an alternative choice is detected. We have implemented the generation of and response to rationale-based monitoring within the Prodigy planner, and we describe experiments that show the feasibility of our approach.

Reference-contexts: For instance, in Prodigy it is embodied in the use of conspiracy numbers <ref> (Blythe & Veloso 1992) </ref>; in partial-order causal link (POCL) systems such as UCPOP (Penberthy & Weld 1992), it is a component of most node-selection strategies.

Reference-contexts: These techniques have been combined in conditional, probabilistic systems such as C-Buridan (Draper, Hanks, & Weld 1994) and Weaver <ref> (Blythe 1998) </ref>. Utility-based and decision-theoretic planning systems, (e.g., (Drummond & Bresina 1990; Haddawy & Suwandi 1994; Williamson & Hanks 1996; Onder & Pollack 1997) move away from the assumption of categorical goals. <p> One approach has been to rely on techniques for planning under uncertainty, treating exogenous changes that can be partly anticipated in a manner analogous to the way in which uncertain actions are treated; this approach has been taken both within a traditional planning framework <ref> (Blythe 1998) </ref>, and is also inherent in the MDP literature.

Reference-contexts: Utility-based and decision-theoretic planning systems, (e.g., (Drummond & Bresina 1990; Haddawy & Suwandi 1994; Williamson & Hanks 1996; Onder & Pollack 1997) move away from the assumption of categorical goals. Finally, the work on Markov decision processes, e.g. <ref> (Boutilier, Dean, & Hanks 1995) </ref>, can be seen as aimed at addressing both the assumptions of determinacy and categoricity of goals. Less work has been done on removing the assumption of a static environment.

Reference-contexts: The need to balance sensitivity to environmental change against appropriate stability of the plans being formed is strongly reminiscent of the ideas that led to the design of the IRMA architecture and filtering strategy <ref> (Bratman, Is- rael, & Pollack 1988) </ref>. To achieve the needed balance, we introduce a mechanism called rationale-based monitoring. Planning is strongly identified as a decision making process and the planning system itself records the rationale for the choices it makes.

Reference-contexts: These transformations capture the core of the changes that occur when planning and sensing are interleaved. We have been also investigating refinements of these transformations, in particular in terms of a rich taxonomy of goal transformations <ref> (Cox & Veloso 1998) </ref>. During plan generation, each monitor can be tagged with the plan transformation (s) it may suggest. When a monitor fires, deliberation can then determine whether any of the suggested transformation should be performed.

Reference-contexts: Other preconditions will be initially false; should they become true, then the portions of P that established them may become unnecessary. These types of dependencies have been recognized in the work on execution monitoring as far back as the development of triangle tables <ref> (Fikes, Hart, & Nilsson 1972) </ref>. We are performing this monitoring during the planning process|not just during execution|and are also considering a wider set of monitors and using them for a wider set of transfor <br>- mations.

Reference-contexts: The planner then monitors only those environmental changes that would affect the truth-value of the planning rationale. We have implemented a version of rationale-based monitoring within the Prodigy system <ref> (Veloso et al. 1995) </ref>, but the rationale-based monitoring technique could readily be applied to other planning systems as well. We describe controlled experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of rationale- based monitoring in dynamic environments. <p> Implementation We have implemented planning with rationale-based monitors within the Prodigy4.0 planner <ref> (Veloso et al. 1995) </ref>. Table 2 sketches the overall algorithm. Prodigy4.0 is a state-space nonlinear planner. On its primary cycle it may do one of two things.
