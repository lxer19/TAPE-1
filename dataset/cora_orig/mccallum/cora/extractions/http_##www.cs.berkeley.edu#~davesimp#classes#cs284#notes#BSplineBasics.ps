Reference-contexts: Knot insertion In this section, we discuss the most important CAGD contribution to (univariate) spline theory, viz., the idea of knot insertion (a.k.a. subdivision), particularly as introduced and practiced by Boehm; see <ref> [BBB87] </ref> for such things as the Oslo algorithm. Since the spline order, k, will not change in this section, we will usually suppress it and write B i instead of B ik , i instead of ik , etc.

Reference-contexts: The two books on splines, [B78] and [Schu81], which have appeared since 1975, cover B-splines in the traditional way. As presentations of splines from the CAGD point of view, the survey article <ref> [BFK84] </ref> and the "Killer B's" [BBB85,87] are particularly recommended. I refer you to these references and to the original papers referred to there if you are curious about just who contributed (and when and how) to the material essayed here.

Reference-contexts: That lecture was solidly based on [BH87] which covers more or less the same material, in a less elaborate way and without any figures, in just seven pages. The relevant literature on (univariate) B-splines up to about 1975 is summarized in <ref> [B76] </ref> which also contains hints of the most exciting developments concerning B-splines since then: knot insertion and the multivariate B-splines. The two books on splines, [B78] and [Schu81], which have appeared since 1975, cover B-splines in the traditional way.

Reference-contexts: Background This essay is a slight reworking (and correction) of the lecture notes for the first of four lectures in the course entitled "The extension of B-spline curve algorithms to surfaces" given at SIGGRAPH'86. That lecture was solidly based on <ref> [BH87] </ref> which covers more or less the same material, in a less elaborate way and without any figures, in just seven pages.

Reference-contexts: This term was chosen by Schoenberg <ref> [Scho69] </ref> because of a connection to Whittaker's Cardinal Series. This is not to be confused with its use in earlier spline literature where it refers to a spline which vanishes at all points in a given sequence except for one at which it takes the value 1.
