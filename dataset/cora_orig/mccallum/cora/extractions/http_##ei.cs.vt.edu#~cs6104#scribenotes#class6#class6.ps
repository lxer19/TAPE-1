Abstract: This class continued the review of complexity theory. After reviewing Homework Assignment 1, we defined the notions of many-to-one reductions, polynomial time reductions, and NP-completeness. We discussed various complexity classes relating to time complexity, space complexity, and randomized complexity, e.g., P , N P , EXP T IM E, P SP ACE, RP , BP P , and ZP P . At the end of class, we started to discuss parallel complexity and Boolean circuits.
