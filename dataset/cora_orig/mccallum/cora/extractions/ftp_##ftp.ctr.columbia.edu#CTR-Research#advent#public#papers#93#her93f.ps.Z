Abstract: In this paper we examine the circumstances under which a discrete-time signal can be exactly interpolated given only every M -th sample. After pointing out the connection between designing an M -fold interpolator and the construction of an M -channel perfect reconstruction filter bank, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the signal under which exact interpolation is possible. Bandlimited signals are one obvious example, but numerous others exist. We examine these and show how the interpolators may be constructed. A main application is to iterative interpolation schemes, used for the efficient generation of smooth curves. We show that conventional bandlimited interpolators are not suitable in this context. We illustrate that a better criterion is to use interpolators that are exact for polynomial functions. Further, we demonstrate that these interpolators converge when iterated. We show how these may be designed for any polynomial degree N and any interpolation factor M . This makes it possible to design interpolators for iterative schemes to make best use of the resolution available in a given display medium.

Reference-contexts: In words: it is a signal at a higher rate, which contains all the samples of the lower rate signal. A description and examination of discrete-time interpolation schemes is given in <ref> [1] </ref>. Generally we desire that the interpolated signal should resemble the input in some way. That is, it should have the same shape, or the interpolated values should smoothly follow the trend set by the sample points. <p> Generally we desire that the interpolated signal should resemble the input in some way. That is, it should have the same shape, or the interpolated values should smoothly follow the trend set by the sample points. In the approaches in <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref> this was achieved by forcing P (z) to be a lowpass filter. Thus the interpolated signal looks like an oversampled version of the original, in that it is approximately bandlimited to 1=M of the Nyquist frequency. <p> Thus some compromise is necessary, and it is not possible to interpolate even perfectly bandlimited functions with finite complexity. Realizable exact interpolation for other reasonable classes of functions is possible however. Further, interpolators designed based on lowpass criteria, such as in <ref> [1] </ref>, are often not suitable for use in iterative interpolation schemes, in that after several iterations the curve can appear far from smooth. In the case of iterative interpolation we find that a better criterion is that the scheme converges in a well-behaved way. <p> Thus every M -th sample of the impulse response (except the central one) is zero. This is what is referred to as the a trous condition in [14]. We will refer to any sequence with this property as an M -fold interpolator, or interpolation filter <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> If an FIR interpolation filter is required, then standard window procedures can be used to get a finite-length approximation to the impulse response in (24). Other optimization procedures for FIR interpolation filters are given in <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. We will see in the next section that interpolators based on exact interpolation of polynomials can do better than bandlimited approximation. 4 Continuous-time interpolation and subdivision The emphasis so far has been on interpolating a discrete-time sequence from every M -th sample.

Reference-contexts: Hence we wish to investigate the condition where the interpolation is exact.

We will assume familiarity with the basics of the filter bank literature. Consider the structure shown in Figure 3. <p> There are many ways of representing a multirate filter bank; a popular choice is the polyphase matrix <ref> [4, 5] </ref> [H p (z)] ij = H ij (z); so that 2 6 6 4 H 1 (z) H M1 (z) 7 7 5 2 6 6 1 . . . 3 7 7 : (5) Similarly the filters G i (z) are obtained from the polyphase synthesis matrix [G <p> i (z) are obtained from the polyphase synthesis matrix [G p (z)] ij = G ij (z): [G 0 (z) G 1 (z) G M1 (z)] = [1 z z M1 ] G p (z M ): (6) Now it can be shown that the system is perfectly reconstructing if <ref> [4, 5] </ref> G T The M -phase decomposition system already described clearly achieves perfect reconstruction, since both analysis and synthesis polyphase matrices are the identity. <p> We should observe that solving linear equations to find the filters in a filter bank, which is all that we are doing, has been used often before, for example <ref> [37, 5, 30] </ref>. Remarks: 1. In the limiting case where L K = 1 there are no equations to solve. <p> The link between the discrete-time and continuous-time versions of the problem is established by mimicking the analysis of [16]. There a link was formed between the expansion of discrete-time signals using filter banks <ref> [31, 40, 5] </ref>, and the expansion continuous-time functions using wavelets [41, 42]. 4.1 Interpolating continuous-time signals from evenly spaced samples Assume that x a (t) is a function of t, with Fourier transform X a ().

Reference-contexts: For example in [12, 13, 5] filter banks are used to derive sampling results, but using more than one channel. The connection between interpolation schemes and filter banks appears to have been first mentioned in <ref> [14, 15] </ref> for the two-channel case, where it was shown that the minimum length symmetric interpolator which is exact for polynomials of degree &lt; 2N 1 is identical to H (z)H (z 1 ), where H (z) is the Daubechies filter [16] of length 2N . <p> Thus every M -th sample of the impulse response (except the central one) is zero. This is what is referred to as the a trous condition in <ref> [14] </ref>. We will refer to any sequence with this property as an M -fold interpolator, or interpolation filter [1]. <p> The set of signals that is interpolated are those X (z) for which X (z)P (z) = 0. The first work to draw attention to the connection between two-channel filter banks and interpolators appears to be <ref> [14] </ref>. As also noted in [26], the filter in an orthonormal wavelet scheme is the "square root" of some interpolation filter. 2. Lemma 2.1 implies that the M -fold interpolator is a very special function: it crosses zero at every M -th sample (except for the central term). <p> Since all of the roots are at the same location, it follows from Proposition 3.2 that such functions can be interpolated exactly using an M -fold scheme for arbitrarily large M. The M = 2 case was studied in <ref> [14] </ref>. The importance, as we will demonstrate in Section 4, is that interpolators that are exact for polynomial functions are guaranteed to converge to smooth functions when used iteratively. <p> In the M = 2 case, the minimum length interpolator that is exact for polynomials of some degree N , is known to converge to a function that has a number of derivatives that grows linearly with N <ref> [16, 14] </ref>. For larger M the situation appears to be that the minimum length interpolator converges to a function where the number of derivatives grows linearly with N for M even, and proportional to log N for M odd [48]. <p> Obviously this is a simple example. However, for realistic curve generation problems the ability to interpolate by arbitrary factors M , while preserving the desirable convergence is very important.

Reference-contexts: For larger M the situation appears to be that the minimum length interpolator converges to a function where the number of derivatives grows linearly with N for M even, and proportional to log N for M odd <ref> [48] </ref>. Once convergence of the product is assured the signal can be written x a (t) = n=1 where (w) = k=0 ): In other words the infinite iteration of the discrete-time interpolation gives a function that can be used to interpolate a continuous-time function from its evenly-spaced samples.
