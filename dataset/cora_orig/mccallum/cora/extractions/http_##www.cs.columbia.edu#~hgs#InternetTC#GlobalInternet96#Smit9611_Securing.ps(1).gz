Abstract: We analyze the security of the BGP routing protocol, and identify a number of vulnerabilities in its design and the corresponding threats. We then present a set of proposed modifications to the protocol which minimize or eliminate the most significant threats. The innovation we introduce is the protection of the second-to-last information contained in the AS PATH attributes by digital signatures, and the use of techniques developed for detecting loops in path-finding protocols to verify the selected route's path information. With these techniques we are able to secure full path information in near constant space, and avoid the recursive protection mechanisms previously assumed necessary.

Reference-contexts: The DNS Security Extensions <ref> [4] </ref> might meet these requirements. 3 BGP Threats and Vulnerabilities We now identify the threats to which BGP is susceptible, and the vulnerabilities these threats exploit.

Reference-contexts: It is possible that a non-routing host could serve as the BGP speaker, gathering routing information from internal or other external routing protocols, and advertising that information to internal and neighboring external border routers. This feature is currently in use in the Route Servers of the Routing Arbiter project <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While in general these issues do not involve routing protocol mechanisms, two exceptions include the ability to use multiple paths to a single destination, and the inclusion of authentication and access control mechanisms in the packet forwarding function (e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>). We will not address these measures further in this paper. 4 BGP Security Countermeasures The general outline of our proposed countermeasures is as follows: * Encrypt all BGP messages between peers using session keys exchanged at BGP link establishment time.

Reference-contexts: In practice, this definition is relaxed to allow multiple intra-domain protocols and several sets of metrics, the focus being on a single administration. Two inter-domain, path-vector routing protocols currently defined are the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [20] and the Inter-Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP) <ref> [19, 7] </ref>; these two protocols are of particular interest because of their current roles as the inter-domain protocols maintaining the global Internet routing infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: In addition, a link may be subverted by compromising lower layer protocols in use on the link in a manner that allows control of the channel. An example of such an attack is the TCP session hijacking <ref> [8] </ref> attack. 3.2 Deception or Disruption of Routing Messages There are a number of vulnerabilities that allow a strategically placed intruder to fabricate, modify, replay, or delete routing information. With these capabilities, an intruder can compromise the network in a number of ways.

Reference-contexts: Countermeasures to these vulnerabilities will depend on mechanisms in the network or lower layers of the protocol hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Route Selection: Time: The time to verify signatures for each link. This cost will only be incurred twice for each used link: once for the ADD and once for the DELETE. 5 Related Work Kumar <ref> [12] </ref> analyzes the security requirements of network routing protocols, and discusses the general measures needed to secure the distance-vector and link-state routing protocol classes. He identifies two sources of attacks: subverted routers, and subverted links.

Reference-contexts: For distance-vector protocols this translates to the modification or replay of routing updates. The specific countermeasures proposed by Kumar are neighbor-to-neighbor digital signature of routing updates, the addition of sequence numbers and timestamps to the updates, and the addition of acknowledgments and retransmissions of routing updates. Kumar and Crowcroft <ref> [13] </ref> perform a similar analysis of inter-domain protocols, and come to similar conclusions as the previous paper for providing security of distance-vector related routing protocols (they specifically address the path-vector routing protocol IDRP). The one addition they make is to encrypt neighbor-to-neighbor updates.

Reference-contexts: How this is achieved depends on the design and configuration of existing access control mechanisms. A masquerading BGP speaker occurs when a node successfully forges an authorized BGP speaker's identity. This can be accomplished using the IP spoofing <ref> [14] </ref> or source routing attacks. There are a number of forms that a subverted link can take.

Reference-contexts: We feel this is important as BGP speakers are potentially vulnerable to attacks from a number of sources, with potentially catastrophic results from success. Murphy <ref> [15] </ref> outlines a solution for securing distance-vector protocols that involves including the information used to select a route, signed by the neighbor it received it from, in the routing update it then signs and transmits to its neighbors.

Reference-contexts: This allows the verification of the path information in a manner similar to that used in path-finding algorithms to detect loops <ref> [16] </ref>. * Digitally sign all unchanging UPDATE fields whose values are fixed on creation by the BGP speaker originating or most recently aggregating the route. This provides for the integrity and authen ticity of not only these fields, but also of the full AS PATH. <p> In summary, we show that it is possible to effectively and efficiently secure the BGP routing protocol. Our primary means to accomplish this is the cryptographic protection of the predecessor information existing in the BGP protocol, and techniques developed in path-finding routing protocols <ref> [2, 16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Disruption is an event that interrupts or prevents the correct operation of system services or functions. And, usurpation is an event that results in control of system services or functions by an unauthorized entity. Vulnerabilities and threats are minimized or eliminated through the provision of six security services <ref> [17] </ref>. Confidentiality is the protection of data so it is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. Integrity is the protection of data so it is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. Authenticity is the verification of the identity claimed by a system entity.

Reference-contexts: The main difficulty introduced by a sequence number is how to maintain it in the context of arbitrary software and hardware failures. Techniques such as those proposed by Perlman in <ref> [18] </ref> could be used. However, if cycling of the sequence number must be supported, the following process can be used. Each BGP speaker maintains an UPDATE message sequence number database on a per BGP speaker &lt;domain name, public key&gt; pair basis.

A BGP speaker is a host in the network that executes the BGP protocol. BGP peers are two BGP speakers that form a connection and engage in a BGP dialog. <p> This feature is currently in use in the Route Servers of the Routing Arbiter project [5]. We make the following assumptions in designing security mechanisms for BGP: * The BGP version 4 protocol as defined in <ref> [20] </ref>. * A BGP speaker can trust its internal peers. * A BGP speaker can trust information it receives from external speakers only concerning links incident on the AS the external speaker belongs to. * Intruders have capabilities as described in Section 3.1. * Key distribution is based on domain names,
