Reference-contexts: Another critical problem for implementing single-address space codes on distributed memory architectures is interprocessor communication. FLIC does not analyze data dependencies and generate communication. However, this is well within the capability of source translators <ref> [1, 4] </ref> and is a future enhancement for the FLIC tool. 2 Overview FLIC is a precompiler, as distinguished from a preprocessor.

Reference-contexts: Finally, boundary conditions specified implicitly as loop ranges do not hold, because the loop ranges are global whereas the loop variable is used as a local index. 1 All of these problems have been successfully addressed using run-time systems and par-allel libraries. A number of available packages <ref> [2, 3, 5, 6] </ref> provide the necessary looping and index translation information to the program at run time. However, looping statements and index expressions must be modified from their original form to use this run-time information, introducing enough parallel artifact to hinder a same-source software approach.
