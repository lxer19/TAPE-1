Abstract: We rigorously present the geometric issues related to binocular imaging. We identify the minimum number and most fundamental conceptual set of parameters needed to define 3D-stereoscopic camera and display systems; the fundamental parameter that is needed to specify a 3D-stereoscopic system but not a monocular system is the pupillary distance. We analyse the constraints that are imposed on the values of the parameters by the requirement that the imagery be geometrically indistinguishable from the reality that would be perceived by the "naked" human visual apparatus. We relate our approach to those employed by several well known textbooks and graphics engines.

Reference-contexts: Visualizing the natural motions of the Display Screen and eyes requires extensive and convoluted calculations. Nevertheless the package can be used to create perfect stereoscopic images; however the viewer's interaction with these images is necessarily difficult to program. Also the paragraphs devoted to the topic <ref> (pp. 7-1 through 7-15) </ref> contain mistakes, misprints and incorrect figures.*** ***We would be happy to share our errata with interested readers. 5. POSSIBLE GENERALIZATIONS We have discussed in detail the case when both eyes use one flat rectangular Display Screen.
