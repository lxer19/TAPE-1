Abstract: This memo discusses a proposed extension to the Internet architecture and protocols to provide integrated services, i.e., to support real-time as well as the current non-real-time service of IP. This extension is necessary to meet the growing need for real-time service for a variety of new applications, including teleconferencing, remote seminars, telescience, and distributed simulation. This memo represents the direct product of recent work by Dave Clark, Scott Shenker, Lixia Zhang, Deborah Estrin, Sugih Jamin, John Wroclawski, Shai Herzog, and Bob Braden, and indirectly draws upon the work of many others.

Reference-contexts: RSVP, a resource setup protocol compatible with the assumptions of our IS model [RSVP93a, RSVP93b]. 2 Elements of the Architecture The fundamental service model of the Internet, as embodied in the best-effort delivery service of IP, has been unchanged since the beginning of the Internet research project 20 years ago <ref> [CerfKahn74] </ref>. We are now proposing to alter that model to encompass integrated service. From an academic viewpoint, changing the service model of the Internet is a major undertaking; however, its impact is mitigated by the fact that we wish only to extend the original architecture.

Reference-contexts: This in turn requires flow-specific state in the routers, which represents an important and fundamental change to the Internet model. The Internet architecture was been founded on the concept that all flow-related state should be in the end systems <ref> [Clark88] </ref>. Designing the TCP/IP protocol suite on this concept led to a robustness that is one of the keys to its success. <p> Unused state is timed out by the routers. If the route changes, the refresh messages automatically install the necessary state along the new route. The SS approach was chosen to obtain the simplicity and robustness that have been demonstrated by connectionless protocols such as IP <ref> [Clark88] </ref>. 5.2 Routing and Reservations There is a fundamental interaction between resource reservation set up and routing, since reservation requires the installation of flow state along the route of data packets. <p> However, our goal is to simply extend the Internet architecture, not replace it. The fundamental connectionless internet layer <ref> [Clark88] </ref> has been highly successful, and we wish to retain it as an architectural foundation. We propose instead to modify somewhat the pure datagram forwarding mechanism of the present Internet to accomodate IS. There are four routing issues faced by a reservation setup protocol such as RSVP. 1.

Reference-contexts: The requirements and mechanisms for integrated services have been the subjects of much discussion and research over the past several years (the literature is much too large to list even a representative sample here; see the references in <ref> [CSZ92, Floyd92, Jacobson91, JSCZ93, Partridge92, SCZ93, RSVP93a] </ref> for a partial list). This work has led to the unified approach to integrated services support that is described in this memo. We believe that it is now time to begin the engineering that must precede deployment of integrated services in the Internet. <p> Section 2 of this memo introduces the elements of an IS extension of the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Here, the sharing is defined by a tree with shares assigned to each leaf node. An idealized fluid model of instantaneous link-sharing with proportional sharing of excess is the fluid processor sharing model (introduced in <ref> [DKS89] </ref> and further explored in [Parekh92] and generalized to the hierarchical case) where at every instant the available bandwidth is shared between the active entities (i.e., those having packets in the queue) in proportion to the assigned shares of the resource.

This core service model addresses those services which relate most directly to the time-of-delivery of packets. We leave the remaining services (such as routing, security, or stream synchronization) for other standardization venues.

This work has led to the unified approach to integrated services support that is described in this memo. We believe that it is now time to begin the engineering that must precede deployment of integrated services in the Internet. <p> We note that the CSZ scheme is not mandatory to accomplish our service model; indeed for parts of the network that are known always to be underloaded, FIFO will deliver satisfactory service. There is another component that could be considered part of the packet scheduler or separate: the estimator <ref> [Jacobson91] </ref>. This algorithm is used to measure properties of the outgoing traffic stream, to develop statistics that control packet scheduling and admission control.

Reference-contexts: The admission control algorithm must be consistent with the service model, and it is logically part of traffic control. Although there are still open research issues in admission control, a first cut exists <ref> [JCSZ92] </ref>. Admission control is sometimes confused with policing or enforcement, which is a packet-by-packet function at the "edge" of the network to ensure that a host does not violate its promised traffic characteristics. We consider policing to be one of the functions of the packet scheduler. <p> A recent proposal, which is likely to provide better link utilization, is to program the router to measure the actual usage by existing packet flows, and to use this measured information as a basis of admitting new flows <ref> [JCSZ92] </ref>. This approach is subject to higher risk of overload, but may prove much more effective in using bandwidth. Note that while the need for admission control is part of the global service model, the details of the algorithm run in each router is a local matter.

The flowspec is carried by the reservation setup protocol, passed to admission control for to test for acceptability, and ultimately used to parametrize the packet scheduling mechanism. integrated services.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we propose to use the existing internet-layer protocol (e.g., IP or CLNP) for real-time data. Another approach would be to add a new real-time protocol in the internet layer <ref> [ST2-90] </ref>. Our unified stack approach provides economy of mechanism, and it allows us to fold controlled link-sharing in easily. It also handles the problem of partial coverage, i.e., allowing interoperation between IS-capable Internet systems and systems that have not been extended, without the complexity of tunneling. <p> At each node, a local reconciliation must be performed between the offered and the requested flowspec to create a reservation, and an appropriately modified requested flowspec is passed on. This two-pass scheme allows extensive properties like allowed delay to be distributed across hops in the path <ref> [Tenet90, ST2-90] </ref>. Further work is needed to define the amount of generality, with a corresponding level of complexity, that is required in the reservation model. 4 Traffic Control Mechanisms We first survey very briefly the possible traffic control mechanisms. <p> One approach would be to abandon the IP datagram model for a virtual circuit model, in which a circuit is set up with specific service attributes, and the packet carries a circuit identifier. This is the approach of ATM as well as protocols such as ST-II <ref> [ST2-90] </ref>. Another model, less hostile to IP, is to allow the classifier to look at more fields in the packet, such as the source address, the protocol number and the port fields. <p> Under the HS approach, this state is created and deleted in a fully deterministic manner by cooperation among the routers. Once a host requests a session, the "network" takes responsibility for creating and later destroying the necessary state. ST-II is an example of the HS approach <ref> [ST2-90] </ref>. Since management of HS session state is completely deterministic, the HS setup protocol must be reliable, with acknowledgments and retransmissions. In order to achieve deterministic cleanup of state after a failure, there must be some mechanism to detect failures, i.e., an "up/down" protocol.
