Title: Image Replacement through Texture Synthesis  
Author: Homan Igehy Lucas Pereira 
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Stanford University  
Abstract: Photographs and images often have regions which are in some sense flawed. Often, there may be a stain or an undesired feature covering a significant portion of the image, and an algorithm that can fix the image is desired. We propose a technique based on Heeger and Bergens texture synthesis algorithm [4]. By integrating a composition step into the aforementioned algorithm, one portion of the image can be substituted with a synthetic texture derived from another portion of the image. The goal of this synthetic texture is to create a plausible patch without visible seams or repetitive features. We compare this technique, which works on areas that are stochastic in nature, with other variations of image replacement which utilize a combination of image composition and texture synthesis.

Reference-contexts: First, Match-Histogram is used to force the intensity distribution of noise to match the intensity distribution of target. Then an analysis pyramid is constructed from the target texture. The pyramid representation can be chosen to capture features of various sizes (by using a Laplacian pyramid <ref> [1, 2, 6] </ref>) as well as features of various orientations (by using a steerable pyramid [3, 8]). Then, the noise is modified in an iterative manner.

Also, as a preprocess, we use the mask to replace the flawed region of the original with the average color of the target image to avoid low-frequency color bleeding from the flawed region. Matching is then done on the newly composited noise image.

Reference-contexts: Since synthetic tex tures may be created with arbitrary size, repetition artifacts are avoided. Furthermore, by integrating a composition step into our texture synthesis algorithm, boundary problems are reduced. 2 Algorithm Heeger and Bergen <ref> [4] </ref> have developed an algorithm which can synthesize a texture that matches the appearance of a given target texture. While the algorithm does not work well on deterministic textures (e.g., a tile floor, a brick wall), it is effective on stochastic textures (e.g., granite, stucco). <p> We extend this algorithm with a composition step in order to allow seamless integration of synthetic and real textures. Our image replacement algorithm, Texture-Replace, is illustrated in Figure 1. The bold text denotes additions made to the original texture synthesis algorithm described in <ref> [4] </ref>, but we will first briefly describe the original algorithm. The inputs into the original algorithm are a target texture and a noise image (e.g., white noise, fractal noise). By the end of the algorithm, noise will have been converted into a synthetic texture. <p> Figure 3a uses our Texture-Replace algorithm with a smooth mask. In Figure 3b, a binary mask is used and a sharp boundary results between the synthetic and real textures. In Figure 3c, a pure synthetic texture was first created using the original algorithm of <ref> [4] </ref>, and then was composited onto the original image using a binary mask. Though the border is alias-free through the use of multi-resolution composition, there is a sharp transition in the texture grain. In Figure 3d, a pure synthetic texture was composited onto the original image using a smooth mask.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Photographs and images often have regions which are in some sense flawed. At times, the flaw is due to a minute artifact: there may be scratches on the image, or perhaps a visible special effects wire. Fast interactive techniques exist for removing this type of smallscale noise <ref> [5] </ref>. At other times, the flaw is present in a large region of the image: there may be a stain on the photograph, or some unsightly object may be present in the scene.

Reference-contexts: Second, the compositing of the replacement region with the areas surrounding the stain may lead to visible boundaries even with the use of multi-resolution compositing techniques. We propose an approach that utilizes synthetic textures for image replacement. This approach, which was demonstrated by Malzbender and Spach <ref> [7] </ref> in a different algorithm, has several advantages. Since synthetic tex tures may be created with arbitrary size, repetition artifacts are avoided.
