Abstract: Retrieving relevant cases is a crucial component of case-based reasoning systems. The task is to use user-defined query to retrieve useful information, i.e., exact matches or partial matches which are close to query-defined request according to certain measures. The difficulty stems from the fact that it may not be easy (or it may be even impossible) to specify query requests precisely and completely resulting in a situation known as a fuzzy-querying. It is usually not a problem for small domains, but for a large repositories which store various information (multifunctional information bases or a federated databases), a request specification becomes a bottleneck. Thus, a flexible retrieval algorithm is required, allowing for imprecise query specification and for changing the viewpoint. Efficient database techniques exists for locating exact matches. Finding relevant partial matches might be a problem. This document proposes a context-based similarity as a basis for flexible retrieval. Historical bacground on research in similarity assessment is presented and is used as a motivation for formal definition of context-based similarity. We also describe a similarity-based retrieval system for multifunctinal information bases.

Reference-contexts: However, in the design domain (e.g., software reuse) it is hardly possible. This suggests that the system should be capable of flexibly changing the context and thus flexibly changing the rules under which relevant items are retrieved. In the HYPO-based tutoring system <ref> (Ashley and Aleven, 1991) </ref> the relevance concepts are explicitly represented. The system is used in teaching law students to argue with cases. In order to succeed in this task, the system needs to explain the concepts of relevance.

Reference-contexts: it is also represented in people's representation of the particular object or that it is an easily accessible property. 2.2.2 Deep Similarity According to (Medin and Ortony, 1989), deep similarity is based on more central, core properties of objects. 4 This is in line with the experimental results presented in <ref> (Brewer, 1989) </ref>. Ross observed that even though surface similarity is used more often, structural similarities are more successful in enabling the students to solve a new problem.

Reference-contexts: According to <ref> (Carnap, 1967) </ref> a resemblance relation is called a similarity relation if it is symmetrical and reflexive, and an equivalence if it is also transitive (see Section 3.3 for other opinions).

Reference-contexts: Vosniadou (Vosniadou, 1989) notices that relational properties of objects may be particularly salient even for young children. This shows not only that surface similarity can be salient, but that relational properties can also be easily accessible. Moreover, the salience of attributes may change over time. It was observed (see <ref> (Chi, Feltovich and Glaser, 1981) </ref>) that experts are able to perceive the underlying similarities in problems, whereas novices are not capable to see the same similarities mainly because the difference in surface attributes. A nice example showing this differences is presented in (Vosniadou, 1989).

Reference-contexts: The need for similarity in rule-based systems comes up from the existence of situations where there is no directly applicable knowledge. In such a case, the system may refer to similar concepts, propositions or situations if they occur in the same context. Following <ref> (Collins and Michalski, 1989) </ref>, it is suggested that similarity be implemented as rules since rule application and similarity matching need to be performed at the same time. <p> When retrieving items, we might want to consider all attributes used to describe them or only certain subsets of them (in different situations different subsets may be relevant). The problem of context in analogical reasoning was presented in <ref> (Collins and Burstein, 1989) </ref> as "an important test of any of these (analogical) computer models": [An important test] is whether they can select two different correspondence mappings from a source domain depending on what aspects of the source domain are relevant to the target domain.

Reference-contexts: According to (Medin and Ortony, 1989), surface similarity is based on readily accessible components of objects. A similar definition is presented in <ref> (Davies and Thomson, 1988, page 292) </ref>, where an euphoric similarity is defined as a similarity of the perceptual or conceptual characteristics of an item and the characteristics of some memory representation. <p> Here, context might be required to change because user needs changed or because repository evolved. 2.5.3 Harmful Context Even though we presented several reasons why and when context is helpful in problem solving, there are also situation when the use of context may result in misperception. In <ref> (Davies and Thomson, 1988, page 294-5) </ref>, several psychological experiments are described. It was observed, that when a new person was introduced in a previously seen context, the false recognition was increased. <p> Because of the harmful effect of the context in some situations, it is sometimes required to use the process of decontextualization <ref> (Davies and Thomson, 1988) </ref>. The need for this process is apparent from the existence of two kinds of memory: 1. episodic memory is based upon memories of specific experience; and 2. semantic memory is primarily abstract knowledge. Abstract knowledge is derived from the specific experience via decontextualization.

Reference-contexts: James (James, 1890) proposes that two things are resembling each other because of the absolute identity in respects to some attribute or attributes, combined with the absolute identity of the rest of their being. His views are useful when one considers similarity in context (see Section 2.5). Goodman <ref> (Goodman, 1951) </ref> considers similarity as a four-place predicate, noting the non-transitivity of similarity matches.

Reference-contexts: Retrieving of useful information is accomplished as follows: * by attention focusing on relevant parts of knowledge; * by locating both exact matches and similar items. There is little commonalities between definitions of relevance used in different systems <ref> (Greiner, 1994) </ref>. The most common ground is reached when relevance is defined as something useful. Our definition of relevance is as follows: Definition 2.4 (Relevance) Retrieved items are considered relevant if they are similar to the query with respect to current context.

Reference-contexts: The second level compares attribute data types and properties. Based on similarity score obtained from matching object attributes, the similarity between objects is computed. An expert diagnostic system FIXIT <ref> (Hart and Graham, 1994) </ref> is related to our work by its consideration of context. The system has two parts a diagnostic system and a retrieval tool.

Reference-contexts: Factors are used during retrieval since they make cases stronger or weaker for plaintiff. The relevance concepts are used to interpret student responses, to generate feedback and to explain the reasoning process. In the Clavier system <ref> (Hennessy and Hinkle, 1992) </ref> it was noted that the context information is critical during problem solving. However, the case representation in Clavier was not sufficient to provide reliable suggestions and the system left the final decision to a human operator. Better context handling could improve the system's reliability.

Reference-contexts: Ross observed that even though surface similarity is used more often, structural similarities are more successful in enabling the students to solve a new problem. Gentner (Gentner, 1983; Gentner, 1989) considers deep similarity as structural similarity, similarity based on the relational structure (two-or-more-place predicates characterizing relations). <ref> (Holyoak and Thagard, 1989) </ref> propose that what constitutes structural similarity are the identities that influence goal attainment. Vosniadou (Vosniadou, 1989) notices that relational properties of objects may be particularly salient even for young children. <p> The reason presented is than intra-domain analogies are similar in many simple, descriptive, and non-relational properties, in contrast to inter-domain analogies, where relational properties play a central role. According to <ref> (Holyoak and Thagard, 1989) </ref>, even though both structural and surface similarities have comparable effects on spontaneous analogical transfer, only the former has a significant impact on total analogical transfer once a hint was provided.

Reference-contexts: This partial history of similarity theories is used as a motivation for a novel theory of similarity context-based similarity proposed in later sections. 2.1 Philosophical Background Similarity was first studied by philosophers <ref> (Hume, 1947) </ref>. 1 David Hume foresaw that if objects are similar in appearance then they will be attended with similar effects; thus, from causes which appear similar we expect similar effects. 2 Hume (Hume, 1947) considers surface similarity (see Section 2.2.1) to be the only existing similarity. <p> of similarity context-based similarity proposed in later sections. 2.1 Philosophical Background Similarity was first studied by philosophers <ref> (Hume, 1947) </ref>. 1 David Hume foresaw that if objects are similar in appearance then they will be attended with similar effects; thus, from causes which appear similar we expect similar effects. 2 Hume (Hume, 1947) considers surface similarity (see Section 2.2.1) to be the only existing similarity. <p> The reasons for definition of this kind of similarity come from the criticism of Hume's work on resemblance <ref> (Hume, 1947) </ref>. Wallach pointed out two main reasons why Hume's views on similarity are limited: 1. failure to note the full range of attributes in terms of which objects and events can be grouped; and 2. failure to separate potential similarity from psychological similarity. <p> On the other hand, a particular attribute may be lacking and yet the items may be judged similar. In (Wallach, 1958), four different definitions of psychological similarity are presented: 5 1. Psychological similarity defined in terms of common environmental properties <ref> (Hume, 1947) </ref>: In this situation, one can change the similarity by varying the common values of attributes. 2.

Reference-contexts: Even though dissimilarity (as a measure of irrelevance) is not symmetric in general (Subramanian and Genesereth, 1987), our approach allows for determining the circumstances where dissimilarity is symmetric. Moreover, it has been shown that dissimilarity is not reflexive, is not transitive, and is monotonic <ref> (Jurisica and Lauzon, 1994) </ref>. 13 Another motivation for context to be used as a part of similarity is that context usually changes for different situations or when a different view is used (Acker and Porter, 1992; Kashyap and Sheth, 1993) (see also Section 3). <p> In <ref> (Jurisica and Lauzon, 1994) </ref> we present a more detailed analysis of similarity. Previous similarity theories are discussed and compared. We characterize existing kinds of similarity.

Reference-contexts: The former one is a general notion of similarity in analysis and the latter one is a specific variant of the former one, being tied to the goals and preconditions according to the derivational trace of the solution. Kashyap and Sheth <ref> (Kashyap and Sheth, 1993) </ref> present an approach to resolve schematic differences among semantically related objects in multi-database systems. They define semantic proximity as an attempt to characterize the degree of semantic similarity between two objects using the real world semantics.

Reference-contexts: To accomplish this, we define context-based similarity, where context is a set of attributes with associated constraints on the attribute values. Context allows us to specify how the matching should be performed giving us local-based matching criteria <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>. 1.1 Tasks to be Addressed by a Context-Based Similarity Real world problems require different tasks to be applied during a problem solving process. We show how context-based similarity can be applied in various situations. The tasks to be addressed by a context-based similarity are as follows: 1. <p> One possibility to overcome this drawback is to use multiple (or local) contexts <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>. The problem of similarity has also been studied for spatial databases (Jagadish, 1991). This author proposes an organization for a database of objects that permits an efficient retrieval of objects with a shape similar to an input shape. <p> Similarity relations among items are predefined. According to our definition of similarity (see Definition 3.4 in Section 3), this approach can be characterized as a limited similarity in retrieval since the context is fixed or only a limited flexibility is allowed. In <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref> a similar approach is called global since all cases are retrieved and ranked based on a global matching strategy. 2. Similar items are located by defining similarity relations at query time, allowing for flexibly changing context and criteria for matching. Such relations are defined as similarity in retrieval. <p> Similarity in retrieval is used when the context is specified and the task is to retrieve all relevant items from the information base; thus, an information base and a context is input and a set of items is an output. This approach is similar to the local matching criteria <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref> since several possible strategies can be used for matching. The difference is that most of the previous approaches 9 use numerical measures of similarity and thus a semantic explanation of similarity may not be available.

Reference-contexts: Even though dissimilarity (as a measure of irrelevance) is not symmetric in general (Subramanian and Genesereth, 1987), our approach allows for determining the circumstances where dissimilarity is symmetric. Moreover, it has been shown that dissimilarity is not reflexive, is not transitive, and is monotonic <ref> (Jurisica and Lauzon, 1994) </ref>. 13 Another motivation for context to be used as a part of similarity is that context usually changes for different situations or when a different view is used (Acker and Porter, 1992; Kashyap and Sheth, 1993) (see also Section 3). <p> In <ref> (Jurisica and Lauzon, 1994) </ref> we present a more detailed analysis of similarity. Previous similarity theories are discussed and compared. We characterize existing kinds of similarity.

Reference-contexts: However, the case representation in Clavier was not sufficient to provide reliable suggestions and the system left the final decision to a human operator. Better context handling could improve the system's reliability. The CAReT system <ref> (Lee and Harandi, 1993) </ref> is similar to our work in the sense that it supports flexible retrieval of software components. CEReT is an analogy-based retrieval system applied to software design reuse. It also supports incomplete query specification as well as similar and exact matching of components.

Reference-contexts: The motivation for considering context is its ability to bring additional knowledge to the reasoning process and thus focus attention on relevant details <ref> (Light and Butterworth, 1993) </ref>. When retrieving items, we might want to consider all attributes used to describe them or only certain subsets of them (in different situations different subsets may be relevant).

Reference-contexts: The system is used in teaching law students to argue with cases. In order to succeed in this task, the system needs to explain the concepts of relevance. Relevant similarities and differences among cases are represented as logical expressions called factors using a knowledge representation language Loom <ref> (MacGregor, 1988) </ref>. Factors are used during retrieval since they make cases stronger or weaker for plaintiff. The relevance concepts are used to interpret student responses, to generate feedback and to explain the reasoning process.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted, however, that the distinction between surface and deep similarity is not clear cut; what is surface similarity in one context (or in one domain) can easily be deep similarity in another context (or in another domain). Moreover, according to <ref> (Medin and Ortony, 1989) </ref>, there is a causal relation between deep and surface similarities; the former one constrains and sometimes even generates the later one. There is another problematic issue objects can be described by different set of attributes. <p> According to <ref> (Medin and Ortony, 1989) </ref>, surface similarity is based on readily accessible components of objects. <p> It is also noted (see (Vosniadou, 1989)) that even though a property can be described as an object attribute, it does not necessarily mean that it is also represented in people's representation of the particular object or that it is an easily accessible property. 2.2.2 Deep Similarity According to <ref> (Medin and Ortony, 1989) </ref>, deep similarity is based on more central, core properties of objects. 4 This is in line with the experimental results presented in (Brewer, 1989). <p> As for the connection between surface and deep similarities, it is claimed in <ref> (Medin and Ortony, 1989) </ref> that the surface similarity serves as a heuristic for where to look for deeper attributes. <p> Context is used as a mechanism to filter out all irrelevant pieces of information and to specify the criteria for matching. Similarity judgments are made with respect to representations of entities, not with respect to the entities themselves <ref> (Medin and Ortony, 1989) </ref>. Thus, having a changeable representation (i.e., having an option to add and remove attributes of an object representation flexibly), one can make any two items similar according to some criteria (see Example 3.1).

Reference-contexts: The flexible mechanism will allow for attention focusing and for changing similarity measure by including context in the similarity definition. * It is possible to diminish the difference between similarity in object attributes and similarity in object relations by using a special representation language, as suggested in <ref> (Mylopoulos et al., 1990) </ref>. Here, relations and objects are treated equally. * As will be shown in latter sections (see Section 4.1) context-based similarity has two levels. The first level an equivalence of items can be called a surface similarity.

Reference-contexts: Hume's views (see Section 2.1) are limited when considered deeply. The reasons for the failure of his definition of similarity are presented in (Wallach, 1958). Wallach's work is considered to be the first modern study of similarity. Tversky <ref> (Tversky, 1977) </ref> presents several examples where he describes features of similarity. However, his formalism does not allow him to express all of them (e.g., context) which resulted in the invalidation of symmetry and transitivity theorems. <p> Context also allows for excluding irrelevant information. This feature is particularly important in unusual situations where similarity may be affected by "usual" context, e.g., context in which the items appear most of the time. 2.5.1 Context Dependency Tversky <ref> (Tversky, 1977) </ref> discussed dependency of similarity on context and frame of reference, however, his formalism did not capture this dependency. Tversky did not consider changed or implicitly-assumed context as a phenomenon affecting similarity judgment.

Reference-contexts: In (Rips, 1989) surface similarity is called perceptual similarity and is defined as cognitively primitive and well defined. It is argued that because of these features of perceptual similarity, it can be used as a construct to explain other psychological functions (e.g., categorization). Vosniadou <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>, suggests using salient similarity instead of surface similarity to refer to similarity grounded in easily retrievable aspects of representations. It does not need to be descriptive attributes. Rather, it can be similarity in relational or conceptual attributes, as long as these attributes are easily accessible. <p> Salient similarity allows for retrieval of inter-domain analogies. She also suggests that the surface/deep similarity distinction is a dynamic one because over time the representations may change and thus may change the salience of attributes. It is also noted (see <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>) that even though a property can be described as an object attribute, it does not necessarily mean that it is also represented in people's representation of the particular object or that it is an easily accessible property. 2.2.2 Deep Similarity According to (Medin and Ortony, 1989), deep similarity is <p> Gentner (Gentner, 1983; Gentner, 1989) considers deep similarity as structural similarity, similarity based on the relational structure (two-or-more-place predicates characterizing relations). (Holyoak and Thagard, 1989) propose that what constitutes structural similarity are the identities that influence goal attainment. Vosniadou <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref> notices that relational properties of objects may be particularly salient even for young children. This shows not only that surface similarity can be salient, but that relational properties can also be easily accessible. Moreover, the salience of attributes may change over time. <p> It was observed (see (Chi, Feltovich and Glaser, 1981)) that experts are able to perceive the underlying similarities in problems, whereas novices are not capable to see the same similarities mainly because the difference in surface attributes. A nice example showing this differences is presented in <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>. <p> The basic classification of analogies is based on the distinction between intra-domain analogies and inter-domain analogies. It was observed that for these two types of analogical reasoning different similarity assessments should be deployed. According to <ref> (Vosniadou and Ortony, 1989) </ref>, for intra-domain analogies, the likehood of retrieving an analog increases when the surface similarity between the source and the target is increased. For inter-domain analogies, the retrieval of analogs can be based on salient similarity. <p> However, because inter-domain analogies do not share similarity in surface attributes, they can be accessed only through similarity in their relational attributes. This also explains the difficulty to use inter-domain analogies since people are more sensitive to similarity in descriptive properties than to similarity in structural aspects <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>. It is believed (see (Vosniadou and Ortony, 1989)) that surface similarity may often enhance the probability of using analogical reminding by helping to notice that problems belong to the same problem type. <p> This also explains the difficulty to use inter-domain analogies since people are more sensitive to similarity in descriptive properties than to similarity in structural aspects (Vosniadou, 1989). It is believed (see <ref> (Vosniadou and Ortony, 1989) </ref>) that surface similarity may often enhance the probability of using analogical reminding by helping to notice that problems belong to the same problem type. Similarity in salient attributes between the source and the target can lead to discovery of a productive analogy (Vosniadou, 1989). <p> Similarity in salient attributes between the source and the target can lead to discovery of a productive analogy <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>. According to (Ross, 1989; Vosniadou, 1989; Spiro et al., 1989), reasoning by similarity and analogy itself can make the knowledge base more flexible and facilitate the learning of general rules and the acquisition of new schemata; thus, analogical reasoning allows for restructuring the knowledge base. <p> However, reasoning by analogy may fail if the representational structures on which the analogical mechanism operates is not appropriate <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>. Even though the analogical mapping may not require the presence of the underlying structure in the target domain (see (Vosniadou, 1989)), it is required that enough is known about the target domain to make such a mapping feasible. 7 2.2.5 Conclusions and Motivation From the presented review of literature <p> However, reasoning by analogy may fail if the representational structures on which the analogical mechanism operates is not appropriate <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>.

(Holyoak and Thagard, 1989) propose that what constitutes structural similarity are the identities that influence goal attainment. Vosniadou <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref> notices that relational properties of objects may be particularly salient even for young children. This shows not only that surface similarity can be salient, but that relational properties can also be easily accessible. Moreover, the salience of attributes may change over time. <p> It was observed (see (Chi, Feltovich and Glaser, 1981)) that experts are able to perceive the underlying similarities in problems, whereas novices are not capable to see the same similarities mainly because the difference in surface attributes. A nice example showing this differences is presented in <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>. <p> The basic classification of analogies is based on the distinction between intra-domain analogies and inter-domain analogies. It was observed that for these two types of analogical reasoning different similarity assessments should be deployed. According to <ref> (Vosniadou and Ortony, 1989) </ref>, for intra-domain analogies, the likehood of retrieving an analog increases when the surface similarity between the source and the target is increased. For inter-domain analogies, the retrieval of analogs can be based on salient similarity. <p> However, because inter-domain analogies do not share similarity in surface attributes, they can be accessed only through similarity in their relational attributes. This also explains the difficulty to use inter-domain analogies since people are more sensitive to similarity in descriptive properties than to similarity in structural aspects <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>. It is believed (see (Vosniadou and Ortony, 1989)) that surface similarity may often enhance the probability of using analogical reminding by helping to notice that problems belong to the same problem type. <p> This also explains the difficulty to use inter-domain analogies since people are more sensitive to similarity in descriptive properties than to similarity in structural aspects (Vosniadou, 1989). It is believed (see <ref> (Vosniadou and Ortony, 1989) </ref>) that surface similarity may often enhance the probability of using analogical reminding by helping to notice that problems belong to the same problem type. Similarity in salient attributes between the source and the target can lead to discovery of a productive analogy (Vosniadou, 1989). <p> Similarity in salient attributes between the source and the target can lead to discovery of a productive analogy <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>. According to (Ross, 1989; Vosniadou, 1989; Spiro et al., 1989), reasoning by similarity and analogy itself can make the knowledge base more flexible and facilitate the learning of general rules and the acquisition of new schemata; thus, analogical reasoning allows for restructuring the knowledge base. <p> However, reasoning by analogy may fail if the representational structures on which the analogical mechanism operates is not appropriate <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>. Even though the analogical mapping may not require the presence of the underlying structure in the target domain (see (Vosniadou, 1989)), it is required that enough is known about the target domain to make such a mapping feasible. 7 2.2.5 Conclusions and Motivation From the presented review of literature <p> However, reasoning by analogy may fail if the representational structures on which the analogical mechanism operates is not appropriate <ref> (Vosniadou, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: According to him, the degree of similarity of two composite ideas depends on the number of simple ideas they have in common. However, Hume assumed that the similarity between simple ideas is given to us directly. The reasons for the failure of this definitions are presented in <ref> (Wallach, 1958) </ref>. Wallach's work is considered to be the first modern study of similarity (see Section 2.2). Hume also observed, that all arguments from experience are founded on the similarity which we discover among natural objects. <p> In this section, we briefly review some of the more relevant literature in this area. Hume's views (see Section 2.1) are limited when considered deeply. The reasons for the failure of his definition of similarity are presented in <ref> (Wallach, 1958) </ref>. Wallach's work is considered to be the first modern study of similarity. Tversky (Tversky, 1977) presents several examples where he describes features of similarity. However, his formalism does not allow him to express all of them (e.g., context) which resulted in the invalidation of symmetry and transitivity theorems. <p> In the next sections we present useful measurements of similarities which have shown to be of interest to the research community. 3 According to Tversky, similarity = 1 dissimilarity. 4 2.2.1 Surface Similarity Wallach <ref> (Wallach, 1958) </ref> in his effort to revise the earlier work by Hume (see Section 2.1) defines potential similarity as the measure of the number of common environmental features that two objects or events are found to display. <p> Another use of surface similarity for deep attributes is to constraint on the predicates that compose the mental representation. 2.2.3 Psychological Similarity The first modern study of psychological similarity is presented in <ref> (Wallach, 1958) </ref>. The reasons for definition of this kind of similarity come from the criticism of Hume's work on resemblance (Hume, 1947). <p> On the one hand, a particular attribute may be present and yet the similarity judgment may not be made. On the other hand, a particular attribute may be lacking and yet the items may be judged similar. In <ref> (Wallach, 1958) </ref>, four different definitions of psychological similarity are presented: 5 1. Psychological similarity defined in terms of common environmental properties (Hume, 1947): In this situation, one can change the similarity by varying the common values of attributes. 2.
