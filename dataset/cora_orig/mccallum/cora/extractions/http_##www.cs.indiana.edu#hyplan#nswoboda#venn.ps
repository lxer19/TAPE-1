Title: Implementing Euler/Venn Reasoning Systems

Abstract: This paper proposes an implementation of a Eu-ler/Venn reasoning system using directed acyclic graphs and shows that this implementation is correct with respect to a modified Shin/Hammer mathematical model of Euler/Venn Reasoning. In proving its correctness it will also be shown that the proposed implementation preserves or inherits the soundness and completeness properties of the mathematical model of the Euler/Venn system.

Reference-contexts: system if there is a translation or mapping between them that preserves deductive and semantic relations. 2 A DAG is a Directed Acyclic Graph. to be a traditional Venn system with Euler like extensions (see below.) While this treatment was inspired by and is quite similar to that found in <ref> (Hammer 1995) </ref>, there are a number of important differences that should be noted, the most important of which include that the grammar presented here adds more well-formed diagrams, and that the system's semantics have been changed to accommodate these new diagrams. <p> of any closed curve C with unique label N completely within the rectangle of V so that the regions intersected by C are split into at most two new regions, is a member of V EV F . 3 3 This grammatical stipulation while more general than that used in <ref> (Hammer 1995) </ref> is still not as general as one (b) V with the addition of a n of a new n within any region of a closed curve of V is a member of V EV F . (c) V with the shading of any enclosed region is a member of <p> Formally this assignment is the pair (U; f ) where U is the domain and f is a function associating a subset of U with each basic region. Basic regions of the same label are assigned the same subset of U by f . Proposition 1 (Hammer <ref> (Hammer 1995) </ref>) If (U; f ) is an assignment of U to basic regions then there is a unique set assignment (U; g) to minimal regions (where g is a function assigning subsets of U to the minimal regions of the diagram with minimal regions not existing in the diagram being <p> This is written as V j= EV F V . Soundness and Completeness of EV F Theorem 1 Soundness of EV F (Extension of Hammer <ref> (Hammer 1995) </ref>) For every set of diagrams V [ fV g, if V ` EV F V then V j= EV F V . <p> Thus since the removed minimal region does not exist in the diagram then I (r) = ;, and (U; I) j= EV F V 0 . Theorem 2 Completeness of EV F (Extension of Hammer <ref> (Hammer 1995) </ref>) For every set of diagrams V [ fV g, if V j= EV F V then V ` EV F V . Proof Sketch: For this proof, Hammer's completeness proof found in (Hammer 1995) will again be greatly relied upon. <p> Theorem 2 Completeness of EV F (Extension of Hammer <ref> (Hammer 1995) </ref>) For every set of diagrams V [ fV g, if V j= EV F V then V ` EV F V . Proof Sketch: For this proof, Hammer's completeness proof found in (Hammer 1995) will again be greatly relied upon. First all diagrams in V are extended to Venn diagrams and put into the set V 0 , through the repeated application of the Adding shaded regions inference rule. The same is done to V extending it to V 0 .
