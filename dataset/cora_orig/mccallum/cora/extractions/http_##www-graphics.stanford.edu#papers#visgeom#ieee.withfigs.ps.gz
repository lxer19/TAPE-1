Reference-contexts: At the University of North Carolina/Chapel Hill, the Fourphront system by David Banks is another interactive system for the study of surfaces in 4D <ref> [1] </ref>. This system, which runs 4 on the high-speed massively parallel Pixel-Planes 5 graphics engine, provides user control of transparency, depth cueing, intersection highlights, and 2-sided paint as well as supporting user control of rotation and translation.

Reference-contexts: Here we take note of some of the specific software systems being used in minimal surface research. One tactic for generating minimal surfaces is to evolve a given initial surface to minimize energy, such as surface tension. Ken Brakke's Surface Evolver <ref> [2] </ref> is an interactive program that evolves a surface toward minimal energy by a gradient descent method. The energy in 9 the Evolver can be a combination of factors such as surface tension, gravitational energy, squared mean curvature, user-defined surface integrals, or knot energies. <p> The "interactive book" approach of situating interactive graphics within a written context is an appealing educational paradigm. Geomview [9] and the Surface Evolver <ref> [2] </ref> can be widely distributed because of their generality, extensibility, and portability; they were designed to accommodate user-defined tasks not built into the original system.

Reference-contexts: In [5, 4], Hanson, Pheng, and Cross introduce "outside viewer" techniques that allow interaction with 4D-lit, thickened 2-manifolds as well as moderately complex tessellated 3-manifolds. Charlie Gunn's imaging system, Maniview <ref> [3] </ref>, an external module of Geomview, takes an alternative approach that dates to Bernard Riemann, the founder of manifold theory. The viewer is placed inside the 3-manifold, with no notion of an embedding in some ambient, higher-dimensional space. <p> In all cases, however, the standard built-in illumination computations are implicitly Eu-clidean; correct rendering of surface shading requires custom software shaders that use alternative inner products for computing distances and angles in non-Euclidean geometry. Such shaders have been implemented and shown in <ref> [3] </ref> to impose only moderate performance penalties in comparison to the built-in Euclidean ones. Such interactive tools for the exploration of non-Euclidean spaces show clearly how computer graphics can allow humans to experience worlds that otherwise would not be accessible.

Reference-contexts: This is harder for 3-manifolds, but still feasible if one can do rapid volume rendering. In essence, one projects from 4D to 3D, treating space as a photosensitive medium that one can also fly through. In <ref> [5, 4] </ref>, Hanson, Pheng, and Cross introduce "outside viewer" techniques that allow interaction with 4D-lit, thickened 2-manifolds as well as moderately complex tessellated 3-manifolds. Charlie Gunn's imaging system, Maniview [3], an external module of Geomview, takes an alternative approach that dates to Bernard Riemann, the founder of manifold theory. <p> The 4D depth buffer in principle produces precisely the same type of characteristic occlusion cues that 3D rendering produces for tubes. However, the full method using volume imaging, 4D occlusion calculations, and a final volume rendering step is very time consuming. In <ref> [4] </ref>, Hanson and Cross introduce new techniques that are fast enough to use for interactive 4D visualization in virtual reality environments. <p> To avoid breaking visual concentration, illiView avoids popup menus and control panels. Numerical and the status information can be incorporated into a heads-up display in the single window. The Indiana University 4D lighting software system <ref> [4] </ref> illustrates another contrasting approach. Here a particular piece of high performance hardware (the SGI Reality Engine) is chosen and is exploited to achieve unusual effects for unique applications.

Reference-contexts: The reader need only consult such classic works as Anschauliche Geometrie by Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen to see the influence of this visual approach to mathematics; it is worth noting that the English translation <ref> [6] </ref>, Geometry and the Imagination, of the German title only barely does justice to the complex nuances of the German anschaulich, which involves other connotations, including "vivid," "graphic," "intuitive," "demonstratable," "perceivable in the mind's eye," or perhaps visualizable: hence our choice of the phrase Visualizable Geometry in the title of this

Reference-contexts: This truly excited the minimal surface community and piqued their interest in computer graphics. In Figure 10, we show new surfaces recently given by Hoff-man, Wei, and Karcher <ref> [7] </ref>; the one-hole surface is the first complete, properly embedded minimal surface of finite topology and infinite total curvature to be found since the discovery of the helicoid in the eighteenth century.

Reference-contexts: The Center has served as a focal point for a number of efforts in mathematical visualization; a widely used system distributed by the Geometry Center is Geomview <ref> [9] </ref>, a very general surface viewer developed by Stuart Levy, Tamara Munzner, and Mark Phillips. Its built-in functionality can be extended by customized user programs, called external modules. <p> A typical example permits the user to "fly" on a curve in 3-space, keeping track of all the differential geometry (e.g., curvature and torsion) continuously as the curve is traversed. The "interactive book" approach of situating interactive graphics within a written context is an appealing educational paradigm. Geomview <ref> [9] </ref> and the Surface Evolver [2] can be widely distributed because of their generality, extensibility, and portability; they were designed to accommodate user-defined tasks not built into the original system.

Reference-contexts: Cayley's construction is in fact ideal for programming interactive navigations of nonEuclidean geometries <ref> [10] </ref>. Many manifolds are naturally suited for hyperbolic or spherical, rather than Euclidean, geometry. Although the formulas for computing distance and angles in these geometries differ from Euclidean geometry, they can be built into mathematical visualization systems by hand. <p> The projective models of non-Euclidean geometry can be represented by 4 fi 4 real matrix transformations on homogeneous coordinates that are serendipitously supported by today's computer graphics transformation hardware and software <ref> [10] </ref>. The conformal model, however, cannot be implemented using 4 fi 4 real matrices, so standard computer graphics hardware does not suffice.
