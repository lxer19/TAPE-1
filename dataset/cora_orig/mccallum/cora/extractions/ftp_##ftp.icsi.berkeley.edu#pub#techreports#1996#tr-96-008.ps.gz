Abstract: This paper contains a short proof of a formula by Frame, Robinson, and Thrall [1] which counts the number of Young tableaux of a given shape. The proof is based on a simple but novel geometric way of expressing the area of a Ferrers diagram.

Reference-contexts: Define the hook length h i;j to be the number of cells in H i;j . (See Figure 1.) Theorem 1 (Frame-Robinson-Thrall <ref> [1] </ref>). If is a partition of n, then f () = Q ; where the product is over all cells in the Ferrers diagram of .

Reference-contexts: If is a partition of n, then f () = Q ; where the product is over all cells in the Ferrers diagram of .

We explain the process with respect to a staircase of shape (ff; fi) with area a (ff; fi), and retain the notation of the previous section.
