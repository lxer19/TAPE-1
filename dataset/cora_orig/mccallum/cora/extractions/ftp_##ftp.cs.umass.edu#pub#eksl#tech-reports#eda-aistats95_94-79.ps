Abstract: This paper gives an overview of the design of aide, the Assistant for Intelligent Data Exploration, which assists humans in the early stages of data analysis. The system adopts a script-based planning approach to automating EDA. Data-directed mechanisms extract simple observations and suggestive indications from the data. Scripted EDA operations are then applied in goal-directed fashion to generate deeper descriptions of the data. Control rules guide the operations, relying on intermediate results for their decisions. The system is mixed-initiative, capable of autonomously pursuing high and low level goals while still allowing the user to guide or override its decisions. The discussion covers representation of data, design of EDA operations, and issues in control.

Reference-contexts: When a system relies on statistical tests for its reasoning, exploration can comes into play to ensure that assumptions of the tests are not violated (e.g., linearity for partial correlations <ref> [2] </ref>.) Central to aide is the opportunistic, incremental approach to discovery described by Tukey, Mosteller, and other advocates of EDA.

Reference-contexts: Guidance is provided by control scripts which allow combinations of scripts beyond sequencing, and by two complementary mechanisms: indications and intentions. The extended scripting language is based on work in knowledge-based signal processing <ref> [5] </ref>. A control script extends sequential scripts in several ways. Control scripts contain constructs that allow sequencing, iteration, mapping, and conditionalizing of both actions and subgoals. A script tests its input variables with a set of constraints, using a simple extension of pattern matching. <p> Focusing heuristics act in this role <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There are some obvious difficulties with the approach: maintaining consistency in an incrementally growing set of descriptions can be difficult; in many cases local techniques can miss simple global patterns <ref> [8] </ref>; local techniques can lead to a plethora of spurious results [22]; the problem of scaling in cluster analysis is notoriously difficult.

Reference-contexts: These regularities are captured in a general form in the representation presented here. Other issues in the related area of knowledge discovery in databases [17] are relevant as well. Causal modeling systems, especially systems such as TETRAD <ref> [12, 9] </ref>, offer yet another perspective on data exploration. Much of the external knowledge brought to bear in exploring experimental data is in the form of causal relationships: y is a dependent variable, and cannot cause variation in x; the correlation between z and w is due to sampling bias.

Reference-contexts: On completion of this search path (i.e., when the "handle" goal becomes satisfied) the focusing heuristic is reactivated to decide whether the other partitioning should be considered as well. EDA processing shows strong similarities to the kind of processing common in blackboard-based interpretation systems that perform signal interpretation <ref> [15] </ref>. Such systems merge diverse sources of information by means of evidence aggregation and differential diagnosis. They can furthermore often take advantage of hierarchical decompositions of domain concepts. A speech understanding system such as Hearsay, for example, combines elements at the word level to produce structures at the phrase level.

Reference-contexts: Gale and Pregibon's REX system, for example, implemented a strategy for linear regression [11]. Oldford and Peters implemented a complex strategy for collinearity analysis [21]. The goals of aide bear a resemblance to those of Lubinsky and Pregi-bon's TESS <ref> [16] </ref>, which supports analysis by accommodating user knowledge of context in a search good descriptions of data. aide extends this work by supplying an appropriate taxonomy for EDA operations and using this taxonomy to guide search at different levels of abstraction. 8 In machine learning there have been several broad approaches

Reference-contexts: A more complete analysis is given in a report under preparation. This description, though brief, should give the flavor of the analysis. To summarize, we begin with initial descriptions of the data, such as the observation of gaps between adjacent values. From these we generate indications <ref> [19] </ref>, or suggestive characteristics: the data fall into clusters. Based on these indications we apply specific EDA procedures: we break the data down and analyze the clusters individually. These procedures may involve iterative refinement, as with the alternative descriptions of clusters in S.

Reference-contexts: The search space grows explosively. While research in statistics and artificial intelligence has addressed issues in the automation of later stages of analysis, such as theory generation, model selection, and experiment design <ref> [23] </ref>, less attention has been given to initial exploration of data. We have developed a novel approach to exploration as search.

Reference-contexts: Exploratory results give rise to confirmatory studies in a cycle of successively more refined exploration and confirmation [7, 13]. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) provides a wide range of statistical tools for the early stages of analysis <ref> [26] </ref>. Simple exploratory results include histograms that describe discrete and continuous variables, schematic plots that give general characterizations of relationships, partitions of relationships that distinguish different modes of behavior, functional simplification of low-dimensionality relationships, and two-way tables such as contingency tables. <p> So we shall always be glad (a) to simplify description and (b) to describe one layer deeper <ref> [26] </ref>. Our design revolves around an understanding of the EDA process as the iterative application of four classes of operations: operations for descriptive handling, simplification, extension, and deepening. Handling operations produce descriptions of data.
