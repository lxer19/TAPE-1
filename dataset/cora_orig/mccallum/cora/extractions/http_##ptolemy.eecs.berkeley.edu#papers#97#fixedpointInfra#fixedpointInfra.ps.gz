Title: An Infrastructure for Numeric Precision Control in the Ptolemy Environment

Abstract: An abstract algorithm specification with idealized arithmetic must be made concrete with realistic arithmetic in the final phase of the "algorithm-to-implementation" design process in order to assess power consumption, hardware cost, and execution speed. In this paper, an infrastructure for refining an idealized model to get an architecture-dependent specification with finite precision is introduced. This infrastructure is built on top of the Ptolemy environment.
