Abstract: In the multiparty communication game introduced by Chandra, Furst, and Lipton (1983), k players wish to evaluate collaboratively a function f(x 0 ; : : :; x k1 ) for which player i sees all inputs except x i : The players have unlimited computational power. The objective is to minimize the amount of communication. We consider a restricted version of the multiparty communication game which we call the simultaneous messages model. The difference is that in this model, each of the k players simultaneously sends a message to a referee, who sees none of the input. The referee then announces the function value. We show that there is an exponential gap between the Simultaneous Messages and the Communication models for up to (log n) 1* players, for any * &gt; 0: The separation is obtained by comparing the respective complexities of the generalized addressing function (GAF k ) in each model.

Reference-contexts: The multiparty communication complexity of f , denoted C (f ); is the minimum cost of a protocol computing f: Fairly strong multiparty communication complexity lower bounds of the form n=c k are obtained by Babai, Nisan, and Szegedy <ref> [BNS92] </ref> for families of explicit functions. However, it seems that those methods do not extend to logarithmic number of players and beyond.

Reference-contexts: However, it seems that those methods do not extend to logarithmic number of players and beyond. On the other hand, Yao has shown [Yao90] (cf Beigel-Tarui <ref> [BT91] </ref>) that lower bounds for an explicit function with super-polylogarithmic number of players would separate ACC from whatever class we take the target function. <p> Remark. Using Yao's reduction [Yao90] for the separation of ACC would require a distributional complexity lower bound for super-polylogarithmic number of players in the simultaneous messages model. The strenghtening of Yao's result by Beigel and Tarui <ref> [BT91] </ref> eliminates the need for distributional complexity lower bounds for this problem. Below we demonstrate that the extension of our lower bounds to distributional complexity, a seemingly much stronger result, requires little extra effort.

Reference-contexts: The trivial protocol uses n bits; the best upper bound we know of for 3 players uses n c log 2 n bits <ref> [Sz94] </ref>. However, we believe the correct order of magnitude should be closer to p Proof of Theorem 2.3: Let P be a protocol computing GAF k .
