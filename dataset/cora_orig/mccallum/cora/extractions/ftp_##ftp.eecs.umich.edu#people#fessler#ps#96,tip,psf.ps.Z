Abstract: This paper examines the spatial resolution properties of penalized-likelihood image reconstruction methods by analyzing the local impulse response. The analysis shows that standard regularization penalties induce space-variant local impulse response functions, even for space-invariant tomographic systems. Paradoxically, for emission image reconstruction the local resolution is generally poorest in high-count regions. We show that the linearized local impulse response induced by quadratic roughness penalties depends on the object only through its projections. This analysis leads naturally to a modified regularization penalty that yields reconstructed images with nearly uniform resolution. The modified penalty also provides a very practical method for choosing the regularization parameter to obtain a specified resolution in images reconstructed by penalized-likelihood methods.

Reference-contexts: Penalized-likelihood estimators are always biased, so local impulse responses will typically be bump-like functions, rather than the ideal impulse e j (e.g. Fig. 1). As a specific example, consider the penalized weighted least-squares estimator <ref> [21] </ref>: ^ = ^ (y) = arg min (y A) 0 W (y A) + fi 0 R; where W and R are symmetric nonnegative definite matrices for which the null spaces of R and WA are disjoint. <p> In principle one could "avoid" this problem altogether by using an unweighted least-squares estimator. We have shown qualitatively in <ref> [21] </ref> that nonuniform weighting is essential to achieve the desirable noise properties of statistical methods. In [31], we provide additional analyses and quantitative results that demonstrate the importance of weighting.

Reference-contexts: To illustrate this method, Fig. 1 shows a profile through several local impulse response functions of FBP and of the emission ML-EM algorithm [39] (stopped at 30 iterations, well before convergence). The object was a uniform ellipse of activity within a uniform elliptical attenuator (see <ref> [31] </ref> for details). Despite the fact that the elliptical object has uniform activity, the resolution of the nonlinear ML-EM estimator is clearly nonuniform, whereas the FBP resolution is uniform since the smoothing provided by the Hanning window is space-invariant. <p> In both cases the assumed log likelihood has the form: L (; y) = i neglecting constants independent of .

IV. Resolution Properties The local impulse response approximations for penalized-likelihood image reconstruction in emission tomography (18) and transmission tomography [31] differ only by the definitions of the u i terms in the diagonal matrix. <p> impulse response has the following generic form: l j () [A 0 D A + fiR ( )] 1 A 0 D Ae j ; (20) where D = D [u i ()] is an object-dependent diagonal matrix with u i () defined by (19) for emission tomography and similarly <ref> [31] </ref> for transmission tomography.

Analytical results in <ref> [31] </ref> further simplify the process of building this table for certain tomographs.

Using the analytical results detailed in <ref> [31] </ref> for the system geometry described above, the value fi = 2 4:44 is required for the modified penalty 11 . <p> Fig. 7 shows central horizontal profiles through empirical standard deviation maps of the penalized likelihood estimates for both the modified and the standard quadratic penalties. Also shown is a calculated prediction of the variance, an approximation developed in <ref> [31] </ref>. As noted in footnote 11, the penalties were chosen to have matched resolution at the image center, and in Fig. 7 the estimator variance is also matched at the image center. <p> Quadratic Penalties Are Useful Fig. 8 compares the resolution/noise tradeoff of penalized likelihood with that of images reconstructed by FBP with a Hamming window and with a constrained least-squares (CLS) window developed in <ref> [31] </ref>: sinc (2u)=sinc (u) sinc 2 (2u) + fiu 3 ; u 2 [0; 1 (where u denotes spatial frequency: cycles per radial sample). This window induces a PSF indistinguishable from that of penalized-likelihood estimates with the first-order quadratic penalty [31]. <p> window and with a constrained least-squares (CLS) window developed in <ref> [31] </ref>: sinc (2u)=sinc (u) sinc 2 (2u) + fiu 3 ; u 2 [0; 1 (where u denotes spatial frequency: cycles per radial sample). This window induces a PSF indistinguishable from that of penalized-likelihood estimates with the first-order quadratic penalty [31]. As shown by Fig. 8, at any given resolution the empirical standard deviations for the FBP images are higher than for the penalized-likelihood estimates. This demonstrates that even using the oft-maligned quadratic penalty, penalized-likelihood image reconstruction can outperform FBP in terms of the tradeoff between resolution and noise. <p> VIII. Discussion We have analyzed the local impulse response of implicitly defined estimators (14) and of penalized-likelihood estimators for emission tomography (18) and transmission tomography <ref> [31] </ref>. The analysis and empirical results show that the local impulse response is asymmetric and has nonuniform resolution for Poisson distributed measurements. We proposed a modified regularization penalty (35) that improved the spatial resolution uniformity but not the asymmetry. <p> In principle one could "avoid" this problem altogether by using an unweighted least-squares estimator. We have shown qualitatively in [21] that nonuniform weighting is essential to achieve the desirable noise properties of statistical methods. In <ref> [31] </ref>, we provide additional analyses and quantitative results that demonstrate the importance of weighting. Therefore we advocate retaining the nonuniform weighting that is natural for Poisson statistics, but modifying the penalty to compensate for the undesirable spatial resolution properties. <p> Therefore we advocate retaining the nonuniform weighting that is natural for Poisson statistics, but modifying the penalty to compensate for the undesirable spatial resolution properties. Fortunately this modification does not destroy the benefits of the weighting, as shown in <ref> [31] </ref> and in Fig. 8, apparently because the nonuniform weighting is applied in sinogram space, whereas the penalty acts on the image space.

Reference-contexts: Evaluating (2), one finds that l j is also the jth column of L. (If in addition L is a circulant matrix, then the impulse response is space-invariant, and L corresponds to a convolution <ref> [33] </ref>.) Also note that () = for unbiased estimators, in which case l j = e j . Penalized-likelihood estimators are always biased, so local impulse responses will typically be bump-like functions, rather than the ideal impulse e j (e.g. Fig. 1).

Reference-contexts: If ^ is linear in y, then (10) is exact of course. To illustrate this method, Fig. 1 shows a profile through several local impulse response functions of FBP and of the emission ML-EM algorithm <ref> [39] </ref> (stopped at 30 iterations, well before convergence). The object was a uniform ellipse of activity within a uniform elliptical attenuator (see [31] for details). <p> In both cases the assumed log likelihood has the form: L (; y) = i neglecting constants independent of . In this paper we focus on emission tomography; we derive parallel results for the transmission case in [31]. For emission tomography <ref> [39] </ref>, j denotes the radioisotope concentration in the jth voxel, and the measurement mean is linear in : Y i () = j=1 The fa ij g are nonnegative constants that characterize the tomographic system, and the fr i g are nonnegative con stants that represent the mean contribution of background

Reference-contexts: The c i 's represent ray-dependent factors that change between studies, including detector efficiency factors, dead time, radioisotope decay, and (in PET) attenuation factors. The s j 's represent pixel-dependent factors such as spatial variations in sensitivity, and (in SPECT) "first-order" attenuation correction factors (cf the image-space Chang method <ref> [41] </ref> for SPECT attenuation correction). For our PET work thus far, we have simply used s j = 1. In matrix notation: A = D [c i ] GD [s j ] : (25) This factorization is not unique.

Reference-contexts: If one desires resolution uniformity, then the analysis that follows suggests that one should strive to choose fc i g and fs j g so that G 0 G is "as shift-invariant as possible" (cf (38) below). (See <ref> [42] </ref> for additional analyses of shift-invariant and shift-variant imaging systems.) Substituting (25) into (18) and simplifying: l j () [D [s j ] G 0 D [q i ()] GD [s j ] + fiR ( )] 1 7 In SPECT G will only be approximately object-independent due to attenuation.
