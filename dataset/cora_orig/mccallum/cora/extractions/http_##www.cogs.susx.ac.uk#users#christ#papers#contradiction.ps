Abstract: Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are increasingly used for such purposes as deriving programs [1] and producing designs for robots [2]. According to the building-block hypothesis and schema analysis of Holland [3] the GA is an efficient search method. However, empirical work has shown that in some cases the method is outperformed by simpler processes such as random-permutation hill climbing [4] and [5]. The present paper reexamines Holland's framework (as formulated by Goldberg [6]) and finds that such in-practice failures are predictable given the implications of the schema analysis. The high efficiency of the GA method is commonly attributed to its `implicit parallelism'. However, this efficiency is hard to realise because there is a deep contradiction between the building-block hypothesis and the schema theorem.

Reference-contexts: This produces two offspring genotypes which then replace relatively unfit individuals from the population. 2 Schema analysis At first sight, the C-GA appears to be a way of randomly exploring the space of possible genotypes. However, Holland's schema analysis <ref> [3] </ref> provides an alternative picture. In this analysis we assume that the GA is a way of processing genotype features rather then genotypes themselves | a feature being simply a set of values in specific positions. A particular feature is defined in terms of a schema.

Reference-contexts: It also rests on the so-called building-block hypothesis. This states that the crossover GA works well when short, low-order, highly fit schemas recombine to form even more highly fit, higher-order schemas. In fact, as Forrest and Mitchell <ref> [4] </ref> note, `the ability to produce fitter and fitter partial solutions by combining blocks is believed to be the primary source of the GA's search power.' Unfortunately, when we come to examine the assumptions introduced by the building-block hypothesis, we find that they directly contradict those introduced by the schema theorem. <p> The situation is illustrated schematically in Figure 1. Given the importance of the building-block hypothesis within the GA paradigm this clash of assumptions occurring at the most fundamental level of the analysis is of special interest. As Forrest and Mitchell <ref> [4] </ref> have commented there is a `need for a deeper theory of how low-order building blocks are discovered and combined into higher-order schemas.' 7 Summary As Forrest and Mitchell have noted, confidence in the efficacy of the GA is still largely based on the building-block hypothesis and the schema theorem. <p> The practical failures of the method, such as those reported by Forrest and Mitchell <ref> [4] </ref> for the standard C-GA, and by Lang [5] and O'Reilly [7] for the GP variant, might thus be viewed as a predictable consequence of the arguably contradictory assumptions upon which the method is based. 8 Acknowledgements I am indebted to Inman Harvey for helping me to understand the way in

Reference-contexts: In these simulations, the individuals are candidate solutions to some problem and fitness is a measure of solution quality. The aim is thus to `evolve' high-quality solutions through simulated natural selection. A common way of pursuing this approach involves use of the crossover-based genetic algorithm or C-GA <ref> [6] </ref>. In this approach, candidate solutions are represented as strings of characters or genotypes. Reproduction involves the production of a new individual through the splicing together of genotypes from two `parents'. Parent genotypes are split at a certain point, forming a left part and a right part. <p> Each of these has a high chance of being selected for reproduction. Thus, highly fit schemas will tend to multiply. In fact under pure reproduction, schemas can be expected to grow `as the ratio of average fitness of the schema to the average fitness of the population' <ref> [6] </ref>. Unfit schemas gradually get squeezed out of the population because their instances tend not to be reproduced. The growth formula for schemas in a pure-reproduction scenario is as follows [6]. f (H) Here H is a schema, m (H; t) is the number of instances of H in the population <p> be expected to grow `as the ratio of average fitness of the schema to the average fitness of the population' <ref> [6] </ref>.
