Abstract: We present in this work the application of a set of different evolutionary methodologies in the problem of electronic filter design. The main objectives are to find out which constraints in the filter topologies, if any, must be observed along the evolutionary process and to study the problem of convergence to parsimonious circuits. The new area of Evolutionary Electronics is introduced, an evolutionary methodology based on variable length representation is presented and the results on the evolution of low-pass and band-pass filters are described.

Reference-contexts: Due to the broad scope of the area, researchers have been focusing on different problems, such as placement and routing, evolution of digital circuits based on Boolean gates [11],evolution of sequential circuits [4][11], evolution of passive and active analogue circuits [8][6] <ref> [2] </ref>, evolution of operational amplifiers [10][1] and transistor size optimisation. Of great relevance are the works focusing on intrinsic hardware evolution [12], in which evolution is performed in the own silicon, exploring, therefore, all the physical properties of the medium.

Previous Works We are particularly addressing the case of evolving analogue circuits based on resistors, capacitors and inductors. This task has already been tackled from two different evolutionary perspectives by other authors. J.B. Grimbleby, from the University of Reading <ref> [2] </ref>, has applied Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to synthesise filters for particular frequency and time domain specifications. In his approach, the EAs are used to find the network topology; the component values are determined by numerical optimisation, without evolution. He has used fixed length string structures and integer number chromosome representation.

Reference-contexts: We may visualise the task of Evolutionary Electronics as the one of sampling a search space S consisting of electronic circuits <ref> [3] </ref>. The sampled search space S has the following main features: 1. It is usually very large and formed by circuits of different sizes and topologies; 2. It can be visualised as formed of two sub-spaces [3]: the sub-space of the compliant circuits, S c , and the sub-space of the <p> Electronics as the one of sampling a search space S consisting of electronic circuits <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In his approach, the EAs are used to find the network topology; the component values are determined by numerical optimisation, without evolution. He has used fixed length string structures and integer number chromosome representation. In another application, Horrocks and Spittle from the University of Wales <ref> [6] </ref>, have used Genetic Algorithms to deal with the problem of preferred values electric components selection, particularly resistors and capacitors, to implement active filters. In [7], Horrocks and Khalifa extend this study, taking into account parasitic effects in resistors, inductors and capacitors. <p> The second issue raised is examined by allowing the EA to choose the nature and the value of the component; however, in order to make this application as near as possible to the real electronics world, we restrict resistor, capacitors and inductors to take only the so-called preferred values <ref> [6] </ref>, that are more commonly manufactured. The third issue is of major importance for our work, since it is directly related to our evolutionary methodology.

They evolved a low pass filter with 9 components encoded in 9 genes through binary representation. Though, they have not addressed the case of searching for new topologies.

Reference-contexts: Using a different evolutionary methodology, Koza et. al. have made a large number of works applying the Genetic Programming (GP) methodology in electronic circuit synthesis. In <ref> [8] </ref>[9][1], they have applied Genetic Programming and the Circuit Constructing Tree methodologies [8] to the evolution of a Crossover Filter, evolution of a Brick-Wall Low Pass Filter, evolution of an Asymmetric Bandpass Filter and evolution of an operational amplifier. Both the filter topologies and the component values have been evolved and the SPICE simulator has been used to evaluate the circuits. 4.

Reference-contexts: In order to evaluate the above evolutionary methodologies, we have used two test cases, a low-pass and a band-pass filter, with the following fre quency requirements: 1. Low-pass filter with passing band up to 1000 Hz and stop band above 2000 Hz <ref> [9] </ref>; 2. Band-pass filter with passing band between 2000 Hz and 3000 Hz and stop band below 1000 Hz and above 4000 Hz. Based on Koza's previous works [8][9], we have devised the following fitness evaluation function: fitness = n X w i jT arget i Output i j (1) According <p> The SMASH simulator has been used to evaluate the circuits, in the AC analysis mode. As any kind of arrangement among the components is now possible, many topologies are now not simulatable, receiving a negative fitness value of -1000 <ref> [9] </ref>. We have used an Evolutionary Algorithm with 40 individuals, running over 200 generations, crossover rate of 0.7, mutation rate of 0.02 per genotype position, linear rank selection with truncation, and uniform crossover. Each genotype is formed by 50 positions (10 genes made up of 5 loci).
