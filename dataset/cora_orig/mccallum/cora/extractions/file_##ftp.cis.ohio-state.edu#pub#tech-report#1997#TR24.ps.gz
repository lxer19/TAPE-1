Abstract: Technical Report OSU-CISRC-4/97-TR24, Comp. & Info. Sci. Dept., Ohio State Univ., 1997 1 Abstract We describe the Phase-Space Nonlinear Control Toolbox, a suite of computational tools for synthesizing and evaluating control laws for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems. The Toolbox comprises computational algorithms for identifying optimal control reference trajectories in the phase space of dynamical systems and experimental methods for evaluating performance of the control laws. These algorithms combine knowledge of the geometric theory of modern nonlinear dynamical systems with efficient computational methods for geometric reasoning and graph search; they define the property of controllability and robustness in terms of phase-space geometric structures and exploit the phase-space neighborhood adjacencies to obtain computational efficiency. Compared to the traditional analytic control design methods, the phase-space based control synthesis and evaluation rely on high-performance computational techniques and are applicable to physical systems operating in large nonlinear regimes. Using a proof-of-concept physical experiment for stabilizing a nonlinear magnetic levitation system, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the phase-space control technology.

We use the cell decomposition as a first order approximation to the phase-space geometry to develop practical control synthesis and evaluation methods.

A phase space for a dynamical system is spanned by the independent state variables of the system. For instance, a swinging planar pendulum's phase space is a two-dimensional plane of position versus velocity.

Reference-contexts: Each of these decisions was made by humans based on knowledge of the mechanics of the problem and intuition. It is not hard to imagine that future control systems may be able to formulate strategies such as these automatically <ref> [9] </ref>. The phase-space approach provides a systematic way to explore the control spaces of physical systems. Radically different control behaviors can be automatically synthesized and evaluated by systematically varying operating conditions and initial states of the robots.

Reference-contexts: To apply the gain scheduling technique, one has to decompose the phase space into locally linear regions and design a linear controller for each region. Phase-space control generalizes the decomposition process to permit a systematic computational exploration. Hsu developed a cell-based method called cell-to-cell mapping for approximating state spaces <ref> [10] </ref>. A continuous state space is discretized into regular cells forming a cell space. The associated map of a system becomes a cell-to-cell map which maps one cell to another cell.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, nonlinear control lacks general methods that provide a unified treatment of and approach to a wide class of nonlinear systems. Recent theoretical work on the controllability of nonlinear systems that employs a differential geometric approach is still far from being practical <ref> [11] </ref>. Conventional analytical methods have two important limitations: they require accurate models and labor-intensive simulation and calibration. As an example of a nonlinear control system, we examine the well-studied control problem for legged robots.
