Abstract: This paper presents a performance-oriented placement and routing tool for field-programmable gate arrays. Using recursive geometric partitioning for simultaneous placement and global routing, and a graph-based strategy for detailed routing, our tool optimizes source-sink path-lengths, channel width and total wirelength. Our results compare favorably with other FPGA layout tools, as measured by the maximum channel width required to place and route several benchmarks.

Our detailed-routing algorithm is based on combining a greedy, iterated heuristic [21, 25] with the KMB algorithm; we refer to this hybrid method as the Iterated-KMB (IKMB) algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. Given a routing graph G = (V; E), a net N V , and a set S of potential Steiner nodes, we define the savings of S with respect to N as KMB G (N; S) = KMB G (N ) KMB G (N [ S).

Reference-contexts: The channel width required by FPR is smaller than that required by CGE, SEGA, and GBP in 8 of the 14 benchmark circuits, and is equal on all but one of the remaining 6 benchmark circuits (further improvements have been recently obtained in <ref> [4] </ref>). We also measured how well FPR optimizes total wirelength and maximum source-sink path-lengths or radius.

Reference-contexts: Setting m = n = 3 yields the basic 3 fi 3 partitioning template that is used in our implementation (Figure 2 (a)). Thumbnail partitioning is a generalization of sharp partitioning <ref> [5] </ref>, which in turn is a generalization of quadrisection [38]. (a) (b) (c) (d) (the source is at the upper-left); (c) one of its possible thumbnails; and (d) the associated virtual pins. Our strategy consists of placement and global routing, followed by detailed routing. <p> Each such switch block is then conceptually added as a new "virtual" pin in the net. The portion of each net within each region of the partitioning template is then passed on to a lower level of the recursion (this is similar to the virtual terminal <ref> [5] </ref> and terminal propagation [14] techniques). Thus, the global routing computed for a net corresponds to the topology of its thumbnail. Assignment of nets to switch blocks is accomplished in a manner similar to PHIroute [37].

Reference-contexts: Edge weights in this graph model the cost of assigning a net to the corresponding switch block. Assignments are then determined by computing a minimum-cost matching <ref> [33] </ref>. Recursion terminates when a region contains at most one logic block, along with the adjacent channel segments and switch blocks. We then route nets within the channels surrounding the logic block (if it exists) while minimizing the maximum channel congestion.

Reference-contexts: This grid is called the partitioning template. The placement is then optimized and a global routing is determined relative to the partitioning template using optimal rectilinear Steiner arborescences (RSAs) <ref> [34] </ref> (i.e., minimum-weight shortest path trees). Since m and n are small and fixed, these optimal RSAs (called thumbnails) may be precomputed for efficient lookup during execution. Setting m = n = 3 yields the basic 3 fi 3 partitioning template that is used in our implementation (Figure 2 (a)).

Reference-contexts: FPGA re-programmability is achieved at the expense of performance, as there may be long signal delays through the reconfigurable routing resources [39].

Reference-contexts: We found that in practice, the majority of those nets that fail to route using the initial global route become routable after only a single loosening operation. In cases where wavefront expansion fails to produce a routing solution, we employ a "move-to-front" heuristic <ref> [36] </ref>, where unroutable nets are moved to the beginning of the net-routing order and the new routing order is attempted. 6 Experimental Results Our algorithms have been implemented using C++ in the Sun/UNIX environment and incorporated into FPR.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the global routing computed for a net corresponds to the topology of its thumbnail. Assignment of nets to switch blocks is accomplished in a manner similar to PHIroute <ref> [37] </ref>. The number of nets that can be assigned to each switch block is bounded by the number of nets crossing the cut, divided by the number of switch blocks on the cut.

Reference-contexts: The placement and global-routing phases seek to minimize congestion, thereby enabling the detailed router to find a feasible (and high-quality) solution more easily. However, since it is NP-complete to determine whether there exists a feasible detailed-routing solution for all nets <ref> [41] </ref>, we use a deterministic net-ordering scheme to route nets one at a time. When a detailed-routing solution for a net is found, the corresponding routing resources are committed to that net and are made unavailable for subsequent nets (i.e., they are removed from the underlying graph).
