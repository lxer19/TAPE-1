Abstract: Mobile agents based computing has been propounded as the possible approach to next generation computing. The approach has been shown to be effective in different domains, especially in the area of mobile and partially connected computing. We describe the design and implementation details of MAGENTA (Mobile AGENT environment for distributed Applications) and the mechanisms it provides for enabling applications supporting mobile users. MAGENTA is a generic mobile agent environment and provides the agents the capabilities of autonomy, reactivity, proactivity and communication. In order to demonstrate the functionalities provided by MAGENTA to mobile users we have applied it in the domain of network management in order to implement a Mobile Network Manager (MNM). We also present the performance evaluation results of MAGENTA.

Reference-contexts: There are several other projects which are developing agent environments and few of them are Tacoma [16], Ara [18], Mole [17]. However, the few projects mentioned above have not considered mobile platforms as yet. Some distributed file systems provide support for disconnected operation, as in Coda <ref> [1] </ref> and Ficus [2]. In the Rover system [3] queued RPC and relocatable dynamic objects are used.

Some distributed file systems provide support for disconnected operation, as in Coda [1] and Ficus [2]. In the Rover system <ref> [3] </ref> queued RPC and relocatable dynamic objects are used. These relocatable dynamic objects are incapable of moving halfway through their execution and thus cannot be classified as mobile agents. 4 MAGENTA for mobile users The architecture of MAGENTA comprises of lieus and agents as shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The temporary connections are usually made using telephone lines and the PPP or SLIP protocol. In such a case no movement is possible during the communication and the bandwidth offered by the telephone networks is poor. Permanent connection requires the additional overhead of mobility management and routing. In <ref> [9] </ref> [10] various approaches towards the mobility management in such cases have been proposed. The permanent connections are made using wireless techniques. The wireless networks that are available for usage are cellular networks, wireless LANs, wide area wireless networks and paging networks.

They exchange messages in order to carry out this interaction.

Reference-contexts: The mobile agent approach provides a means of asynchronous and remote execution and thus does not necessitate the presence of the partners. This approach also removes the constraints of message passing and constant bandwidth requirement. Mobile agents have been used for mobile computing in AgentTCL <ref> [14] </ref>. A docking mechanism has been used to provide for the disconnected mode of operation of the portable computer. However, this scheme differs from the scheme we propose in the paper.

Reference-contexts: Network control involves active interference and configuration of the state of the network. A Network Management System (NMS) essentially comprises of a manager managing the network elements and using a management protocol. The management protocol which has found extensive usage is the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) <ref> [20] </ref>. The manager communicates with the SNMP agents executing on the managed nodes through a set of management primitives. The SNMP agents are static programs which execute on the managed nodes and provide the manager the information it requests from time to time.
