Abstract: This paper argues that a shared, distributed name space and I/O interface should be implemented inside the operating system kernel. The grounding for the argument is a comparison between the Sprite network operating system and the Mach microkernel. Sprite optimizes the common case of file and device access, both local and remote, by providing a kernel-level implementation. Sprite also allows for user-level extensibility by letting a user-level process implement the naming and I/O interfaces of the file system. Mach, in contrast, provide general interprocess communication and does not define a file system protocol in the kernel.
