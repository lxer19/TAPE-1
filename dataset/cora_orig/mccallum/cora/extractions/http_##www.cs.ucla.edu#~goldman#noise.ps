Reference-contexts: We wanted to test to see if preprocessing of any kind improves learning performance. We picked a set of 10 functions on 8 binary variables defined in Table 1. These 10 functions were created originally as an attempt to model relationships that might occur in a database <ref> [2] </ref>. KDD stood for knowledge discovery in databases. C4.5 was then given a set of samples to train on and it was compared to the entire function. The training samples it was given was random.

Reference-contexts: The main problem was that no method currently existed for handling noise to make a baseline comparison. But, the software that is available allows for completely specified testing of several other learning methods originally designed to compare against pattern theory. Thus, it was decided C4.5 <ref> [3] </ref> would be ideal since it is able to handle noise already.

Here we mention some other works that are relevant to this report. In Goldman, there are extensive tests comparing C4.5 to Pattern Theory [1].
