Abstract: We present polynomial time algorithms for some fundamental tasks from representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. These involve testing (and constructing) isomorphisms of modules as well as expressing of modules as direct sums of indecomposable modules. Over number fields the latter task seems to be difficult, therefore we restrict our attention to decomposition over finite fields and over the algebraic or real closure of number fields. algebraic numbers, we propose a method for the variant where the matrix X is required to be orthogonal.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, over infinite ground fields, we solve systems of linear equations that depend on the previous intermediate vector v, therefore we do not have any good control over the sizes of the vectors that occur during the iteration. Over sufficiently large fields we have the following generalization of <ref> [1] </ref>, Lemma 5.2. Lemma 8 Let V be an r-dimensional module over the semisimple K-algebra fl and v 1 ; : : : ; v r be a K-basis of V . Assume that v 2 V is an element of non-maximal rank. <p> Proof: We use an argument similar to the proof of Lemma 5.2. in <ref> [1] </ref>. Let w 2 fv 1 ; : : : ; v r g such that Ann fl (v)w 6ae flv. <p> There is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that finds an element v 2 V of maximal rank. 2 We also have a straightforward generalization of the procedure findfree of the paper <ref> [1] </ref>. Theorem 10 Let V be a module over the semisimple K-algebra fl, where K is a finite field or an algebraic number field.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we assume that algebras and modules are given by structure constants over K. We intend to use methods based on computing structural invariants of algebras <ref> [7, 13, 5] </ref> to the module problems outlined above. Unfortunately, finding a nontrivial proper left ideal of fl is already difficult (essentially as hard as factoring integers), even when fl is a non-commutative simple algebra over Q of dimension four [12]. <p> This is necessary to fix the embedding K E. Since K is a perfect field, the radical of algebras and modules can be defined over K. In general, there is no small common intermediate field of definition of the simple components of semisimple algebras over E <ref> [5] </ref>. Therefore we have to allow different constituents of the output of decomposition algorithms to be defined over different intermediate fields. Note that algebras over the ground field F p , the algebraic closure of the finite field F p could be also of interest. <p> We remark that there are deterministic versions of these algorithms which run in time (input size + p) O (1) , where p is the characteristic of the ground field. 14 As for the algebraically or real closed case, we summarize the results of Eberly <ref> [5] </ref>, adapted to our needs. The algorithm proposed by Eberly was originally a Las Vegas method. The deterministic version is due to Ronyai, [14]. Let fl be a semisimple algebra over the algebraic number field K, where K is assumed to be real.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, the conjugacy problem is equivalent to finding a nonsingular matrix in the subspace V . Thus, the conjugacy problem can be considered as a special case of finding nonsingular matrices in linear subspaces of Mat n (K), which was formulated by Edmonds <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we discuss the computational complexity of some principal tasks from representation theory of finite dimensional algebras such as testing and constructing isomorphisms of modules and decomposing modules as direct sums of indecomposable submodules. These problems arise naturally in computations involving several matrices. Holt and Rees <ref> [8] </ref> presents a randomized algorithm (an improvement of the meat-axe method by Parker and Norton [10]) for finding proper submodules of modules over finite algebras. Except the case of modules having a very special structure, the algorithm finds a proper submodule with high probability.

Even worse, it is not known in general whether minimal left ideals of polynomial size exists in non-commutative simple algebras. To get around this difficulty, we restrict our attention to decomposition over finite fields and over the real or algebraic closure of number fields.
