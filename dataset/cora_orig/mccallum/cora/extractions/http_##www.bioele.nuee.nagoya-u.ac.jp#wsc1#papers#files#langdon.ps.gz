Abstract: Previous work showed the combination of a Genetic Algorithm using an order or permutation chromosome combined with hand coded "Greedy" Optimizers can readily produce an optimal schedule for a four node test problem [ Langdon, 1995 ] . Following this the same GA has been used to find low cost schedules for the South Wales region of the UK high voltage power network. This paper describes the evolution of the best known schedule for the base South Wales problem using Genetic Programming starting from the hand coded heuris tics used with the GA.

This approach of hybridising a GA with a problem specific heuristic has been widely studied.

Reference-contexts: At present maintenance schedules are produced manually by NGC's Planning Engineers (who use computerised viability checks on the schedule after it has been produced). Previous work showed the combination of a Genetic Algorithm (GA, <ref> [ Holland, 1992 ] </ref> ) using an order or permutation chromosome combined with hand coded "Greedy" Optimizers can readily produce an optimal schedule for a four node test problem [ Langdon, 1995 ] (see also Figure 5).

Reference-contexts: Where these primitives take arguments, they are checked to see if they are within the legal range. If not the primitive normally evaluates to 0.0 6.3 Mutation Approximately 90% of new individual are created by crossover between two parents using GP crossover (as <ref> [ Koza, 1992 ] </ref> except only one individuals is created at a time). The remainder are created by mutating a copy of a single parent. Two forms of mutation are used with equal likelihood.

The function and terminal sets include indexed memory, loops and network data. Indexed memory was deliberately generously sized to avoid restricting the GP's use of it. It consists of 4,001 memory cells each containing a single precision floating point value.

Reference-contexts: These components are not combined instead selection for reproduction and replacement uses Pareto tournaments and fitness niches <ref> [ Langdon, 1996 ] </ref> . The cost and CPU penalty are determined when the individual is created but the novelty reward is dynamic and may change whilst the individual is within the population. The CPU penalty is the mean number of primitives evaluated per line.

Reference-contexts: This is allowed by repeatedly calling the evolved program, so having processed all 42 tasks it called again for the first, and then the second, and the third and so on. Processing continues until a fixed CPU limit is exceeded (cf. PADO <ref> [ Teller and Veloso, 1995 ] </ref> ). 8 Discussion The permutation GA approach has a significant advantage over the GP approach in that the system is constrained by the supplied heuristic to produce only legal schedules.
