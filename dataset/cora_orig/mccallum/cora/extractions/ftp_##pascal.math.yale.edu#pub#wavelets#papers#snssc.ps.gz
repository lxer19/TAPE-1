Abstract: We describe an algorithm to estimate a discrete signal from its noisy observation, using a library of orthonormal bases (consisting of various wavelets, wavelet packets, and local trigonometric bases) and the information-theoretic criterion called minimum description length (MDL). The key to effective random noise suppression is that the signal component in the data may be represented efficiently by one or more of the bases in the library, whereas the noise component cannot be represented efficiently by any basis in the library. The MDL criterion gives the best compromise between the fidelity of the estimation result to the data (noise suppression) and the efficiency of the representation of the estimated signal (signal compression): it selects the "best" basis and the "best" number of terms to be retained out of various bases in the library in an objective manner. Because of the use of the MDL criterion, our algorithm is free from any parameter setting or subjective judgments. Wavelet transforms and their relatives such as wavelet packet transforms and local trigonometric transforms are becoming increasingly popular in many fields of applied sciences. So far their most successful application area seems to be data compression; see e.g., [14], [6], [35], [30]. Meanwhile, several researchers claimed that wavelets and these transforms are also useful for reducing noise in (or denoising) signals/images [16], [7], [10], [21]. In this paper, we take advantage of both sides: we propose an algorithm for simultaneously suppressing random noise in data and compressing the

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm can also be viewed as a simple yet flexible and efficient realization of the "complexity regularization" method for estimation of functions proposed by Barron <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Our approach, although restricted in the sense of Barron, provides a computationally efficient and yet flexible realization of the complexity regularization method, especially compared to the library consisting of polynomials, splines, trigonometric series discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, we assume each m is equally likely, i.e., p (m) is a uniform distribution. Remark. Even though the list of models M does not include the true model, the MDL method achieves the best result among the available models. See Barron and Cover <ref> [4] </ref> for detailed information on the error between the MDL estimate and the true model. We also would like to note that the MDL principle does not attempt to find the absolutely minimum description of the data.
