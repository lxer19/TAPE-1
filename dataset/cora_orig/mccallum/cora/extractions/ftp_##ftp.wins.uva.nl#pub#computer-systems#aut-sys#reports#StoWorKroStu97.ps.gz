Reference-contexts: Fig. 1. The profiles as depicted by LoadScanner A frequently used projection method for visualization is the `Sammon' projection method, where the data points are projected in such a way that the interdatapoint distances are preserved as well as possible <ref> [1] </ref>. Consider a finite set of samples fx i g, with x i 2 &lt; N . The distance between two samples is defined as d fl ij = d (x i ; x j ) Let r i 2 &lt; 2 be the image of x i .

Reference-contexts: Compute the ffi ij = d fl d ij (r i r j ), derived from the Sammon error eq.[ 1]: 4. Adjust the weights of the network by backpropagation of this ffi A similar method has been proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. We used this method for the projection of the data. We used 14372 profiles representing the booking behaviour of the M-class resp. the C-class for all fights to North America during one year. Every profile is considered as a point in the 20-dimensional input-space.
