Abstract: The technique of Level of Detail (LOD) offers a powerful method of reducing the computational burden of a virtual reality (VR) system. As a result, it represents a valuable and important facility which one would expect to find in all serious VR graphics systems. This survey aims to present many of the rendering engines commonly employed in state-of-the-art VR solutions and details the degree of support which these systems provide for LOD. The investigation reveals a significant lack of support for this facility over the range of packages reviewed. Consequently, a call is made for improved LOD support in future VR products.

Reference-contexts: Level of Detail (LOD) offers a means of improving the performance of a VR system under certain circumstances by trading visual detail for speed <ref> (Astheimer & Poche, 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The distance values are used to select the appropriate child node (LOD model) to use depending upon the object's distance from the viewpoint <ref> (Bell et al., 1995) </ref>. Manual LOD selection can be performed with the Switch node, similar in operation to the SoSwitch facility of Open Inventor (see above). However, because VRML is a file format and is not programmable, the scope for manual LOD is limited. 15.

Reference-contexts: Also, another application of LOD is to automatically balance the system's computational load in an attempt to maintain a fixed frame rate <ref> (Funkhouser & Sequin, 1993) </ref>. Due to the performance benefits which can be accrued through the use of LOD in the time-critical domain of VR, one might conclude that it offers an invaluable asset which should be incorporated into every serious VR graphics system.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, it is this case which most people associate with the term LOD. It should be noted however that other modulation schemes are possible: such as relating LOD to an object's motion <ref> (Hitchner & McGreevy, 1993) </ref> or peripheral location (Reddy, 1995). Also, another application of LOD is to automatically balance the system's computational load in an attempt to maintain a fixed frame rate (Funkhouser & Sequin, 1993).
