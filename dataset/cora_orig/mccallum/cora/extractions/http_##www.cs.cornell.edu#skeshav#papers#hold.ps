Abstract: issue of network pricing. We collected data to empir-ically model the workload. The data shows temporal locality of reference in all traces. LRU based holding time policies use this temporal locality effectively and perform better than any other strategy examined. To our surprise, timer based schemes perform poorly. However, the LRU-delay scheme, which corresponds to a fixed system-wide timeout, is effective and trivial to implement. We have studied a number of variations of holding time policies and have found that none of the variations offer significant improvements in performance over the basic strategies discussed here. We wish to thank Bruce Mah at UC Berkeley and Peter Danzig at the University of Southern Califor-nia for helping collect the traces. Thanks also to Ra-mon Caceres at Matsushita Labs, who suggested the relevance of pricing in studying holding times, and made several useful comments on an earlier draft of this work.
