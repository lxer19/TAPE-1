Reference-contexts: This enables our robots to acquire fundamental sensor-motor couplings rapidly, requiring a couple of learning steps only. The following sections describe the robots, the controller architecture and the experiments we conducted regarding learning in mobile robots. More details about these experiments can be found in <ref> [Nehmzow 92] </ref>. 2 Competence Acquisition, using Artificial Neural Networks 2.1 The Robots The experiments described in this paper were conducted with two small mobile robots, shown in figure 1. Alder is controlled by an ARC52 controller, based on the 8052 microprocessor, having 16k of RAM. <p> The fact that it learns very quickly is bought at the price that it can only learn functions that are linearly separable ([Minsky & Papert 88]). The functions Alder and Cairngorm had to learn in the particular experiments discussed in this paper are linearly separable (see <ref> [Nehmzow 92] </ref> for a discussion of this point), it was therefore possible to use the Pattern Associator in these experiments as an associative memory, associating stimuli with robot motor actions.

Reference-contexts: Also, the experiment shows that the behavioural repertoire of the robots can easily be expanded by adding instinct-rules, an observation that will be amplified by the following experiment (see also <ref> [Nehmzow 93] </ref>). 5 Corridor Following As just stated in section 4, it is easy to extend the behavioural repertoire of the robot by adding further instinct-rules. <p> We have not yet found a natural limit in the number of independent competences the robot can acquire in the way described here (see <ref> [Nehmzow 93] </ref>); how competences that interfere with each other can be accomplished is another open research area. Other issues concern the choice of "magic numbers" such as the learning rate (see, concerning this, [Ramakers 93]), the size of network, the encoding of sensor signals and the encoding of motor actions.

Reference-contexts: and Boxpushing In order to show how the behavioural repertoire of a robot can be expanded to more complicated tasks, changing the instinct-rules only, we conducted experiments with an R2 mobile robot, which was equipped with light sensors and range finding infrared sensors (for a description of this robot see <ref> [Nehmzow & McGonigle 94] </ref>). Phototaxis was acquired within less than ten learning steps, using an instinct-rule stipulating that the light sensors mounted at the front of the robot must return the highest value (i.e. face the brightest light).

Reference-contexts: Other issues concern the choice of "magic numbers" such as the learning rate (see, concerning this, <ref> [Ramakers 93] </ref>), the size of network, the encoding of sensor signals and the encoding of motor actions.

Reference-contexts: The structure of the controller used for this experiment is shown in figure 6, the instinct-rules contained in the monitor are shown in figure 7. The network had only two input nodes, the input vector presented to the network is shown in figure 8. 1 Interestingly, <ref> [Waterman 1989, p. 135] </ref> reports that North American desert ants Novomersor are able to follow a pheromone trail, albeit crookedly, if their antennae (their chemoreceptors) are swapped. 2 We have indicated this by writing this instinct-rule in brackets. 8 ' $ ? - Monitor Input Vector Motor Actions Action Signal Select!

Reference-contexts: We use fixed rules for this purpose which we call instinct-rules. They are similar, but not identical to instincts as defined by <ref> [Webster 81] </ref>: an instinct is a "complex and specific response on the part of an organism to environmental stimuli that is largely hereditary and unalterable though the pattern through which it is expressed may be modified by learning, that does not involve reason, and that has as its goal the removal
