Abstract: In clinical applications using large apertures, a significant number of phased array elements may be blocked due to discontinuous acoustic windows into the body. These blocked elements produce undesired beamforming artifacts degrading spatial and contrast resolution. To minimize these artifacts, an algorithm using multiple receive beams and the total-least-squares (TLS) method is proposed in this paper. Simulations and experimental results show that this algorithm can effectively reduce imperfections in the point spread function of the imager. Combined with first and second order scatterer statistics derived from multiple receive beams, the algorithm is modified for blocked element compensation on distributed scattering sources. Results also indicate that compensated images are comparable to full array images. Indeed, even full array images can be improved by removing undesired sidelobe contributions. This method, therefore, can enhance detection of low contrast lesions using large phased array apertures.

Reference-contexts: To improve specificity as well as sensitivity, two-dimensional, very large apertures (VLA) are desired to enhance beam pattern quality, e.g., mainlobe width and sidelobe distribution. To maintain good contact, conformable arrays are of particular interest to provide acoustic coupling to the body over large areas <ref> [1] </ref>. Due to spatial inhomogeneities and the discontinuous nature of acoustic windows into the body, however, several key problems arise limiting overall image quality for VLAs. First, phase aberrations due to sound velocity inhomogeneities and irregular array geometry are likely to distort propagation wavefronts. <p> As illustrated in Figure 1, the number of array elements influenced by gas and bone obstructions may be a substantial fraction of the total area of a VLA <ref> [1] </ref>. Channels receiving no signal are easily detected because their average amplitudes as a function of range are very small compared to the overall amplitude across the aperture. <p> Two-dimensional arrays use different beamforming architectures than one-dimensional devices [4]. Even limited two-dimensional arrays designed for full three-dimensional dynamic focusing but steering only in a single plane (i.e., anisotropic or 1.5-dimensional arrays) use beam formers fundamentally different from those of conventional one-dimensional phased array imagers <ref> [1] </ref>. Consequently, specific compensation methods for blocked elements will certainly differ for one-dimensional and two-dimensional array systems. Nevertheless, the blocked element problem is the same in principles for both one and two-dimensional cases.

Reference-contexts: These channels should not be allowed to contribute to either transmit or receive beamforming. For a fully adaptive array system including a complex correlator for each channel, as described in 2 reference <ref> [2] </ref>, amplitude statistics across the array can be easily acquired as a function of range. Using this information, blocked elements can be detected and turned off. Note that the number and distribution of disabled elements can vary as a function of both transmit beam direction and range.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, with a fully adaptive system, blocked elements can be translated into missing, i.e., inoperable elements. These missing elements, however, are likely to produce severe artifacts depending on their number and position <ref> [3] </ref>. In this paper, adaptive compensation of blocked elements rendered inoperable will be explored. Two-dimensional arrays use different beamforming architectures than one-dimensional devices [4].

Reference-contexts: The display dynamic range in both panels is 40 dB. Clearly, sidelobes are higher if array elements are missing. Figure 3 shows images of a graphite-gel phantom anatomically approximating a human heart displayed over a 30 dB dynamic range <ref> [5] </ref>. They are reconstructed using a 64 element, 15.7 mm wide, one-dimensional array with a 3.33 MHz operating frequency. A full aperture is used in the left panel whereas 16 elements (17-24, 33-40) are missing in the right panel.

Reference-contexts: Two specific methods are discussed in the following paragraphs. Optimal beamforming principles from array signal processing can be applied to the 4 missing element problem [6-9]. One example is the recursive adaptive beamforming algorithm developed by Frost <ref> [7] </ref>, where optimal beamforming coefficients are derived by minimizing the array output power subject to multiple linear constraints. Solutions can be obtained either by Lagrange multiplier methods or by projection theory [10].

Reference-contexts: One example is the recursive adaptive beamforming algorithm developed by Frost [7], where optimal beamforming coefficients are derived by minimizing the array output power subject to multiple linear constraints. Solutions can be obtained either by Lagrange multiplier methods or by projection theory <ref> [10] </ref>. A similar approach can be applied to the missing element problem, where total sidelobe energy can be used as the object function and multiple linear constraints can be used to control the shape of the beam pattern.

Reference-contexts: Without knowledge of the object of interest, however, changing the shape of the beam pattern does not necessarily improve image quality. Another possible object independent solution is the direct beam synthesis technique developed for hyperthermia arrays <ref> [11] </ref>. This method formulates the relation between aperture weighting and the desired field pattern by a linear forward propagation operator based on the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral. Using this relation, a minimum-norm (or least squares) solution of the optimal aperture weighting function can be found using a pseudo-inverse technique.

Reference-contexts: By carefully choosing control points, it has been shown that sidelobe levels over certain scan angles can be reduced at the price of degrading other sidelobes <ref> [12] </ref>. Preliminary experimental studies show that the direct synthesis technique can improve complex beam patterns. If the image of interest includes distributed targets, however, minor improvements in the beam pattern do not guarantee significant image quality improvement. In other words, contrast resolution cannot be enhanced simply by relocating sidelobes.

Reference-contexts: In particular, adaptive beamforming methods have been developed in RADAR based on measurements of the covariance matrix of array outputs. Using these measurements, complex array weights are derived such that the reception of a far field signal along a direction of interest can be optimized in some statistical sense <ref> [13] </ref>. The array weights are chosen to adapt to signal and noise characteristics. In medi 6 cal ultrasound, however, objects are generally in the near field. Reconstructions must be performed adaptively as a function of time (i.e., range) and slight offsets in target distribution may produce totally different lateral responses.

Reference-contexts: Currently, multiple receive beamforming is used to increase image frame rate by acquiring simultaneous image lines from a single transducer firing. Possible applications are ultrafast cardiac-valve ultrasonic tomography (i.e., images that need higher temporal resolution), noise reduction (by signal averaging) and real-time three-dimensional imaging <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. Since multiple image lines are acquired from a single, broad transmit beam, overall pulse-echo beam quality is degraded. Consequently, reduction in both spatial and contrast resolution are expected for applications using multiple receive beams to form independent image lines from a single transducer excitation.

Simultaneous processing of multiple receive beams (also known as "Explososcan" <ref> [15] </ref>) was originally developed for high speed ultrasound imaging. Potential applications of this method, however, should not be limited. As shown in this paper, multiple receive beams can be used to enhance the image quality of severely degraded images. Other possible applications should be continuously explored in the future.

Reference-contexts: Several possibilities for simplification are discussed below. Independent delay-and-sum structures are needed for each receive beam due to the near field nature of medical imaging. To overcome hardware limitations, a method for multiple receive beam formation using spatial Fourier processing has recently been developed <ref> [16] </ref>. Instead of delay-and-sum structures, this method utilizes simple CORDIC rotators to form multiple receive beams. Up to 8-16 receive beams can be formed while maintaining good quality using this simple hardware structure.

Reference-contexts: Speed improvement of the TLS computation itself can be achieved by calculating only 21 the desired basis of the singular subspace in SVD <ref> [19] </ref>. Pipelined hardware structures for SVD can also be implemented in real-time. Although all simulations and experiments in this study were performed using a one-dimensional transducer array, extension of the method to two-dimensional apertures is straightforward.

Scattering from tissue approximates a Rayleigh distribution, although deviations from Rayleigh statistics have been noted and used for tissue characterization [25, 27]. Nevertheless, the assumption of Rayleigh distributed speckle is reasonable in developing a simple classification method.

Reference-contexts: Other possible applications should be continuously explored in the future. Finally, the compensation method presented here may also be applied to sparse arrays.

Such arrays represent 22 a limiting case of the missing element problem. That is, such arrays can be considered two-dimensional arrays with a large number of missing elements. Perhaps, the methods presented here also can significantly improve the performance of these systems.
