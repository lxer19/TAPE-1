Reference-contexts: Because the mechanism of this behavior is complex, it is difficult to link to specific transmission components or properties. Past work by researchers such as Hidaka, et al., [2] has noted the influence of transmission compliance and kinematic error on vibration during operation. Also, observations by Good, et al., <ref> [1] </ref> among others, note the effect of nonlinear friction on transmission performance. In this section, past observations will be extended by analyzing the typical, experimental timeresponse of a harmonic drive and rationalizing the observed behavior in terms of known transmission properties. <p> For example, as past research indicates, harmonic-drive models such as the one presented by Hidaka, et al., [2] must employ nonlinear compliance as well as kinematic-error disturbances to ensure validity. Other representations, such as the one described by Good, et al., <ref> [1] </ref> also require nonlinear friction behavior to maximize model integrity. Last, as discussed in section 2, an accurate model must also include a mechanism for displaying heightened frictional dissipation at system resonance.

Past work by researchers such as Hidaka, et al., <ref> [2] </ref> has noted the influence of transmission compliance and kinematic error on vibration during operation. Also, observations by Good, et al., [1] among others, note the effect of nonlinear friction on transmission performance. <p> In addition to capturing ideal transmission gear-reduction behavior, the complexity of the experimental response in Figure 2 suggests that nonideal transmission properties must also be incorporated into the harmonic-drive model. For example, as past research indicates, harmonic-drive models such as the one presented by Hidaka, et al., <ref> [2] </ref> must employ nonlinear compliance as well as kinematic-error disturbances to ensure validity. Other representations, such as the one described by Good, et al., [1] also require nonlinear friction behavior to maximize model integrity. <p> From the experimental stiffness profile shown in Figure 7, the characteristic stiffening-spring behavior of harmonic-drive flexibility can be observed. To replicate the nonlinear shape of this curve, independent researchers such as Hidaka, et al., <ref> [2] </ref> and Volkov, et al., [8] recommend approximating the stiffness torque, T k , by a cubic function of torsion: T k = k 1 (Dq k ) + k 2 (Dq k ) , (13) where k 1 is the linear stiffness coefficient, k 2 is the cubic stiffness coefficient,

Reference-contexts: Compliant behavior, on the other hand, is not as easy to pinpoint as friction. In particular, past research by Margulis, et al., <ref> [3] </ref> and Yanabe, et al., [9] has indicated that, in addition to deflection in both the flexspline and circular spline gear-teeth, significant deflection may occur radially in the wave-generator as well.

Reference-contexts: The velocity-dependent friction, also shown in Figure 6, is manifested as a nonlinear friction curve that increases with velocity. Although this plot shows that the friction torque always increases with velocity, work by researchers such as Marilier and Richard <ref> [4] </ref> indicates that friction in some drives can actually decrease over some velocity ranges. As illustrated in the figure, this nonlinear friction curve can be modeled accurately by a cubic approximation. The third friction component can be seen in the experimental step-response of harmonic-drive output.

Reference-contexts: Research by Nye and Kraml <ref> [5] </ref>, among others, has demonstrated that typical kinematic-error signatures vary periodically at once and twice the rotational frequency of the wave-generator, as measured relative to the flexspline, and subsequent harmonics.

Reference-contexts: A more general but more complicated three-port model derivation can be found in Tuttle <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition to capturing ideal transmission gear-reduction behavior, the complexity of the experimental response in Figure 2 suggests that nonideal transmission properties must also be incorporated into the harmonic-drive model. <p> Specifically, by balancing the forces across each component in Figure 4, a set of equations can be derived to relate the torques at the three harmonic-drive ports to the positions and velocities at these ports. This analysis is not shown here but can be found in detail in Tuttle <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Experimental measurements made by Tuttle <ref> [7] </ref> indicate that friction at non 10 zero velocities in harmonic drives can be characterized as having four components: (1) constant friction, (2) velocity-dependent friction, (3) position-dependent friction, and (4) friction from resonance vibration.
