Reference-contexts: It is due to this tra 4 dition that probabilists have always attributed nonpropositional character to conditional sentences (e.g., birds fly); refusing to allow nested conditionals [Levi, 1988], and insisting on interpreting one's confidence in a conditional sentence as a conditional probability judgment <ref> [Adams, 1975] </ref> (see also [Lewis, 1976].

Reference-contexts: A related formulation of causal effects, based on event trees and counterfactual analysis was developed by Robins (1986, pp. 1422-25). Calculi for actions and counterfactuals based on this interpretation are developed in [Pearl, 1994b] and <ref> [Balke & Pearl, 1994a] </ref>, respectively. 4 Counterfactuals A counterfactual sentence has the form If A were true, then C would have been true? where A, the counterfactual antecedent, specifies an event that is contrary to one's real-world observations, and C, the counterfactual consequent, specifies a result that is expected to hold <p> The connection between counterfactuals and policy making was formulated in <ref> [Balke & Pearl, 1994a] </ref> using the network representation of causal theories. The probability of a counterfactual sentence is computed by the following steps: First, the available observations are used to update the joint probability of the exogenous U variables (viewed as constant, but unknown boundary conditions, see Eq. (3)).

Reference-contexts: Finally, the probability of the counterfactual consequent is evaluated using the mutilated network as in (9). It turns out that, unlike causal effect queries, counterfactual queries are not identifiable even in Markovian theories, but require that the functional-form of ff i g be specified. In <ref> [Balke & Pearl, 1994b] </ref> a method is devised for computing bounds on counterfactual probabilities which, under certain circumstances may collapse to point estimates.

Reference-contexts: In certain structures, called webs <ref> [Dalkey, 1994, Dechter & Pearl, 1991] </ref>, Simon's causal ordering determines a unique one-to-one correspondence, but in others, such as those involving feedback, the correspondence is not unique. Yet in examining feedback circuits, for example, people can assert categorically that the flow of causation goes clockwise, rather than counterclockwise.

Reference-contexts: The majority of the philosophers who have examined the semantics of counterfactual sentences have resorted to some version of Lewis' "closest world" approach; "C if it were A" is true, if C is true in worlds that are "closest" to the real world yet consistent with the counterfactuals antecedent A <ref> [Lewis, 1973] </ref>. Ginsberg [1986], followed a similar strategy. The drawback of the "closest world" approach is that it leaves the precise specification of the closeness measure almost unconstrained.

Reference-contexts: Some of these conditions are structural, nicely formulated in Simon's "causal ordering" <ref> [Simon, 1953] </ref>, and others are substantive invoking relative magnitudes of forces and powers. The structural requirement is that there be a one-to-one correspondence between mechanisms and variables a unique variable in each mechanism is designated as the output (or effect), and the other variables, as inputs (or causes).
