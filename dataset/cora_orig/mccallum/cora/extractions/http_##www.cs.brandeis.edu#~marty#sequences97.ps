Title: Asymmetry in Ziv/Lempel '78 Parsing  
Author: Martin Cohn and Harald Helfgott 
Address: Waltham, MA 02254, USA  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department, Brandeis University  
Abstract: We the compare the number of phrases created by Ziv/Lempel '78 parsing of a binary sequence and of its reversal. We show that the two parsings can vary by a factor that grows at least as fast as the logarithm of the sequence length. We then show that under a suitable condition, the factor can even become polynomial, and argue that the condition may not be necessary.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The parsing rule introduced by Ziv and Lempel in 1978 [ZivL'78] has been the origin of a number of fast, lossless data compression algorithms, among them LZW, the basis of UNIX "compress"; Miller-Wegmann; and LZFG. <ref> [BellCW'90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: can be stated as "repeatedly parse the shortest phrase that has not been parsed before", or equivalently as "repeatedly parse the longest phrase that has been parsed before, plus the next symbol." With sensible encoding, the rule leads to procedures whose compression ratio converges to optimality for stationary, ergodic sources <ref> [CoverT'91] </ref>. Given the right data structure, the procedure is fast, and easy to implement. It has long been known that this rule and derived procedures produce pars-ings of different sizes (cardinalities) when applied to a sequence and to its reversal.

Reference-contexts: and Kadota studied the question, cited specific sequences where the difference was large, and conjectured that the complexities "...can differ by an arbitrarily large factor if [the number of phrases] is large enough." 1 Supported by NSF Grant NCR-930-5027 2 Supported by the Nathan and Bertha Richter Award, Brandeis University <ref> [GilbertK'92] </ref>. Our purpose here is to give a lower bound on that factor for an infinite class of sequences, the bound growing as the logarithm of sequence length. In the process we also get a reversal lower bound for the original Lempel-Ziv complexity measure [LempelZ'76].

Reference-contexts: Here n is the degree of the underlying deBruijn sequence, thus the logarithm of its length, and also the logarithm of the length of the overall concatenation. A binary deBruijn sequence of degree n <ref> [Knuth'81] </ref> is a sequence of length N = 2 n + n 1 in which every binary ntuple occurs exactly once. 3 We use the notation d j i to mean the sequence d i d i+1 d j for i j.

The complexity measure defined by Lempel and Ziv in their 1976 paper was called by the authors "C LZ " <ref> [LempelZ'76] </ref>. This measure is defined by parsing a string according to the rule "repeatedly parse the longest substring which can be found to begin earlier in the string" here the new substring need not have been an earlier parsed phrase.
