Abstract: It is commonly, often tacitly, assumed that the mutual-intelligibility of natural language dialogue is underwritten by a common semantic code. Ultimately, this assumption is both emprically and conceptually unsustainable and adequate models of dialogue need to provide for ways in which semantic conflicts can be addressed. One possiblity for resolving such conflicts is by the use of some form of matching strategy to accomodate situations in which interlocuters do not share the same semantic model. The most clearly articulated proposal along these lines is the Input-Output coordination model. This paper examines this model and, on the basis of data obtained from a task-oriented dialogue, argues that it does not provide a sufficient mechanism for the resolution of semantic conflicts.
