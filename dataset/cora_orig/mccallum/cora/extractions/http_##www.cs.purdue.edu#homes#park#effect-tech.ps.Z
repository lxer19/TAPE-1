Abstract: Recent measurements of network traffic have shown that self-similarity is a ubiquitous phenomenon present in both local area and wide area traffic traces. In this paper, we study the effect of scale-invariant burstiness on network performance when the functionality of the transport layer and the interaction of traffic sources sharing common network resources is incorporated. We investigate the traffic-shaping effect of congestion control and reliable message transmission when all network traffic is initiated at the application layer by the transfer of files or messages whose size is heavy-tailed. This allows for an intrinsic evaluation of the influence of transport layer protocols in helping to induce and modulate self-similarity in the downstream link traffic without the traffic source itself having to be given as a self-similar time series. We show that resource-boundedness, conservation of flow through reliable transport, and end-to-end congestion control are important variables in determining the characteristics of aggregate traffic at bottleneck links, affecting how network resources are utilized, and how network performance depends on link bandwidth/buffer space, heavy-tailedness of file size distribution, and the particular control mechanisms employed. Our conclusions can be summarized as follows. First, congestion control and reliable communication are crucial components in translating heavy-tailedness of file size distribution into link traffic self-similarity. Network performance as captured by throughput, packet loss rate, and packet retransmission rate degrades gradually

Ns is an event-driven simulator derived from S. Keshav's REAL network simulator supporting several flavours of TCP (TCP Tahoe and TCP Reno whose congestion control features include Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit/Recovery) and router scheduling algorithms. <p> Although not production TCP code, we have found ns's emulation of TCP satisfactory for the purposes of studying congestion control as well as emulating reliable transport. A test suite description can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. We have modified ns in order to model our interactive client/server environment. This entailed extending the one-way data flow restriction of a single ns TCP session to full-duplex, and implementing the client/server nodes as separate application layer agents.

Reference-contexts: We employ transport/network-layer simulations of reliable and unreliable transport protocols with, and without, congestion control. Our results are facilitated by a high-level approach 1 to self-similar traffic generation <ref> [13] </ref> that allows the degree of link traffic self-similarity to be in-trinsically and intimately controlled by a mechanism acting at the application layer. In a nutshell, this process involves the generation of file or message transfers whose size distribution is heavy-tailed (formal definition given later). <p> In a nutshell, this process involves the generation of file or message transfers whose size distribution is heavy-tailed (formal definition given later). In other words, files and messages of extremely large size are communicated with non-negligible probability among nodes in a networked system. In <ref> [13] </ref> it was shown that this high-level structural mechanism suffices to generate link traffic self-similarity, and the degree of the observed self-similarity was shown to be directly related to the heavy-tailedness of the file size distribution. <p> The application layer is completely characterized by the probability distributions mentioned in Section 2.2, the file size distribution being the main control variable with idle time distribution playing a secondary role. In <ref> [13] </ref>, we have shown that independent of the idle time distribution, file size distribution alone suffices to induce self-similar link traffic by making the distribution more or less heavy-tailed.

Our work is related to the ON/OFF model of Willinger at al. <ref> [15] </ref> where it is shown that the superposition of a large number of independent 0/1 reward processes whose ON/OFF durations, if heavy-tailed, results in fractional Gaussian noise when suitably normalized. <p> The main drawback of this simple elegant characterization is the independence assumption of the traffic streams in the system which ignores their interaction in real networks competing for shared network resources leading to the coupling of the traffic sources. This paper complements the findings of <ref> [15] </ref> by taking into account the limitations of network resources and the influence exerted by transport protocols when servicing transfer requests generated by the application layer. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. <p> Thus, by suitably adjusting the inter-packet spacing parameter t , the utilization (middle), and mean queue length (right) as a function of ff. 22 maximum arrival rate of a traffic source is controlled. As t ! 1, the traffic source becomes more and more like the ON/OFF model of <ref> [15] </ref> (except for the finite number of traffic sources) due to the decoupling achieved by making the consequences of resource contention negligible. 4ms, 6ms, 8ms. For small t , we observe the characteristic nonlinear increase in packet loss rate as ff ! 1.
