Abstract: The Cooperative Intelligent Real-time Control Architecture (CIRCA) automates the process of designing, scheduling, and executing real-time reactive monitoring and control systems. This paper provides an overview of CIRCA from a design-automation perspective, and illustrates the architecture's ability to dynamically alter its control system design based on resource limitations or environmental constraints.

Reference-contexts: The AIS may have several different methods for performing an action (or a test), and it can choose amongst them according to the resources available. This tradeoff method is equivalent to the "configuration selection" (Kuo and Mok 1991), "version selection" (Malcolm and Zhao 1991), and "design-to-time" <ref> (Garvey and Lesser 1994) </ref> approaches. For example, suppose that the Puma control system provides the RTS with two different types of part-placement operations, a slow, high-accuracy, "fine-motion" operation and a faster, lower-accuracy, "coarse-motion" operation. This means that the system has two possible primitive operators for the place-part-in-box action transition.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION The Cooperative Intelligent Real-time Control Architecture (CIRCA) <ref> (Musliner et al. 1993, Musliner et al. 1995) </ref> is designed to automate the entire process of building a real-time reactive monitoring and control system, from planning tasks, to deriving their constraints, to scheduling them, and finally to executing them predictably. <p> CIRCA makes several contributions to the state of the art, including a world model and planning algorithm tailored to the needs of hard real-time environments (Musliner et al. 1995), and a structured interface through which the arbitrarily complex AI planning subsystem can communicate with and control the predictable, guaranteed RTS <ref> (Musliner et al. 1993) </ref>. This paper focuses on describing the overall operations of CIRCA from an automated-design perspective, emphasizing the way CIRCA retains predictable real-time behavior while also providing the flexibility and adaptability required for intelligent real-time control. Fig. 2. The example Puma domain. <p> While the AIS is performing its planning process, the RTS is simultaneously executing the previously-generated reactive control plan, maintaining guaranteed system safety. This unique combination of communicating but isolated AI methods and hard real-time response guarantees is one of the main performance features of the CIRCA architecture <ref> (Musliner et al. 1993, Musliner et al. 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The RTS is designed to provide a predictable execution environment which can enforce hard real-time response guarantees for the planned reactions. The development of CIRCA makes several contributions to the state of the art, including a world model and planning algorithm tailored to the needs of hard real-time environments <ref> (Musliner et al. 1995) </ref>, and a structured interface through which the arbitrarily complex AI planning subsystem can communicate with and control the predictable, guaranteed RTS (Musliner et al. 1993).

Reference-contexts: The goal of attainment is to pack parts into the box. The design phase of the process builds a tentative control system; CIRCA builds a reactive control plan using lookahead planning methods similar to STRIPS <ref> (Nilsson 1980) </ref>. The reactions are cast in the form of simple Test-Action Pairs (TAPs) that specify the appropriate control actions for various possible future states of the world.
