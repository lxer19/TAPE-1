Abstract: Recent theoretical developments in using the Interacting Boson Model to describe nuclear structure effects in fusion reactions below the Coulomb barrier are reviewed. Methods dealing with linear and all orders coupling between the nuclear excitations and the translational motion are discussed, and the latter is found to lead to a better description of the barrier distribution data. A systematic study of the available data (cross sections, barrier and spin distributions) in rare-earth nuclei is presented.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is by now well established that to describe fusion cross sections one needs to include coupling of relative motion to other degrees of freedom <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. These extra degrees of freedom yield a distribution of barriers [3] and consequently enhance the cross section below the barrier [4, 5]. <p> The recent experimental determination of average angular momenta [6] and the barrier distributions [7] have provided even more stringent tests for such models. The natural language to study multidimensional barrier penetration is the coupled channels formalism, which was widely used in investigating subbarrier fusion phenomena <ref> [1] </ref>. An alternative formulation of the multidimensional quantum tunneling is given by the path integral formalism [4]. An algebraic nuclear structure model significantly simplifies evaluation of the path integral.

(3) has a dynamical or spectrum generating symmetry, i.e. if it can be written in terms of the Casimir operators or generators of a given Lie algebra, then the solution of Eq. (3) is an element of the corresponding Lie group <ref> [4] </ref>. Consequently the two time influence functional of Eq. (8) is simply a diagonal group matrix element for the lowest-weight state and it can be evaluated using standard group-theoretical methods.

Reference-contexts: Path integral formulation of this problem, as sketched in the next section, requires analytic solutions for the nuclear wave functions. In our first attempt in using IBM to describe nuclear structure effects in subbarrier fusion, we employed the SU (3) limit of IBM <ref> [9] </ref>. However, the SU (3) limit corresponds to a rigid nucleus with a particular quadrupole deformation and no hexadecapole deformation, a situation which is not realized in most deformed nuclei. <p> The two-time influence functional for the sd-version of IBM was calculated in Ref. [11] and, for the particular case of the SU (3) limit, in Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>. The above method corresponds to a linear coupling approximation. Due to the exponential nature of fusion cross sections, it is not clear at the outset whether one can include the effects of the higher order terms in H int through a renormalization of the coupling strength.

Reference-contexts: Thus analytic solutions away from the limiting symmetries of the IBM are needed for realistic calculations of subbarrier fusion cross sections. In a parallel development, a 1/N expansion was investigated <ref> [10] </ref> for the IBM which provided analytic solutions for a general Hamiltonian with arbitrary kinds of bosons. This technique proved useful in a variety of nuclear structure problems where direct numerical calculations are prohibitively difficult.

To illustrate the quality of this global fit, in Fig. 1 we compare our theoretical result for the 16 O + 148 Sm, 16 O + 154 Sm, and 16 O + 186 W systems with the data from the Australian National University. <p> In this respect, the transitional Os-Pt region is of particular interest. One expects that barrier distributions for transitional nuclei exhibit sharp changes due to shape-phase transitions, contrary to vibrational and rotational nuclei where the cross sections increase smoothly with increasing deformation or mass number <ref> [13] </ref>. An accurate measurement of subbarrier fusion cross sections for transitional nuclei such as Pt and Os provides a sensitive test for competing models in this region and possibly point to new directions in research.

Reference-contexts: Neglecting the resulting centrifugal and Coriolis terms in this rotating frame is equivalent to ignoring the angular dependence of the original Hamiltonian. In this approximation, the coupling form factors become independent of ` and only m = 0 magnetic sub-states of the target are excited <ref> [15] </ref>. For heavy systems, the neglected centrifugal and Coriolis forces are small. We take the scattering to be in the x-y plane.
