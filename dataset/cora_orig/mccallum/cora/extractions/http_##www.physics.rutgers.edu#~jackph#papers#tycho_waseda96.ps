Abstract: Tycho Brahe in AD 1572 has been determined using observations by ROSAT. From two High Resolution Imager (HRI) pointings separated in time by 4.5 yr, I determine a mean expansion rate for the blast wave of 0:420:06 00 yr 1 , which is larger than published results from optical and radio observations. The X-ray expansion is consistent with the dynamical evolution expected from a young ejecta-dominated remnant which has experienced only modest deceleration. I find evidence for differential expansion in that the interior of the remnant appears to be expanding at a somewhat slower rate. The expansion rate varies significantly with azimuth as well. In particular, I find that two small knots in the southeastern part of Tycho are moving more rapidly than any other feature in the X-ray image. Previous work has established that these knots are clumps of highly enriched stellar ejecta with very different abundance distributions. This is the first evidence for ejecta "bullets" in the remnant of a Type Ia SN.

Reference-contexts: The azimuthally-averaged X-ray results presented here are rather consistent with this latter model. The expansion shows significant azimuthal variation as well. The two small X-ray bright knots in the southeast are particularly interesting, since earlier work <ref> (Vancura, Gorenstein, & Hughes 1995) </ref> has revealed that these features are almost surely highly enriched knots of SN ejecta with very different abundance distributions. The northern one is apparently rich in Si and S, while the southern one is Fe rich. <p> These ejecta fragments in Tycho are similar in many respects to the recently discovered ejecta fragments beyond the apparent boundary of the Vela SN blast wave <ref> (Aschenbach, Egger, & Trumper 1995) </ref>. Although the current velocities of the Vela ejecta bullets are small (390-650 km s 1 ), their angular distance from the estimated site of the SN explosion require large mean transverse velocities: 4000-5000 km s 1 as well as significant deceleration.

Reference-contexts: As is well known, this model assumes that the ejecta are dynamically insignificant, so its applicability to Tycho's SNR, where the ejecta are clearly dominant, is questionable. Models where the SN ejecta are important have been developed by Chevalier 4 <ref> (1982) </ref> in which the ejecta and the ambient medium are assumed to be in the form of power-law density profiles.

Reference-contexts: One possible explanation for the difference with the X-ray results may be that the radio expansion was obtained over the entire radial extent of the remnant. This would tend to "dilute" the effect of the fastest moving material at the outermost rim of the remnant. 3. Discussion The Sedov <ref> (1959) </ref> similarity solution for the dynamical evolution of SNRs predicts an expansion rate of n = 0:4. As is well known, this model assumes that the ejecta are dynamically insignificant, so its applicability to Tycho's SNR, where the ejecta are clearly dominant, is questionable.
