Abstract: Visual tracking is applicable to many tasks in robotic assembly and inspection, including peg-in-hole insertion, alignment of parts, and gaze control. A fast, robust, hybrid approach to feature tracking is presented. Rotation-compensated normalized cross-correlation is used to handle large rotations. Adaptive templates allow for some changes in lighting and background. The tracking system runs at 8Hz. and is demonstrated in a peg-in-hole insertion task.

Reference-contexts: Thus for any manipulator configuration the peg-to-base transformation is approximately known. The geometric model of the peg (vertex-edge representation) expressed in the manipulator base frame is matched with the images of the peg observed in each camera using the matching technique described in <ref> [1] </ref>. This matching is used to construct correspondences between the image-object features in either camera. Using at least four non-coplanar model points (such as corners) and their correspondences, a weak perspective affine invertible transform [6] (of dimensions 4 fi 4 ) that is the base-to-camera transform is constructed.

Reference-contexts: The hole-to-camera transform is computed similarly. By expressing the hole and peg frames in the manipulator base frame using these transforms , a pose error in the base frame can be computed. This pose error is used to derive manipulator commands that robustly traces a pre-planned contact space trajectory <ref> [2] </ref>. The process of line extraction and model matching is slow compared with filtering and correlation, and it is only performed once to initialize the appropriate number of templates.

Reference-contexts: Thus, visual feature tracking can be used to close a feedback loop around the pose of an object. This enables the construction of controllers that servo a manipulator or mobile robot to a desired pose or to trace a desired trajectory <ref> [3, 5] </ref>. In this paper we describe a new tracking technique and it's application to visually servo a manipulator with poor kinematics in a peg-in-hole insertion task described below. <p> In addition features such as corners can be inferred by computing the intersections of the appropriate edges. Rotation-compensated normalized correlation is used to localize the templates in appropriate search windows around their hypothesized locations and is discussed below. 3. Template Localization Normalized correlation <ref> [3] </ref> is a well known match measure and a search for the maximum correlation score of a template over a search window is typically use to localize an image patch in the window. However, this scheme is sensitive to rotations.

Each edge location (gradient local maximum) is a candidate for a match with the template and correlation is performed at these locations. This reduces the search space.
