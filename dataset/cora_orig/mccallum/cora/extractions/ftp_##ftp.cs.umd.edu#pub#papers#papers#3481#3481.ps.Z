Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of word-sense ambiguity in extraction from machine-readable resources for the construction of large-scale knowledge sources. We describe two experiments: one which took word-sense distinctions into account, resulting in 97.9% accuracy for semantic classification of verbs based on (Levin, 1993); and one which ignored word-sense distinctions, resulting in 6.3% accuracy. These experiments were dual purpose: (1) to validate the central thesis of the work of (Levin, 1993), i.e., that verb semantics and syntactic behavior are predictably related; (2) to demonstrate that a 20-fold improvement can be achieved in deriving semantic information from syntactic cues if we first divide the syntactic cues into distinct groupings that correlate with different word senses. Finally, we show that we can provide effective acquisition techniques for novel word senses using a com bination of online sources.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper addresses the issue of word-sense ambiguity in extraction from machine-readable resources for the construction of large-scale knowledge sources. We describe two experiments: one which took word-sense distinctions into account, resulting in 97.9% accuracy for semantic classification of verbs based on <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>; and one which ignored word-sense distinctions, resulting in 6.3% accuracy.

These experiments were dual purpose: (1) to validate the central thesis of the work of (Levin, 1993), i.e., that verb semantics and syntactic behavior are predictably related; (2) to demonstrate that a 20-fold improvement can be achieved in deriving semantic information from syntactic cues if we first divide the syntactic cues into distinct groupings that correlate with different word senses. <p> Finally, we show that we can provide effective acquisition techniques for novel word senses using a combination of online sources, in particular, Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978), Levin's verb classification scheme <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>, and WordNet (Miller, 1985). <p> We demonstrate that verb meaning can be systematically derived from information about syntactic realizations; these meaning components are used to build verb entries which are then ported into different languages. 3 Syntax-Semantics Relation: Verb Classification Based on Syntactic Behavior The central thesis of <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> is that the semantics of a verb and its syntactic behavior are predictably related. As a demonstration that such predictable relationships are not confined to an insignificant portion of the vocabulary, Levin surveys 4183 verbs, grouped into 191 semantic classes in Part Two of her book. <p> In particular, we depart from the alternation-based data in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>, which is primarily binary in that sentences are presented in pairs which constitute an alternation. Following Saint-Dizier's work, we construct N-ary syntactic characterizations.

Reference-contexts: In such cases, the objective is typically to build a large set of translation equivalences between words and phrases, e.g., for transfer MT. Others who have taken a more knowledge-based (interlin-gual) approach <ref> (Lonsdale et al., 1996) </ref> do not provide a means for systematically deriving the relation between surface syntactic structures and their underlying semantic representations. Such approaches tend to ignore the wide range argument structures (beyond intransitive and transitive) that could potentially be associated with verbs.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we show that we can provide effective acquisition techniques for novel word senses using a combination of online sources, in particular, Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978), Levin's verb classification scheme (Levin, 1993), and WordNet <ref> (Miller, 1985) </ref>. <p> Our current direction is to make use of the results of the first two experiments, i.e., the relation between syntactic patterns and semantic classes, but to use two additional techniques for disambiguation and classification of non-Levin verbs: (1) extraction of synonym sets provided in WordNet <ref> (Miller, 1985) </ref>, an online lexical database containing thesaurus-like relations such as synonymy; and (2) selection of appropriate synonyms based on correlations between syntactic information in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978) and semantic classes in Levin.

The basic idea is to first determine the most likely candidates for semantic classification of a verb by examining the verb's synonym sets, many of which intersect directly with the verbs classified by Levin.
