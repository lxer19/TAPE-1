Abstract: In comparison, our encoder achieved 69% efficiency for fast encoding on 9 processors. The overall speed was just under 4 frames per second. The network limitations cause this reduction in efficiency. It should be noted that even if a faster network is used, problems may still occur with I/O. If the network has a capacity of 10 Mb/s, and I/O bandwidth is 2 MB/s (16 Mb/s), then any bottleneck caused by the network masks any problems with I/O performance. If I/O becomes a bottleneck, one possible solution (other than using compressed input frames) is to use multiple disks. Processors could use their local disks to temporarily store encoded frames. If the input frames were stored on local disks, that would help even more. We have achieved our goal of creating a portable, parallel MPEG-1 encoder. The code was first distributed to the Internet in July 1993. Over 2,500 copies have been distributed to date (May 1994). The key to creating an efficient encoder is to optimize the motion vector search especially the error calculation. Other operations are less important in time significance. In addition to this optimization, we implemented a variety of different search techniques to account for varying encoding requirements. A coarse-grained parallel version of the encoder was implemented. Close to linear speed-up can be gained, up to some limit dependent on I/O and network performance. We used a simple adaptive scheduling algorithm in which the scheduler estimates how many frames each processor can encode in a fixed time interval. [1] Ketan Patel, Brian C. Smith, and Lawrence A.
