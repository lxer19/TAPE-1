Abstract: Given a real number ff &lt; 1, every language that is weakly P n ff=2 T -hard for E or weakly P n ff T -hard for E 2 is shown to be exponentially dense. This simultaneously strengthens results of Lutz and Mayordomo(1994) and Fu(1995).

Reference-contexts: These same remarks apply to P n ff T -hardness. The relationship between weak hardness notions for E and E 2 is somewhat different. Juedes and Lutz <ref> [8] </ref> have shown that weak P m -hardness for E implies weak P m -hardness for E 2 , and their proof of this fact also works for weak P T -hardness.

Here we use the following precise variant of this result. <p> A p-martingale is a martingale that is, for some k 2 N, an n k -martingale. A p 2 martingale is a martingale that is, for some k 2 N, a 2 (log n) k -martingale. Definition (Lutz <ref> [9] </ref>) 1. A set X of languages has p-measure 0, and we write p (X) = 0, if there is a p martingale d such that X S 1 [d]. 2. <p> Note that this does not assert that "(XjE)" has some nonzero value. Similarly, the expression (XjE 2 ) 6= 0 means that X does not have measure 0 in E 2 . It is shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that these definitions endow E and E 2 with internal measure structure.

Reference-contexts: The next big step was the proof by Lutz and Mayordomo <ref> [10] </ref> that, for every real number ff &lt; 1, E 6 P n ff tt (DENSE c ): (5) This improved Watanabe's result from O (log n) truth-table (i.e., nonadaptive) queries to n ff such queries for ff arbitrarily close to 1 (e.g., to n 0:99 truth-table queries). <p> Moreover, Lutz and Mayordomo <ref> [10] </ref> proved (5) by first proving the stronger result that for all ff &lt; 1, p (P n ff tt (DENSE c )) = 0; (6) which implies that every language that is weakly P n ff tt -hard for E or for E 2 = DTIME (2 poly ) is <p> Thus, if E 6 BPP (which is generally conjectured to be true), almost every language is weakly P n ff tt -hard, but not P n ff tt -hard, for E, so the result of Lutz and Mayordomo <ref> [10] </ref> is much more general than the fact that every P n ff tt -hard language for E is dense. 2 A word on the relationship between hardness notions for E and E 2 is in order here. <p> In any case, (6) implies that, for every ff &lt; 1, every language that is weakly P n ff tt -hard for either E or E 2 is dense.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the mid-1970's, Meyer <ref> [15] </ref> proved that every P m -complete language for exponential time|in fact, every P m -hard language for exponential time|is dense. <p> That is, the objective is to prove that E 6 P T (DENSE c ); (2) where P T (DENSE c ) is the class of all languages that are P T -reducible to non-dense languages. The importance of this objective derives largely from the fact (noted by Meyer <ref> [15] </ref>) that the class P T (DENSE c ) contains all languages that have subexponential circuit-size complexity. (A language A f0; 1g fl has subexponential circuit-size complexity if, for every real number * &gt; 0, for every sufficiently large n, there is an n-input, 1-output Boolean fl This research was supported <p> more famous conjecture, that E 6 P T (SPARSE); (3) where SPARSE is the class of all sparse languages. (A language A f0; 1g fl is sparse if there is a polynomial q (n) such that jA n j q (n) for all n 2 N.) As noted by Meyer <ref> [15] </ref>, the class P T (SPARSE) consists precisely of all languages that have polynomial circuit-size complexity, so (3) asserts that E contains languages that do not have polynomial circuit-size complexity.
