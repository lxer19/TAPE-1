Abstract: We present here a distributed problem-solving testbed, which we use for experimental analysis of the relationships among distributed problem structure, inter-agent communication and coordination strategies, and problem-solving performance. Distributed problems in our system are represented as distributed CSPs. The testbed consists of two parameterized components: (1) a problem generator, for the creation of distributed CSPs in specific classes with respect to distributed problem structure, and (2) a multi-agent problem solver, capable of employing various communication, coordination and local problem-solving strategies. We are beginning to use this system to evaluate hypotheses about the performance of different strategies for communication of partial subproblem results as a function of distributed problem structure.

Reference-contexts: We work with those abstract characterizations of problem structure that we feel best capture the important aspects of the underlying structure of problems. One domain-independent characterization that we employ is constrainedness <ref> (Gent, MacIntyre, & Prosser 1996) </ref>, which is implemented in our random CSPs via the density and distribution of nogoods, or sets of inconsistent assignments. <p> In this work, we use a generalized measure of constrainedness developed by <ref> (Gent, MacIntyre, & Prosser 1996) </ref>, and derive the number of nogoods secondarily. In addition, for the distributed context, we augment the centralized problem description by including the number of agents and describing how the variables and nogoods are distributed among the agents.

Reference-contexts: These characteristics relate to problem size, and various aspects of the density and distribution of constraints within and among the agents. In earlier work on the relationship between problem structure, problem-solving algorithms, and solution cost for centralized CSPs <ref> (Mammen & Hogg 1997) </ref>, we specified problems using just three parameters: number of problem variables, n, domain size of variables, b, and number of nogoods, m. In this work, we use a generalized measure of constrainedness developed by (Gent, MacIntyre, & Prosser 1996), and derive the number of nogoods secondarily.

Reference-contexts: Our work would extend this research by addressing the relationships between strategy and problem characteristics in a way that could be readily transferred to other domains.

Our work will contribute to further understanding of how we can employ those strategies most effective for the problem, statically or dynamically.

Reference-contexts: Information about appropriate strategy selection as a function of problem structure may be used either statically, based on initial problem (or problem class) structure, or dynamically, as problem structure changes during problem solving. For example, <ref> (Sen & Durfee 1992) </ref> found that in distributed meeting scheduling different communication and commitment strategies were better for some types of problems than others. Our work would extend this research by addressing the relationships between strategy and problem characteristics in a way that could be readily transferred to other domains.

Reference-contexts: We call any subset of an agent's subproblem a partial subproblem. With this general overview of our goals, assumptions, and approach, we next present a description of our parameterized multi-agent problem generator. We follow this with an outline of our multi-agent problem-solving algorithm, an extension of <ref> (Yokoo 1995) </ref>'s asynchronous weak-commitment search algorithm, including the ways in which our multi-agent algorithm is parameterized, and why. Finally, we outline the kinds of experiments we plan to carry out in this testbed, and the kinds of results we expect to produce. <p> Neither computation nor communication are "free" in our model, as both take time, which is used as the ultimate common currency. Based on Yokoo's asynchronous weak-commitment search algorithm <ref> (Yokoo 1995) </ref>, our algorithm allows for parallel processing among the agents and is guaranteed to correctly find a solution if one exists, or report that none does.
