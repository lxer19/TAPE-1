Reference-contexts: Another extension consists of allowing each source node to know only partial topology information, using an approach similar to the one proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>. Finally, the heuristic described in this paper needs to be incorporated into an appropriate multicast routing protocol.

Reference-contexts: This requirement can be supported using one of many topology-broadcast algorithms, which can be based on flooding (as is the case in OSPF and IS-IS) or other techniques <ref> [2] </ref>. BSMA is based on the feasible search optimization method. This method minimizes the objective function constrained inside a feasible region. A good survey on the feasible search optimization method is given in [4].

Reference-contexts: Bharath-Kumar and Jaffe discuss optimization on both cost and delay <ref> [3] </ref>. However, they assume that cost and delay functions are identical.

Reference-contexts: BSMA is based on the feasible search optimization method. This method minimizes the objective function constrained inside a feasible region. A good survey on the feasible search optimization method is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. The feasible region R b for the DMST problem consists of the set of all delay-bounded Steiner trees. BSMA starts with an initial tree T 0 2 R b , and iteratively refines the tree for low cost while staying in the feasible region.

Reference-contexts: IA constructs an initial Steiner tree and iteratively transforms the Steiner tree to get to the global minimum. IA may stay at the same tree for a maximum of n iterations. By Cayley's Theorem <ref> [5] </ref>, there are n n2 possible spanning trees on n nodes; Thus the number of Steiner trees spanning n s (n s n) is then bounded by n n2 . The number of Steiner trees spanning n s nodes is then bounded by n n2 since n s n.

Reference-contexts: Previous optimization techniques for multicast routing algorithms have considered the above two optimization objectives, but have treated them as distinct problems. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [6] </ref> can be used to generate the shortest paths from the source to destination nodes; this provides the optimal solution for delay optimization. Multicast routing algorithms that perform cost optimization have been based on computing the minimum Steiner tree which is known to be NP-complete problem [8]. <p> BSMA consists of two major steps; a skeleton flowchart is shown in Fig. 2. Step 1 constructs the initial tree T 0 which is a minimum-delay Steiner tree, with respect to the multicast source, using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. Step 2 then iteratively refines T 0 for low cost. Fig. 3 shows an example network and the corresponding minimum-delay Steiner tree for a multicast group in the network.

Reference-contexts: Multicast routing algorithms that perform cost optimization have been based on computing the minimum Steiner tree which is known to be NP-complete problem [8]. Some heuristics for the Steiner tree problem <ref> [10, 13, 15, 7] </ref> have been developed that take polynomial time and produce near optimum results. In Kou, Markowsky and Berman's (KMB) algorithm [10], a network is abstracted to a complete graph consisting of edges that represent the shortest paths among source node and destination nodes.

Some heuristics for the Steiner tree problem [10, 13, 15, 7] have been developed that take polynomial time and produce near optimum results. <p> The DMST problem based on minimizing the sum of link costs in T can be reduced to a minimum Steiner tree problem with the delay bound set to 1, which is known to be an NP-complete problem <ref> [8] </ref> and only heuristics are of practical interest for its solution; BSMA is a new heuristic designed to solve the DMST problem. 3 Description of BSMA 3.1 Overview BSMA assumes that the source node has complete information regarding all network links to construct a multicast tree.
