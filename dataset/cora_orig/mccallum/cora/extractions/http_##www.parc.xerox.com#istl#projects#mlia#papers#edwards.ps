Abstract: To provide assistance with tasks such as retrieving USENET news articles or identifying interesting Web pages, an intelligent agent requires information about a user's interests and needs. Machine learning techniques are now being used to acquire this information. A general architecture is presented, and two approaches to learning through observation are described. An instantia-tion of the architecture is then evaluated.

Reference-contexts: Results indicated that learning techniques can be used to identify news articles of interest, and that they have a number of benefits over the use of information retrieval techniques such as tfidf (see Lang (1995) for details). A similar study has been carried out with WorldWide Web documents. WebWatcher <ref> (Armstrong et al. 1995) </ref> compared the use of a tfidf based classifier with the linear threshold algorithm, Winnow (Little-stone 1988) in searching for links to technical papers. Each training instance was represented by a vector of approximately 530 boolean features, taken from four fields. <p> However, such vectors can be large, as their size is dependent on the number of different features selected from the corpus. Various approaches have been proposed to limit the size of vectors produced. For example, WebWatcher considers only a subset of features from the whole corpus <ref> (Armstrong et al. 1995) </ref>. We have investigated two approaches which avoid the use of vectors. The first approach relies on creating a number of training instances for each observation (Figure 3).

Reference-contexts: Related Work A number of systems have been developed which combine machine learning techniques with information filtering techniques to create user profiles. Lira <ref> (Balabanovic & Yun 1995) </ref> employed a term-frequency/inverse-document frequency (tfidf ) weighting to extract a fixed number of terms from WorldWide Web pages. These were then used to construct a number of vectors which were used by a Web robot to search and score matching pages.

Reference-contexts: The second method makes use of traditional knowledge engineering techniques to identify background knowledge about the application and the user. This technique has been applied to advisory agents, such as UCEgo <ref> (Chin 1991) </ref>, which provides advice on using the UNIX operating system. Whilst this shifts the task of programming the agent from the user to the Knowledge Engineer, the agent will not be customised for a particular user.

Reference-contexts: A variety of learning mechanisms have been employed within agent systems to induce such profiles. Genetic algorithm approaches have been used for news filtering agents (Sheth 1994); symbolic rule induction algorithms such as C4.5 (Quinlan 1993) and CN2 <ref> (Clark & Niblett 1989) </ref>, and instance-based approaches (Stan-fill & Waltz 1986; Kibler & Aha 1987) have been used with mail and news filtering tasks (Metral 1993; Payne & Edwards 1995; Payne, Edwards, & Green 1995) and automated Web browsing (Bayer 1995; Balabanovic & Yun 1995). <p> We have investigated two approaches which avoid the use of vectors. The first approach relies on creating a number of training instances for each observation (Figure 3). Learning algorithms such as C4.5 (Quinlan 1993) and CN2 <ref> (Clark & Niblett 1989) </ref> expect training instances which contain a single value for each attribute.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess the relative perfor mance of these techniques for agent systems, due to the ad hoc nature of much of the evaluation performed. This can perhaps be explained by the lack of standard data sets within the UCI Machine Learning Data Repository <ref> (Murphy & Aha 1994) </ref>. One recent trend has been the development of agent systems to act as comparative testbeds for learning techniques (Armstrong et al. 1995; Blum 1995; Lang 1995; Payne & Edwards 1995).

Reference-contexts: The remaining terms are rated using a measure of term significance. The highest rated terms are used in the instances. A number of different measures of term significance have been compared, including term frequency, term frequency/inverse document frequency (tfidf ), and term relevance <ref> (Salton & McGill 1983) </ref>. The term frequency measure (Equation 4) assumes that the importance of a term is directly proportional to the frequency with which it appears within a document.
