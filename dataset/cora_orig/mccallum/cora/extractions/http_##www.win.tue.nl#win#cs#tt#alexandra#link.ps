Reference-contexts: There is only one flag set at a time. See <ref> [Inm89] </ref>. 2.3 Configuration In the configuration of the links a choice can be made for the number of bytes to send in parallel. One transputerline can transfer one byte (8 bits) of data.

Reference-contexts: A Phylan board and an Ethernet board can be integrated in a node of the EMPS hardware. Software can be downloaded from the Sun host via a PC and Phylan to the EMPS hardware as described in <ref> [Jan94] </ref>. 1.2 Word conversion over Phylan A PC, needed to link Ethernet and Phylan, requires a conversion of the data format. The kernel software is downloaded from a Sun host via a PC with an Intel processor to the MC68030 processor. The kernel software initializes and controls the Phylan board. <p> It should be noticed that the times measured could be improved with a small value by recovering the changes that had to be made for the compiler bug as described in <ref> [Jan94] </ref>. With these results the timing behaviour can be used for clock synchronisation.

Reference-contexts: Communication media in the EMPS Communication within the EMPS between two processors is possible via: * VME system bus for inter-cluster communication * VSB bus for intra-cluster communication * Transputer links for fast direct inter-processor communication The busses and communication registers together with bus protocols make communication possible between processors. <ref> [vD93] </ref> illustrates the computer module interfaces of the EMPS hardware. Two RS232 serial connections can be used for terminals for example. Internode processor communication is possible via the VSB/VME bus and Phylan or Ethernet. <p> The processes within a node can share common memory for communication. For internode communication no shared common memory can be used. A difference is made between communication within one node of the EMPS and between different nodes. See <ref> [vD93] </ref> for more details. <p> An other alternative is the use of private memory to store a message. This increases performance as shown in figure 4.3 by the thickest solid line. The dotted line represents the performance times as presented in <ref> [vD93] </ref>. An improvement of a performance time of 9.64 ms has been achieved by the transputer links compared to the communication between two processors in different nodes communicating via Phylan.
