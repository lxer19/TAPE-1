Reference-contexts: In 1972 Horton and Miller (1972) reported fewer than a dozen cases from the preceding fifty years; by 1986 six thousand cases had been diagnosed <ref> (Coons, 1986) </ref>. As Hacking (1995, note 14 p. 270) remarks, "the most reliable predictor of the occurence of multiple personality is a clinician who diagnoses and treats multiples"; Hacking also notes the curious geographical correlation between diagnosis and therapeutic techniques (p. 14).

Humans rarely show good calibration, however. We can measure calibration by, for example, asking people to assign probabilities to some collection of assertions pulled out of a fact book, half of them being negated.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach to analyzing arguments that is quite popular, giving rise to many textbooks, is due to Toulmin; see Toulmin et al. (1979) and Toulmin (1958). The Toulmin-line of textbooks share most of the weaknesses of the majority, specifically including an underappreciation of the role of induction <ref> (it has some additional weaknesses as well, discussed in Freeman, 1991) </ref>. The critical reasoning literature represents an educational movement to foster critical and analytical approaches to argumentation. It is represented, for example, in Ennis (1962) and Paul (1984) and in the journal Informal Logic.

Reference-contexts: The further inference, from the correlation (or absence of correlation) to a causal structure that would explain that correlation, is again subject to various possible complaints; however, the structure of such arguments is beyond the scope of this paper <ref> (see Giere, 1991, or Korb, 1997) </ref>. In general, inductive arguments are attacked by showing that the premises are not representative of the facts put forward in the conclusion, i.e., that some bias is operating in the argument. This implies that inductive arguments, unlike deductive arguments, are sensitive to background information.

Reference-contexts: Even if the amplified testimony in such cases is based upon some underlying real impulses, it is clear that the technique is open to serious abuse by incorporating ideas from the facilitator, whether or not such incorporation is intentional <ref> (Hudson, 1995) </ref>. Recovered memories are those which people have revealed during special therapy sessions, often decades after the alleged events being recalled. Many of these cases also have involved allegations of sexual abuse and have led to great social disruption and multi-million dollar court cases.

A good overview, relating the psychology of deduction to the psychology of induction, is Evans (1989). 13 The explanation of this impact lies in a generalization of Bayes's rule for conditionalization, called Jeffrey conditionalization <ref> (Jeffrey, 1983) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Overconfidence is enhanced when the judgment is made more difficult or complex <ref> (Pitz, 1974) </ref>. Another way of expressing this is that easier tasks are assessed more accurately. <p> Another way of expressing this is that easier tasks are assessed more accurately. This suggests that training in particular domains will improve calibration on problems within the domain, by making people more knowledgeable and therefore judgments easier; and, indeed, experimental studies support this conclusion <ref> (see Pitz, 1974, and Edwards and von Winterfeldt, 1986) </ref>. In general, the literature on overconfidence suggests that we should tend to qualify predictions put forward by non-experts (including ourselves), particularly when they are extreme. Hindsight and Memory At the end of our inductive reasoning comes hindsight.

Reference-contexts: Such treatment is a serious disservice, since inductive argumentation is a key to the majority of practical arguments deployed in science, industry, politics and ethics. This likely contributes to the nearly universal failure to find skills learned in logic classes having any payoff outside of those classes <ref> (e.g., Pollard and Evans 1980) </ref>. Here I review a few fallacious forms of argument, noting both merits and demerits. Equivocation Scriven's first step in the analysis of argument is the clarification of meanings.

A recent meta-analysis of that literature has found little or no correlation between the confidence of eyewitnesses and the accuracy of their identifications (Sporer et al., 1995).
