Abstract: The Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU) collects, annotates and distributes telephone speech data to enable research in spoken language understanding and automatic language identification. This paper gives a brief overview of recent activities in pursuit of this mission. We summarize corpus development activities at CSLU and describe new corpora useful for research on specific tasks: alphabet recognition, numbers recognition, large vocabulary word recognition, and yes/no recognition. We then discuss our two newest data collection efforts, Cellular Speech and the 22-Language Telephone Speech Corpus. All CSLU corpora are available at no charge to academic institutions.

Reference-contexts: Pauses, or periods of relative silence in the signal, are also marked. Convention Development CSLU develops and documents all transcription conventions used in the transcribed speech corpora. For complete coverage of current CSLU labeling conventions, contact Terri Lander at tlander@cse.ogi.edu, or see <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. Labeler Reliability We periodically run experiments measuring inter-labeler reliability. This provides a baseline for inter-labeler agreement which can then help us realistically mea sure system performance.
