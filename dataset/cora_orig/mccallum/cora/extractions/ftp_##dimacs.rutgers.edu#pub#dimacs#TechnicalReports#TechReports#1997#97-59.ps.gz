Reference: [1] <author> L. W. Beineke, R. J. Wilson, </author> <title> On the edge chromatic number of a graph, </title> <journal> Disc. Math. </journal> <volume> 5 - 13 </volume> - 
Reference-contexts: Clearly, each critical graph of even order is non-trivial. Nevertheless the critical graph conjecture, independently formulated by Jakobsen [15] and Beineke, Wilson <ref> [1] </ref>, claiming that every critical graph has odd order, is false. Goldberg [12] constructed an infinite family of 3-critical graphs of even order. The smallest graph of this family has 22 vertices. Another counterexample a 4-critical graph on 18 vertices was independently found by Chetwynd and Fiol, cf. [14, 21].

Reference-contexts: In [5] the authors showed that the graphs found by Goldberg and by Chetwynd, Fiol are the smallest 3- and 4-critical graphs of even order, respectively. Based on results of <ref> [2] </ref> the first complete list of critical graphs of order n 8 and of even order n 10 was given in [10]. The gap for n = 9 was closed in [6] and hence for all n 10 the critical graphs of order n are known. <p> Then G is not subgraph of a k-regular graph on 12 vertices. 3.2 The Proof Theorem 1.2 is true for k = 2. For k = 3 and 4 this is proved in <ref> [2] </ref> and [9, 11], respectively. For k = 8 this follows from more general results of [7], and for k = 9; 10; 11 it is a consequence of results of [17, 18]. Thus to prove Theorem 1.2 we have to solve the cases k = 5; 6; 7; 8.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 3.3 For all k 3, a k-critical graph of even order contains at least 3 vertices of degree smaller than k. The following is a generalization of the well known Parity Lemma <ref> [3] </ref>. Lemma 3.4 (Parity Lemma) Let G be a graph whose edges are coloured with colours 1; : : : ; c, and let a i be the number of vertices v in G such that no edge incident to v is coloured i.

Reference-contexts: In fact, v i and v j , 1 i &lt; j 3 do not even have a neighbour in common. Thus identifying v 1 ; v 2 and v 3 yields a 6-regular class 2 graph on 10 vertices. But such graphs do not exist, cf. <ref> [4] </ref>. If jV j = 4 then follows from Lemma 3.8 (3) that (G fl ) = 5 4 6 8 .

Reference-contexts: Recently Grunewald and Steffen [13] constructed k-critical graphs of even order for each k 3. It is still of interest which are the smallest k-critical graphs of even order, and Yap [21] posed the problem whether there are k-critical graphs of order 12, 14 or 16. In <ref> [5] </ref> the authors showed that the graphs found by Goldberg and by Chetwynd, Fiol are the smallest 3- and 4-critical graphs of even order, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Based on results of [2] the first complete list of critical graphs of order n 8 and of even order n 10 was given in [10]. The gap for n = 9 was closed in <ref> [6] </ref> and hence for all n 10 the critical graphs of order n are known. It turned out that the Petersen graph minus a vertex is the only non-trivial critical graph on up to 10 vertices. <p> This graph contains a 7-critical subgraph of order at most 9. By the results of <ref> [6] </ref> there are no 7-critical graphs on less than 9 vertices and those of order 9 have one of the following degree sequences: 27 8 , 367 7 , 457 7 , 46 2 7 6 , 5 2 67 6 , 56 3 7 5 and 6 5 7 4 <p> This graph contains an 8-critical subgraph H 0 . By the results of <ref> [6] </ref> H 0 has one of the following degree sequences: 57 3 8 5 ; 6 3 8 6 ; 6 2 7 2 8 5 ; 67 4 8 4 ; 7 6 8 3 , and none of them is extendable to H. <p> Identifying each vertex of degree 2 with one of the degree 5 vertices yields a class 2 graph on ten vertices with degree sequence 7 2 8 8 . As above we obtain a contradiction by applying the results of <ref> [6] </ref>. Thus (G fl ) = 57 3 8 8 in this case. Let V = fv 1 ; v 2 ; v 3 g. Then d G fl (v i ) 4 for all i. Assume d G fl (v 1 ) = 4.

Reference-contexts: We are interested in graphs which are class 2 for structural reasons, and define a critical graph with at most b jV j 2 c edges to be non-trivial.

Nevertheless the critical graph conjecture, independently formulated by Jakobsen <ref> [15] </ref> and Beineke, Wilson [1], claiming that every critical graph has odd order, is false.

Reference-contexts: We used the graph generator makeg <ref> [16] </ref> for this. Since makeg only allows to give an upper bound for the maximum degree, we restricted the generation to graphs with maximum degree at most 8 (there are 112 458 045 313 graphs) and deleted those with maximum degree 3 or 4 (6 800 637 graphs).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A famous theorem of Vizing <ref> [20] </ref> states that the chromatic index 0 (G) of a simple graph G is (G) or (G) + 1, where (G) denotes the maximum vertex degree in G. A graph G is class 1 if 0 (G) = (G) and it is class 2 otherwise.
