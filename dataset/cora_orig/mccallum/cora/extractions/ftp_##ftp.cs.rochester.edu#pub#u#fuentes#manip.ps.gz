Abstract: In this paper we present a kinematic method for 6-degree-of-freedom manipulation of rigid objects using a dextrous robotic hand. Our method does not require prior models of the objects to be manipulated; all the information needed can be obtained directly from the hand's sensors. The method allows arbitrary (within the robot's physical limits) translations and rotations of the object, and its low computational cost makes real-time performance easy to achieve. We present experimental results of manipulation using the Utah/MIT hand [1, 2], a 16-DOF dextrous manipulator, and show that with the addition of a Cartesian controller a high degree of accuracy can be attained.

Reference-contexts: Compliant dextrous hands with many degrees of freedom offer a possible solution to this problem, since their redundancy and compliance can be used to achieve stable grasps in the presence of uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: Although, due to non-zero finger size and other effects, the assumption of fixed contact points is not strictly correct, our experimental results show that the compliance of the Utah/MIT hand compensates for the errors introduced by the use of this assumption. Somewhat similar approaches have been suggested in <ref> [10] </ref> and [11]. In more detail, the formulation is as follows.
