Abstract: The topic of this paper is a project to design an intelligent agent which supports humans in the domain of hazardous site investigation. This software agent will be integrated into wearable technology which is embedded in the protective clothing worn by the humans. An overview of some of the design issues is presented, with a particular emphasis on the visual problem solving component.

Reference-contexts: Applications in areas such as medicine (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>), manufacturing (e.g., [6]) and even clerical work (e.g., [11]) show the great promise of this approach to human-machine interaction. However, many of these systems rely on the complementary notion of "ubiquitous computing," i.e., where objects in the environment are "tagged" electronically (e.g., with barcodes [5]).

Reference-contexts: In the case of disease surveillance, often local medical personnel are recruited, who may not have specialized training in the methodologies needed for standardized monitoring. 2. BACKGROUND While the idea of human-computer symbiosis has been around for almost forty years <ref> [2] </ref>, it is only recently that technology has reached a degree of sophistication that makes this a concrete possibility.

Reference-contexts: The development of augmented reality environments which employ see-through displays and projectors allows the environment to be enriched through "virtual annotation": the physical properties of objects in the environment may be overlayed with electronic enhancements such as outlines and instructions (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Technical approaches to these learning issues include the use of reinforcement learning, a technique which has recently met with success in robotics and situated agent applications <ref> [4] </ref>, case-based learning to capture key aspects of problem solving strategies for new tasks, and theory revision as a mechanism of transferring previously learned knowledge to a new situation without interference to the old tasks.

Reference-contexts: However, many of these systems rely on the complementary notion of "ubiquitous computing," i.e., where objects in the environment are "tagged" electronically (e.g., with barcodes <ref> [5] </ref>). This allows the wearable system to recognize and track objects in the surrounding area, but it restricts usage to fairly static and stable environments.
