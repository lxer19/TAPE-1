Title: Core Migration for Dynamic Multicast Routing

Abstract: Efficient multicast communication provides one of the best avenues for scaling bandwidth intensive applications. Current multicast routing mechanisms perform well for multicast groups which reach a long-term, steady-state distribution of membership. However, when the membership migrates throughout the network, current routing techniques may perform poorly. Recent techniques for IP multicast involve selection of a "core" router through which multicast communication is routed. We propose to adapt this routing scheme to efficiently support dynamic groups, by allowing the core to migrate. As part of our work we provide solutions to several problems that are more general, including (1) estimating multicast tree bandwidth using unicast information and (2) a variation on soliciting responses from a limited number of participants to avoid message implosion.

Reference-contexts: Scenario RC (Relay Chat) The group in this scenario is highly dynamic, with participants being created frequently throughout the network, gen erally lasting a very short period of time. Scenario SM (Seminar) This scenario mimics the membership characteristics of the UCB Multime dia Seminar session <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 We name these scenarios according to applications which we believe may exhibit the given characteristics.

This not only creates additional network load but can lead to message implosion at the candidate cores. Random Participant Evaluation works in the same manner as above except that it utilizes probabilistic multicast <ref> [2] </ref> to control the number of responses sent by participants to each candidate core. The header of the multicast packet contains an acceptance probability, ff, which each participant uses to determine whether or not to respond.

Reference-contexts: Our objective is to develop a mechanism to detect when the current core is performing poorly, and migrate to a better core. The two recently-proposed multicast routing protocols that use a core router are Core-Based Trees (CBT) <ref> [4] </ref> and Protocol Independent Multicast | Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) [9], where the core is called a rendezvous point (RP). Early development of CBT and PIM did not explicitly address the issue of performance-based core choice, assuming an administrative decision, though not precluding more sophisticated selection. <p> Thus, the mechanisms to support migration to a different core have been included in PIM; we concentrate on the question of determining when and where to move the core. The current CBT specification <ref> [4] </ref> references work in progress on a scheme to organize candidate RP or core routers into a multi-level global hierarchy [15]. core The main objective of this scheme is to allow core identity to be transparent to senders and receivers.

We adapt the receiver congestion discovery protocol proposed by Bolot <ref> [5] </ref> to determine the number of receivers. Our algorithm chooses an initial value of ff, and the core sends a probabilistic multicast to the receivers. The initial value of ff is chosen conservatively, allowing for few or no responses. <p> It is somewhat surprising to note that the accuracy is relatively independent of the group size, whereas it depended more on group size for full participation. 4 A timeout of twice the maximum round trip time is used to determine the end of a round. See <ref> [5] </ref> for a description of the round trip time discovery. participation 5 Putting It All Together The full core evaluation algorithm brings together all of the pieces described earlier.

Early development of CBT and PIM did not explicitly address the issue of performance-based core choice, assuming an administrative decision, though not precluding more sophisticated selection. The current PIM specification [9] calls for each multicast group to have an RP list, composed of a "primary RP" and a small number of alternates. Support is provided for a group to switch from the primary to an alternate when the senders or receivers detect that the primary is unreachable. <p> Each candidate core computes the upper bound and sends this as an estimate of bandwidth to the current core. If the current core decides to perform core migration, this occurs using a core change protocol, such as in PIM <ref> [9] </ref>. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method by inspecting the ratio of our estimated multicast bandwidth to the actual multicast bandwidth over randomly generated instances. Figure 2 shows the ratio as a function of the number of receivers.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4 we discuss evaluating core performance by soliciting responses from limited receivers and estimating bandwidth utilization. We present the full migration algorithm in Section 5 and investigate performance on several application models. For more detail, see the full version of this paper <ref> [12] </ref>. 2 Multicast Routing We use a graph G = (V; E; W ) to represent the network, where V is the set of vertices, representing routers or switches, E is the set of edges, representing logical connectivity, and W (u; v) is a function mapping edges to weights (W (u; <p> Thus we propose augmenting the control messages that are part of the multicast protocol to include messages that facilitate core migration (See <ref> [12] </ref> for message details). This allows a candidate core to know the hop count from itself to each participant in the group. 3 Each candidate core then evaluates and reports its cost to the current core. <p> Our analysis demonstrates that the expected first response round and probability of implosion for our technique are better than Bolot's scheme. See <ref> [12] </ref> for complete analysis. Each candidate core must estimate performance given data about the unicast routes between itself and a limited set of group participants. We now must estimate average and maximum delay, in addition to bandwidth, since we do not have the full knowledge necessary to compute exact delays.
