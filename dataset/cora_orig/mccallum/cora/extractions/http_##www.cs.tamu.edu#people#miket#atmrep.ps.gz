Reference-contexts: There are many technical details of the ATM standard which have not crystallized yet <ref> [1] </ref>. Research is still necessary in many key areas, including the following. * Congestion and Flow Control for Broadband ISDN's is an open issue. The extremely high 2 OPEN ATM RESEARCH AREAS 3 bandwidths of ATM networks require the use of preventive control [4] [6] [7] strategies. <p> Traffic policing will be performed in these nodes as in the regular user-to-network interfaces. 4.2 Virtual Path and Virtual Channel Connections The ATM layer of a B-ISDN network has the capability to switch and multiplex cells that belong to different Virtual Channel and Virtual Path Connections <ref> [1] </ref>. Initially, the simulator will support Virtual Path switching, only. When the system has been verified and tested the capability of Virtual Channel Switching will be added on top of the Virtual Paths. An example ATM network with user sites interconnected via Virtual Path Connections is shown in figure 5.

Many subareas of congestion and traffic control are discussed in the following items. * A set of Traffic Descriptors which accurately captures the statistical characteristics of the traffic over the virtual connections need to be determined [4]. Traffic descriptors are specified by a user when a new connection is requested in order to describe the quality of service that should be guaranteed by the network. One descriptor of particular importance is the burstiness of the source traffic. <p> The bursty nature of the traffic carried in ATM networks makes it very difficult to implement an "ideal" bandwidth enforcement mechanism <ref> [4] </ref>. * Reactive congestion and flow control may be applicable to private networks, e.g., in cor porate networks, when link distances are short [8]. * ATM Switch design Many switch architectures have been proposed to switch the ATM traffic. <p> All connections 4 DESIGN AND OPERATION OF ATMSIM 12 that violate their traffic agreements will have the CLPs of their cell set equal to 1. This is the virtual leaky bucket method which is claimed to be more successful than the initially proposed leaky bucket <ref> [4] </ref>. In the future it will be possible to include logic in the user's nodes that can respond to traffic enforcement requests generated by the adjacent ATM switches.

Reference-contexts: A traffic source on a communication network may generate constant traffic at regular time intervals, or generate long "packet-trains" corresponding, for instance, to packetized digital video or audio signal. The traffic in ATM networks is expected to be highly irregular, correlated and bursty <ref> [5] </ref>. All the processes we consider here are of discrete time, that is, the state of the system may change at discrete increments of time t 0 ; t 1 ; : : : ; t n .

Reference-contexts: Bandwidth allocation algorithms for statistically multiplexed channels should be able to determine the number of connections to accept and at the same time ensure an "engineerable" the management of congestion. It is generally agreed that allocating bandwidth, even considering Virtual Paths only, is a complicated problem <ref> [13] </ref>. * Bandwidth Enforcement is a mechanism in the network that monitors the actual traffic volume that is injected by the users into the network. Excessive cells are either discarded or marked as violating the traffic agreement of the connection.
