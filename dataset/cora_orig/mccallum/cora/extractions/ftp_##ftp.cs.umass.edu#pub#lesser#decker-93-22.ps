Title: Analyzing the Need for Meta-Level Communication  
Abstract: Keith S. Decker and Victor R. Lesser Technical Report 93-22 (IJCAI-93 + AAAI-93) UMass Computer Science Technical Report 93-22 May 1, 1995 Abstract In naturally distributed, homogeneous, cooperative problem solving environments where well-defined tasks arrive at multiple locations, decisions must be made about the extent of, and overlap between, each agent's area of responsibilitythe agents' organization. The organization may be constructed statically by a system designer, or dynamically by the agents during problem solving. No one organization is optimal across environments or even specific problem solving instances [6, 7, 8]. This paper presents an analysis of static and dynamic organizational structures for this class of environments, exemplified by distributed sensor networks. We first show how the performance of any static organization can be statistically described, and then show under what conditions dynamic organizations do better and worse than static ones. Finally, we show how the variance in the agents' performance leads to uncertainty about whether a dynamic organization will perform better than a static one given only agent a priori expectations. In these cases, we show when meta-level communication about the actual state of problem solving will be useful to agents in constructing a dynamic organizational structure that outperforms a static one. Viewed in its entirety, this paper also presents a methodology for answering questions about the design of distributed problem solving systems by analysis and simulation of the characteristics of a complex environment rather than by relying on single-instance examples.

Reference-contexts: Agents can perform three actions: method execution, communication, and information gathering. The control component of an agent determines the next action an agent will perform based on the agent's current set of beliefs <ref> [1, 13] </ref>. A method execution action, of method M , that is begun at time t will conclude at time t+d (M; t).

Reference-contexts: Previous approaches to analyzing organizations in distributed sensor networks have either not focused on the effectiveness of the organization <ref> [2, 12] </ref>, or have only analyzed organizational effectiveness in particular, single-instance examples [7]. Our approach is to model the task environment mathematically, using a formalism developed specifically to study distributed coordination and scheduling [5].

Reference-contexts: When local or non-local effects exist between tasks that are known by more than one agent, they become coordination relationships <ref> [4, 3] </ref>. The basic purpose of the objective model is to formally specify how the execution and timing of tasks affect quality and duration. <p> The addition of correlated noise in the environment can then cause these new, more complex coordination mechanisms to break down, producing the phenomenon recognized as distraction. In the long term, we are working towards a complete characterization of generalized partial global planning <ref> [3] </ref> as a first step towards a theory of coordination in distributed problem solving. We and other researchers are also using our task structure characterization for the analysis and simulation of problems in real-time and parallel scheduling.

Reference-contexts: Section 2.5 will detail what the structure of each task group is for the DSN simulation. 1 In general there are usually more complex interrelationships between subtasks that affect scheduling decisions, such as facilitation <ref> [4] </ref>. 2 This specification is applicable to other interesting environments. For example: each task group may comprise several different types of subtasks; each agent may only respond to a certain type of subtask (its `range'); multiple agents may respond to the same types (`overlap'). <p> When local or non-local effects exist between tasks that are known by more than one agent, they become coordination relationships <ref> [4, 3] </ref>. The basic purpose of the objective model is to formally specify how the execution and timing of tasks affect quality and duration. <p> Other work has considered the case of facilitation, a non-local effect where the availability of a result from one task alters the quality and duration of another task, but the non-communication of a result has no effect <ref> [4] </ref>. This work considers a different relationship, precedence. <p> The coordination algorithm described here works with the local scheduling algorithm described earlier in Section 4.1. This is consistent with our view of coordination as a modulating behavior <ref> [4] </ref>. The only modification to the local scheduler is that we prevent it from scheduling local method execution actions until our initial communications are completed (the initial and reception phases, described below). The coordination algorithm is then as follows. <p> In the short term, this work leads to the explanation of other interesting distributed problem solving phenomena displayed in [7]. The addition of noise at DSN sensors leads to the necessity of more complex coordination with the introduction of more complex task interrelationships (such as facilitation <ref> [4] </ref>). The addition of correlated noise in the environment can then cause these new, more complex coordination mechanisms to break down, producing the phenomenon recognized as distraction.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is to model the task environment mathematically, using a formalism developed specifically to study distributed coordination and scheduling <ref> [5] </ref>. We then develop expressions for the expected efficiencies of static and dynamic organizational structures, in terms of the cost of communication and time to complete a given set of tasks. Finally, we validate these mathematical models by using simulations. <p> We have developed a characterization of task environments that formally captures the range of features, processes, and especially interrelationships that occur during computationally intensive coordination and scheduling <ref> [5] </ref>. The model of environmental and task characteristics we propose has three levels: objective, subjective, and generative; the subjective level is not discussed here. The objective level describes the essential structure of a particular problem-solving situation or instance over time.

Our approach is to model the task environment mathematically, using a formalism developed specifically to study distributed coordination and scheduling [5]. <p> The key to static structures is to divide up the overlap area a priori (rather than to penalize agents for doing redundant work in the overlap area <ref> [7] </ref>). The key to dynamic organizational structures is to transfer tasks so that all the agents' resources are used efficiently. <p> From the viewpoint of the distributed AI community, we have returned to look at the some of the problems first studied by Durfee, Lesser, and Corkill <ref> [7] </ref>. They concluded that Our intent is to show that overly specialized organizational structures allow effective network performance in particular problem-solving situations, but that no 17 such organization is appropriate in all situations. <p> In such a methodology, the observation of particular phenomena in a complex system (the DVMT) leads to the building and verification of general models that predict and explain such phenomena. In the short term, this work leads to the explanation of other interesting distributed problem solving phenomena displayed in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Organizational theorists have long held that the organization of a set of agents cannot be analyzed separately from the agents' task environment, that there is no single best organization for all environments, and that different organizations are not equally effective in a given environment <ref> [8] </ref>. Most of these theorists view the uncertainties present in the environment as a key characteristic, though they differ in the mechanisms that link environmental uncertainty to effective organization.

Reference-contexts: The durations of all tasks were set at 1 time unit, as were the duration of information gathering and communication actions; we will demonstrate and discuss the effect of this assumption later in the paper. We used the simulation validation statistic suggested by Kleijnen <ref> [9] </ref> (where ^y = the predicted output by the analytical model and y = the output of the simulation): z = (Var (y) + Var (^y)) 1=2 where Var (^y) is the predicted variance. 6 The result z can then be tested for significance against the standard normal tables.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we use both of these concepts to analyze potential organizational structures for a class of naturally distributed, homogeneous, cooperative problem solving environments where tasks arrive at multiple locations, exemplified by distributed sensor networks <ref> [10] </ref>. Previous approaches to analyzing organizations in distributed sensor networks have either not focused on the effectiveness of the organization [2, 12], or have only analyzed organizational effectiveness in particular, single-instance examples [7]. <p> Throughout each section, we will illustrate and confirm the analytical results experimentally, using as an example a simulated distributed sensor network similar to the Distributed Vehicle Monitoring Testbed (DVMT) <ref> [10] </ref>. 2 Task Environment Model Our task environment model of naturally distributed problems assumes that several independent groups of tasks arrive at multiple locations over a period of time called an episode.
