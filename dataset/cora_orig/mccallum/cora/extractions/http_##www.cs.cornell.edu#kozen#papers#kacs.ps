Abstract: Kleene algebras are an important class of algebraic structures that arise in diverse areas of computer science: program logic and semantics, relational algebra, automata theory, and the design and analysis of algorithms. The literature contains several inequivalent definitions of Kleene algebras and related algebraic structures [2, 14, 15, 5, 6, 1, 10, 7]. In this paper we establish some new relationships among these structures. Our main results are:

They have been used to model programs in Dynamic Logic [14, 5], to prove the equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata <ref> [2, 1] </ref>, to give fast algorithms for transitive closure and shortest paths in directed graphs [1, 10], and to axiomatize relational algebra [11, 12, 15]. There has been some disagreement regarding the proper definition of Kleene algebras. <p> There has been some disagreement regarding the proper definition of Kleene algebras. At least ten inequivalent definitions of Kleene algebras or related structures have appeared in the literature <ref> [2, 14, 15, 5, 6] </ref>, all serving roughly the same purpose. It is important to understand the relationships between these classes in order to extract the axiomatic essence of Kleene algebra. Perhaps it is not too unreasonable to hope that we might one day converge on a standard definition. <p> It is shown in [6] that these axioms completely characterize the algebra of regular events, giving a finitary axiomatization of that equational theory and thus improving Salomaa's completeness theorem [16]. A similar (and in fact stronger) theorem is stated by Conway without proof <ref> [2, p. 108] </ref>; but to his knowledge [3] and the author's, no proof has ever appeared in the literature. A Kleene algebra is called fl -continuous if it satisfies the axiom ab fl c = n where P refers to the supremum in the natural order . <p> In fact, in the treatment of [1, 10], the sole purpose of P seems to be to define fl . A more descriptive name for closed semirings might be !-complete idempotent semirings. These algebras are strongly related to several classes of algebras defined by Conway in his 1971 monograph <ref> [2] </ref>. Conway's S-algebras are similar to closed semirings, except that arbitrary sums, not just countable ones, are permitted. A better name for S-algebras might be complete idempotent semirings. <p> The N-algebras are algebras of signature (+; ; fl ; 0; 1) that are subsets of S-algebras containing 0 and 1 and closed under (finite) +, , and fl . Combining results of [5] and <ref> [2, Theorem 1, p. 102] </ref>, it can be shown that the classes of N-algebras and fl -continuous Kleene algebras coincide. An R-algebra is any algebra of signature (+; ; fl ; 0; 1) satisfying the equational theory of the N-algebras. <p> We complete the picture by constructing a Kleene algebra that is not fl - continuous. Such an algebra must necessarily be infinite, since all finite Kleene algebras are fl -continuous. * Conway gives a construction that embeds every fl -continuous Kleene algebra in an S-algebra <ref> [2, Theorem 1, p. 102] </ref>. This construction can be described as a completion by fl -ideals. <p> The functor from KA fl to CS can be described as a completion by countably generated fl -ideals. * We show that the axioms for Kleene algebra [6] are not complete for the universal Horn theory of the regular events. This refutes a conjecture of Conway <ref> [2, p. 103] </ref>. 2 * We show that right-handed Kleene algebras do not have to be left-handed. This verifies a weaker version of a conjecture of Pratt [15]. <p> It was shown in [6] that the Kleene algebra axioms completely axiomatize the algebra of regular events. In other words, Reg is the free Kleene algebra on free generators . Conway <ref> [2, Theorem 5, p. 108] </ref> claimed without proof that the axioms for right-handed Kleene algebra completely axiomatize the algebra of regular events, but to his knowledge [3] and the author's, no proof has ever appeared in the literature. <p> In x3 we will construct a Kleene algebra that is not fl -continuous. The n fi n matrices over a Kleene algebra again form a Kleene algebra [6]. 2.1.2 Elementary Properties of Kleene Algebras We list here some elementary consequences of the Kleene algebra axioms. See <ref> [2, 15, 6] </ref> for proofs. In any Kleene algebra K, the relation is a partial order, and K is an upper semilattice with join + and minimum element 0. <p> The operation fl is the constant 0 function. As with Kleene algebras, the n fi n matrices over a closed semiring again form a closed semiring. 6 2.3 Conway's Algebras According to the definition in <ref> [2] </ref>, an S-algebra (S; ; ; 0; 1) is similar to a closed semiring, except that P is defined not on sequences but on multisets of elements of S; moreover, there is no cardinality restriction on the multiset (thus P big to be represented in ZF set theory!). <p> So defined, P A gives the supremum of A with respect to the order . (We assume the axiom P fag = a, which is omitted in <ref> [2] </ref>.) Thus, the only essential difference between S-algebras and closed semirings is that closed semirings are only required to contain suprema of countable sets, whereas S-algebras must contain suprema of all sets. <p> fl -continuous Recall the definitions of the categories category objects morphisms SA S-algebras continuous semiring morphisms CS closed semirings !-continuous semiring morphisms KA fl fl -continuous Kleene algebras Kleene algebra morphisms KA Kleene algebras Kleene algebra morphisms RA R-algebras maps preserving +, , fl , 0, 1 From results of <ref> [2, 6, 5] </ref>, the equational theories of all these algebras coincide. The following inclusions are also known: SA CS KA fl KA RA : All inclusions were known to be strict except KA fl KA. <p> The following inclusions are also known: SA CS KA fl KA RA : All inclusions were known to be strict except KA fl KA. Conway <ref> [2, p. 102] </ref> gives a four-element R-algebra R 4 that is not a fl -continuous Kleene algebra. It is easily shown that all finite Kleene algebras are fl -continuous, thus R 4 is not a Kleene algebra either. <p> In <ref> [2, Theorem 1, p. 102] </ref>, Conway gives a construction that shows that every fl -continuous Kleene algebra is embedded in an S-algebra. This construction can be described as a completion by fl -ideals. <p> The construction C, which shows that every fl -continuous Kleene algebra is embedded in a closed semiring, can be described as a completion by countably generated fl -ideals. 4.1 Kleene algebras and closed semirings Definition 1 (Conway <ref> [2] </ref>) Let K be a fl -continuous Kleene algebra. <p> This map will be the unit of our adjunction. If all references to countability are removed from the foregoing construction, we get an embedding of K into an S-algebra consisting of (not necessarily countably generated) fl -ideals. This gives a proof of <ref> [2, Theorem 1, p. 102] </ref>. We now wish to establish an adjunction between KA fl and CS. The first matter at hand is to establish a bijection between the homsets K ! KC and CK ! C for a fl -continuous Kleene algebra K and closed semiring C. <p> This refutes a conjecture of Conway <ref> [2, p. 103] </ref>. 16 Consider the equational implication a 2 = 1 ! a = 1 : This formula is true in Reg for all values of a; in other words, for any regular event A, if A 2 = f*g then A = f*g.

Reference-contexts: They have been used to model programs in Dynamic Logic [14, 5], to prove the equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata [2, 1], to give fast algorithms for transitive closure and shortest paths in directed graphs [1, 10], and to axiomatize relational algebra <ref> [11, 12, 15] </ref>. There has been some disagreement regarding the proper definition of Kleene algebras. At least ten inequivalent definitions of Kleene algebras or related structures have appeared in the literature [2, 14, 15, 5, 6], all serving roughly the same purpose. <p> There has been some disagreement regarding the proper definition of Kleene algebras. At least ten inequivalent definitions of Kleene algebras or related structures have appeared in the literature <ref> [2, 14, 15, 5, 6] </ref>, all serving roughly the same purpose. It is important to understand the relationships between these classes in order to extract the axiomatic essence of Kleene algebra. Perhaps it is not too unreasonable to hope that we might one day converge on a standard definition. <p> Combining results of [5] and [2, Theorem 1, p. 102], it can be shown that the classes of N-algebras and fl -continuous Kleene algebras coincide. An R-algebra is any algebra of signature (+; ; fl ; 0; 1) satisfying the equational theory of the N-algebras.

Generalizations of Kleene's and Parikh's Theorems have been given by Kuich [7] in `- complete semirings, which are similar to S-algebras in all respects except that idempotence of is replaced by a weaker condition called `-completeness. <p> This refutes a conjecture of Conway [2, p. 103]. 2 * We show that right-handed Kleene algebras do not have to be left-handed. This verifies a weaker version of a conjecture of Pratt <ref> [15] </ref>. Pratt's conjecture referred to Boolean semirings (yet another related structure) in which the natural order comes from a Boolean algebra. 2 Definitions 2.1 Kleene Algebras For the purposes of this paper, we adopt the definition of [6]. <p> In x3 we will construct a Kleene algebra that is not fl -continuous. The n fi n matrices over a Kleene algebra again form a Kleene algebra [6]. 2.1.2 Elementary Properties of Kleene Algebras We list here some elementary consequences of the Kleene algebra axioms. See <ref> [2, 15, 6] </ref> for proofs. In any Kleene algebra K, the relation is a partial order, and K is an upper semilattice with join + and minimum element 0. <p> It is an open problem to give a complete axiomatization of the universal Horn theory of the regular events. 6 Right-handed Kleene algebras are not necessarily left-handed Recall the right- and left-handed Kleene algebra rules ax x ! a fl x x (3) In <ref> [15] </ref>, Pratt asks whether these two rules are equivalent, and conjectures that they are not. His conjecture actually refers to the more specific case of Boolean monoids, in which comes from a Boolean algebra. However, the question makes sense in the more general context of Kleene algebras. <p> In this section we construct a right-handed Kleene algebra that is not left handed; this answers Pratt's question in the more general case of Kleene algebras and provides evidence in favor of his conjecture. The conjecture as stated in <ref> [15] </ref> is still open.

Reference-contexts: It is shown in [6] that these axioms completely characterize the algebra of regular events, giving a finitary axiomatization of that equational theory and thus improving Salomaa's completeness theorem <ref> [16] </ref>. A similar (and in fact stronger) theorem is stated by Conway without proof [2, p. 108]; but to his knowledge [3] and the author's, no proof has ever appeared in the literature. <p> The equational theory of this structure is called the algebra of regular events. This theory was axiomatized by Salomaa <ref> [16] </ref>, but his axiomatization involved rules that were not sound in general when interpreted over other Kleene algebras. It was shown in [6] that the Kleene algebra axioms completely axiomatize the algebra of regular events. In other words, Reg is the free Kleene algebra on free generators .
