Abstract: This paper discusses the Freeway Service Patrol (FSP) Evaluation Project conducted under the California PATH program. The goal of this project was to determine the cost effectiveness of the FSP program along a ten-mile "beat" on I-880, near Hayward, California. We collected data from three different sources: loop detector data, probe vehicle data, and incident log data. We describe these sources in detail and the problems that were encountered with them. We also discuss the support programs developed to process this data, and the efforts to place the data and the programs online for use by researchers around the country.
