Abstract: GIT-CC-97/14 http://www.cc.gatech.edu/tech reports/ Abstract Cable plants were initially designed for one-way broadcast communication (from the head-end to the neighborhood). They are now being upgraded to provide an upstream path (from the home to the head-end). New challenges arise in using the upstream channel since the available bandwidth is low and the noise levels are high. In this paper we present a MAC protocol especially designed to efficiently share the scarce upstream capacity. The protocol dynamically adjusts operating parameters to the current workload on the system. The control mechanism does not require any framing structure and is built around a "sea of mini-slots". The performance under both static and highly dynamic loads is close to optimum. The station implementation is particularly simple and the downstream control structure is also simple. Results are given here for fixed length data units (ATM cells) but the algorithm extends very simply to variable length MAC frames. fl School of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Reference-contexts: Since this capacity is shared between many stations it is important that it be used efficiently. It is the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol that ensures the fair and efficient use of the channel. 2 A number of MAC protocols have been proposed for cable data communication <ref> [1] </ref> and they are mostly a variation of the reservation ALOHA protocol [2, 3].

Note that if short cells are being transmitted (e.g. 53 byte ATM cells) then the size of a reservation slot can be a significant fraction of a data cell, due to the overhead associated with transmitting a message.

CPR <ref> [3] </ref> was designed as a centralized scheme with a very simple station protocol. Low cost is one of the main goals in this design. Therefore, as much functionality as possible is moved to the head-end. The CPR station is largely transparent to the control algorithms deployed in the head-end. <p> It is possible to reach a utilization of 72%, with large delay of the order of 2700 mini-slots. For comparison, curve c shows the performance of Type 2 traffic with piggybacking. In a fixed-slot structure piggybacking improves the maximum throughput as well as the access delay <ref> [3] </ref>. In a variable slot structure, the contention bandwidth is so high at low and medium loads that piggybacking is rarely used. It only helps at loads that are higher than the contention channel can carry. <p> The first is the extreme simplicity of the station protocol and the relative simplicity of the head-end protocol. The focus on simple station design is an extension of previous work where this issue was examined more fully in <ref> [3] </ref>. There are indirect benefits of simplicity such as having to deal with fewer possible error conditions. An examination of the robustness of CPR was made in [3]. <p> The focus on simple station design is an extension of previous work where this issue was examined more fully in <ref> [3] </ref>. There are indirect benefits of simplicity such as having to deal with fewer possible error conditions. An examination of the robustness of CPR was made in [3]. There are essentially two additional signals that are transmitted from the head-end to the station relative to CPR; the value of p and the indication of mini-slot/data slot.

Reference-contexts: If a collision occurs in a contention slot then the station receives no acknowledgment from the head-end and a contention resolution algorithm (CRA) is used to resolve the collision. The CRA could be p-persistence (as in Aloha), or a tree-based algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. Most CRAs require a knowledge of the number of stations competing for a slot to work most effectively. An algorithm to estimate this number is required. <p> As we shall see in our discussion of the Contention Slot Allocator (CSA), it is more difficult to use optimally the contention slots when the network has non-zero delay. 3.4 Optimal use of the Contention Mini-Slots Several CRAs have been proposed in the past for multiple access systems <ref> [4, 17] </ref>. We have chosen to work with the p-persistence based algorithms mainly due to their simplicity and ease of implementation. The simple p-persistence algorithm, using a fixed retransmission probability p, is shown to be unstable [17].

Reference-contexts: A typical upstream frame structure is shown in Fig. 2. A group of data slots and contention mini-slots (CMSs) constitute a frame. The length of a frame may vary with traffic load <ref> [5] </ref> and/or the number of CMSs within a frame may be varied. As far as we are aware all adaptive protocols so far explored use some type of framing and clustering of slots. We refer to them collectively as frame-based algorithms. <p> additional access delay in the system (the station just points to the correct memory location in the buffer to recognized the type of the next mini-slot required). 3.2 Sea of Mini-Slots The performance of a protocol depends more on the framing structure employed than the details of the CRA algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. We have assumed that there is no frame structure used in the scheduling of data traffic 2 . At the lowest level there is just a sequence of mini-slots.

Reference-contexts: For this reason we pay particular attention to the dynamic performance in this paper. There has been very little work on characterizing the dynamic performance of MAC protocols (See <ref> [6] </ref> for one dynamic test) and so we propose an impulse response test. A last measure that we focus on, more conceptually than quantitatively, is the idea of simplicity of implementation.

Reference-contexts: We have chosen a frameless structure in which CMSs are inserted continuously as they are required using what we refer to as the contention-slot allocator (CSA). Contention resolution is by means of a p-persistence algorithm. 2 Previous Work The first MAC protocol proposed for HFC systems was (X)DQRAP <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. XDQRAP is a distributed scheme with the head-end reflecting the information arriving from the upstream channel to the downstream channel. Stations independently control access to the medium by monitoring the downstream channel. The CRA used is a type of tree algorithm. <p> In contrast to the padding approach typically used 1 <ref> [7] </ref>, this extra storage does not introduce any additional access delay in the system (the station just points to the correct memory location in the buffer to recognized the type of the next mini-slot required). 3.2 Sea of Mini-Slots The performance of a protocol depends more on the framing structure employed

Reference-contexts: Therefore, as much functionality as possible is moved to the head-end. The CPR station is largely transparent to the control algorithms deployed in the head-end. It does not require knowledge of any framing that may be used by the head-end (e.g. frames used in support of CBR traffic <ref> [9] </ref>). All subsequent proposals adopt the centralized approach but impose different frame structures. UniLINK [10] divides the frame into three regions: contention, reserved and periodic reserved (to support stream traffic). The boundaries that delimit the regions are dynamically adjusted depending on the load. <p> It virtually moves the physical location of the station to the EOL by adding some physical delay. This delay increases, by a proportional amount, the minimum access delay of the system. 2 There could well be a frame structure used for the transmission of periodic traffic as described in <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The slot structure of the next frame is broadcast in the previous frame, specifying for every slot the type, and if it is reserved, the length, owner and offset location within the frame. It uses a tree-based CRA with free access for new comers (msSTART <ref> [13] </ref>). The Zenith protocol [14, 15] defines three regions in a fixed length frame. Two of these regions are used for contention: one that can be used for any contending station; and another region reserved for those stations that have already collided at least once. <p> For this frame length, the access delay at low loads is 2 round-trips as against the one round-trip delay for the frameless implementation. The access delays in practical frame-based systems may be 3 round-trips or even higher. Additional delay can be introduced by particular block-oriented CRA implementations <ref> [13] </ref>, or by the frame control mechanisms which can sometimes require a station to skip the frame in which it receives the feedback before transmitting in the data portion of the subsequent frame.

Reference-contexts: As the load increases further, reservations may be made via the piggyback channel and hence the number of CMSs required will decrease. The solution to determining how many CMSs to allocate is rather simple: allocate all slots that are not being used for data as CMSs <ref> [16] </ref>. At low load many more CMSs will be allocated than are required. The surplus of CMSs reduces the probability of collision to a very low level which in turn reduces the access delay for the data 5 . <p> One way to address this problem is to admit stations throughout the cycle using a p-persistence like algorithm <ref> [16] </ref>.

Since neither the head-end nor the individual stations are capable of determining N a exactly estimation algorithms are used. We use here the standard pseudo-Bayesian estimation algorithm proposed by Rivest [17]. In this scheme, unlike conventional slotted Aloha, a station having new arrivals is treated the same as a backlogged station immediately on arrival. The Rivest algorithm operates by estimating the number of users (stations) waiting to transmit their requests at the beginning of each CMS.
