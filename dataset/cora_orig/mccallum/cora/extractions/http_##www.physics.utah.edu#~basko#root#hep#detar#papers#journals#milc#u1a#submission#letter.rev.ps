Abstract: Sigma models for the high temperature phase transition in quantum chro-modynamics (QCD) suggest that at high temperature the SU(N f ) fi SU (N f ) chiral symmetry becomes exact, but the anomalous axial U(1) symmetry need not be restored. In numerical lattice simulations, traditional methods for detecting symmetry restoration have sought multiplets in the screening mass spectrum. However, these methods were imprecise and the results, so far, incomplete. With improved statistics and methodology, we are now able to offer evidence for a restoration of the SU (2) fi SU (2) chiral symmetry just

Reference-contexts: Sigma models suggest that in the limit of zero up and down quark masses, the SU (2) fi SU (2) chiral symmetry is exact in the high temperature phase <ref> [1] </ref>, and a phase transition separates it from a cold phase in which this symmetry is spontaneously broken. The gauge anomaly, present at low temperature, may persist at high temperature, however, breaking the U (1) axial symmetry at all temperatures.

Reference-contexts: The gauge anomaly, present at low temperature, may persist at high temperature, however, breaking the U (1) axial symmetry at all temperatures. Early efforts to detect symmetry restoration looked for chiral multiplets in the screening mass spectrum <ref> [2] </ref>. For example, the following channels are related according to the indicated symmetries: SU (2) fi SU (2) ! U (1) A f 0 The screening mass spectrum is found from the space-like hadron propagators.

Reference-contexts: In early simulations, therefore, it was common to keep only connected graphs. This practice, applied to the f 0 , results instead in a determination of the screening mass for the J P = 0 + I = 1 a 0 meson (also known as 3 Z the ffi) <ref> [3] </ref>. This meson is the axial U (1) chiral partner of the pion.

Reference-contexts: Since our analysis treats only one lattice spacing, namely a 1=(6T c ), further study will be required to distinguish between effects of the lattice approximation and continuum effects of the gauge anomalies. A preliminary report of our results was presented at Lattice '96 <ref> [5] </ref>. A number of other groups have also taken up this question and have also reported preliminary results [6-8]. 4 Z II.

Reference-contexts: If we stick with only the four flavors forced upon us by fermion doubling in the staggered fermion scheme, all isospin components of the a 0 meson are generated by a nonlocal fermion 5 bilinear <ref> [10] </ref>. However, at the expense of increasing the flavor degeneracy to eight, we can create an a 0 analog from a diagonal fermion bilinear operator.
