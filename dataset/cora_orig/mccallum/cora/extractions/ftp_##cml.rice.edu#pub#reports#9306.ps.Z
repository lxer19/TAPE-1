Abstract: We present a wavelet multigrid preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method which gives an efficient solver for the linear system arising from a wavelet-Galerkin discretization of a Dirichlet boundary-value problem via a penalty/fictitious domain formulation. The pre-conditioner is chosen to be a wavelet-based multigrid method for solving the same elliptic equation, however over the fictitious domain and with periodic boundary conditions. Numerical experiments described in the paper confirm the efficiency of this new iterative solver.

Reference-contexts: Using general results on penalty methods proved in, e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>, Chapter 1, we can easily show that u * converges to ~u in H 1 (), where ~u is the H 1 ()- extension of the solution of the following variational problem: ~u 2 H 1 p , ~u = g Z ~ f v dx p , such that <p> -norm inside ! as * ! 0 and L ! 1: On the boundary @!; we note that for all L; u *;L = g + C* where the constant C depends only on the norm of jju * jj H 1 which is uniformly bounded in *; see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To solve the discrete problem, we have developed multilevel methods; the dis-cretization step-size independent convergence rate of these methods can be proved by techniques closely related to those used for finite difference and finite element approximations (see, e.g. <ref> [8] </ref> and [17] for related references). A crucial tool for studying the multilevel solution of the wavelet-based approximate problems is the Mallat transformation described in e.g. [12]. Here, the Mallat transformation plays the fundamental role of prolongation and restriction between the consecutive levels. <p> However, it can be solved in an efficient manner if one considers its compact form (3.6) and uses the circulant structure of the matrix c 0 . 3.3 Convergence Analysis To prove the ffi L -independent convergence of MGM (3.13), we follow the the ory of Hackbusch <ref> [8] </ref>, and for this, we need the following notation. For simplicity we denote X k := X k () := V p k ; (3:14) and we will call X k the (finite-dimensional) periodic scaling space of level k ap proximating H 1 p (). <p> We use P k ; R k to denote such operators for the space X k and we let kP k k, kR k k denote the Euclidean norm of these finite-dimensional operators. In order to be able to adapt the proofs in Section 6.3 in <ref> [8] </ref>, we supply the following lemma. <p> k , k : By taking Lemma 3.1 into account, the approximation property kA 1 k A 1 k ; 0 k L; where C A is a constant being independent of ffi k , follows readily from the standard proof for the finite element case, see Proposition 6.3.14 in <ref> [8] </ref>. Here and later k k denotes the Euclidean norm. Consequently, we have the following theorem, cf. Section 7.2 of [8]. <p> 0 k L; where C A is a constant being independent of ffi k , follows readily from the standard proof for the finite element case, see Proposition 6.3.14 in <ref> [8] </ref>. Here and later k k denotes the Euclidean norm. Consequently, we have the following theorem, cf. Section 7.2 of [8]. Theorem 3.3 Let M mg L (-1 ; -2 ) denote the iteration matrix of an MGM (3.13) for a V-cycle with -1 presmoothing, -2 postsmoothing steps and with a BIM chosen to be a sufficiently strong damped Jacobi iteration. <p> To overcome this divergence one could try to apply a multigrid method with a block version of a BIM where one block is formed by the unkowns corresponding to the boundary @!, as suggested in <ref> [8] </ref>. However, the implementation of this approach depends strongly on the shape of the domain !, a drawback we would like to avoid.

Reference-contexts: Here fi is a suitable damping factor. In our applications we will choose fi sufficiently small such that the resulting Jacobi method is a symmetric iteration <ref> [9] </ref>. Now, we describe the recursive periodic multigrid procedure (MGP) for this periodic case. For this procedure we consider a range of levels with 0 being the coarsest and L &gt; 0 being the finest level. <p> To derive an efficient solver (in terms of performance and convenient coding) we study the condition number of the matrix A L;* := A L + * 1 M L because (A L;* ) determines the convergence speed of the cg-method applied to (4.5), see e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>. We have that (A L;* ) = O (ffi 2 L * 1 ) and remembering that we have chosen * t ffi 2 L above, * 1 affects the condition number most. 11 In a first step we therefore try to eliminate the influence of *. <p> In using the cg-method to solve (4.7) only the action of W 1 L on a vector v has to be computed, see e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>, which can be realized by one step of the multigrid iteration (3.13) with starting guess zero and right hand side v.
