Abstract: A few cases are known where the computational analogue of some basic information theoretical results is much harder to prove or even not known to hold. A notable example is Yao's XOR Lemma. Actually, even Direct Sum Conjectures can be viewed as analogues of trivial probabilistic facts. Here we present yet another example of this phenumena. Unlike the examples mentioned above, here we dont We start with an Information Theoretic formulation of a protocol problem and next we present a protocol (taken from [3, 2]) which solves it. The open problem we suggest refers to the computational properties of this protocol (or protocol problem). know whether even a weak version of the computational analogue holds.

Reference-contexts: Recall that the statistical difference between two random variable X and Y is 2 ff jProb (X = ff) Prob (Y = ff)j We say that X is "-away from Y if the statistical difference between them is ". Proposition 1 Let n be an integer, " 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and m def = n 4 log 2 (n="). Suppose that H n;m is a family of almost n-wise independent hashing functions. <p> We stress that the conditions of Section 1 requite a constant-round public-coin protocol and so the Interactive Hashing protocol of [4] and Coin Tossing into the well <ref> [1] </ref> are ruled-out.

Reference-contexts: 1 The Random Selection Problem The motivation for the following problem comes from [3] (cf., <ref> [2] </ref>), but can be ignored. We seek a randomized two-party protocol for selecting strings. The two parties to the protocol are called the challenger and the responder. These names are supposed to reflect the asymmetric requirements (presented below) as well as the usage of the protocol. <p> This property, restricted to the case in which the responder follows the instruction specified by the protocol, is important for the application in <ref> [3, 2] </ref>. As in the proof of the last two propositions, it suffices to consider an arbitrary deterministic challenger strategy, denoted c. Suppose that H n;m = H t n;m is a family of hashing functions satisfying property (P1), for some t = poly (n).

One motivation for the above question is that it is related to showing that the transformation presented in <ref> [3] </ref> is applicable to argument systems and proof of knowledge. However, for this purpose one would need even stronger results. One generalization (which suffices only for 1-round zero-knowledge protocols) is to replace f by a relation R.
