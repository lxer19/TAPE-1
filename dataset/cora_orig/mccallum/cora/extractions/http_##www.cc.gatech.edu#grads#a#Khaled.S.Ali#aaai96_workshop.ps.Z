Abstract: Traditional AI methods for navigational planning use qualitative spatial representations and reasoning. Traditional robotics techniques for this task are based on numerical representations and reasoning. Recent work on robotics posits mechanisms for reactive control that directly map perceptions of the world to actions on it. This in turn has given rise to hybrid robot architectures that combine navigational planning and reactive control. But following traditional robotics techniques, navigational planning in these hybrid architectures too uses numerical methods. This raises the following question: Given a hybrid robot architecture, are numerical methods really needed for navigational planning? To explore this issue, we integrated a multistrategy qualitative navigational planner with a reactive-control mechanism. Then we embodied the integrated system on a physical robot. Next we gave the robot a series of navigation tasks in a visually structured spatial world containing discrete pathways, and monitored its actions as it executed the tasks in the presence of both static and moving obstacles. Our experiments show that for hybrid robots qualitative methods are sufficient for navigational planning in at least one class of spatial worlds. Spatial navigation is a classical problem in AI and robotics. Traditional AI methods for spatial navigation rely on deliberative planning based on qualitative spatial representations and reasoning [Davis 1986]. For example, STRIPS [Fikes and Nilsson 1971; Fikes, Hart and Nilsson 1972] combined the methods of means-ends analysis and theorem proving to form qualitative plans. Its spatial representations captured topological relationships between spatial regions (e.g., rooms) fl This work has benefited from many discussions with members of the AI and Robotics groups at Georgia Institute of Technology. We are especially grateful to Ron Arkin for allowing us to play with AuRA and Stimpy. This research has been partially supported by a CER infrastructure grant from the National Science Foundation (CCR-86-19886), and research grants from the National Science Foundation (IRI-92-10925) and the Office of Naval Research (N00014-92-J-1234). Traditional robotics techniques for spatial navigation too rely on deliberative planning. But in contrast to AI methods, robotics techniques for navigational planning are based on numerical representations and reasoning [Latombe 1991]. This is because, the argument runs, the movement of a robot needs to be computed with an accuracy and precision that is beyond qualitative representations and reasoning: accurate navigation from an initial location to a goal location requires numerical measures such as the precise distance the robot needs to traverse and the precise direction in which it needs to travel. This sets up the research question for our work:
