Abstract: Since the first shape-from-shading technique was developed by Horn in the early 1970s, different approaches have been continuously emerging in the past two decades. Some of them improve existing techniques, while others are completely new approaches. However, there is no literature on the comparison and performance analysis of these techniques. This is exactly what is addressed in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Their initial algorithm [4] required priori depth information for all the singular points. A later extension [16] could determine this information automatically by assuming twice differentiable depth, isolated singular points and nonzero curvature at singular points. Following the main idea of D&O's approach, Bichsel and Pentland (B&P) <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a minimum downhill approach for SFS which converged in less than ten iterations. Among the local approaches, two are by Pentland, one by Lee and Rosenfeld (L&R), and one by Tsai and Shah (T&S). Pentland [17] recovered shape information from the intensity, and its first and second derivatives.

Reference-contexts: The shape was computed by minimizing an energy function which consists of the above two constraints. Also using these same constraints, Brooks and Horn (B&H) <ref> [2] </ref> minimized the same energy function, in terms of surface normal instead of surface gradient. Frankot and Chellappa [5] enforced the integrability in B&H's algorithm in order to recover integrable surfaces (surfaces for which z xy = z yx ).

Reference-contexts: One can use results of stereo or range data to improve results of SFS (such as [11] and [19]), or use results of SFS or range data to improve results of stereo. A different approach is to directly combine results from shading and stereo (such as <ref> [3] </ref>). Multiple images can also be employed by moving either the viewer (as in [6]) or the light source (as in [23]) in order to successively refine the shape.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the surface should be reconstructed from the interior of the image outward, instead of from the boundary inward. Based on this idea, Dupuis and Oliensis (D&O) <ref> [4, 16] </ref> formulated SFS as an optimal control problem, and solved it using numerical methods. The proof of equivalence between the optimal control representation and SFS was illustrated.

Surface slope estimates from the iterative scheme were expressed in terms of a linear combination of a finite set of orthogonal Fourier basis functions.

Reference-contexts: They combined the line drawing and shading constraints in an energy function, and recovered both surface normal and line labeling through the minimization of the energy function. The first global propagation approach was the characteristic strip technique by Horn <ref> [7] </ref>. A characteristic strip is a line in the image along which the surface depth and orientation can be computed if these quantities are known at the starting point of the line.

Reference-contexts: This projection was fulfilled by finding the closest set of coefficients which satisfy integrability in the linear combination. Their results showed improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Later, Horn <ref> [8] </ref> also replaced the smoothness constraint in his approach with an integrability constraint. The major problem with Horn's method is its slow convergence. Szeliski [20] sped it up using a hierarchical basis pre-conditioned conjugate gradient descent algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Global propagation approaches propagate the shape information from known surface points (e.g., singular points) to the whole image. Local approaches derive shape only from the intensity information of the surface points in a small neighborhood. One of the earlier global minimization approaches was by Ikeuchi and Horn <ref> [10] </ref>. Since each surface point has two unknowns for the surface normal, and each pixel in the image provides one gray value, therefore image gray levels alone are not enough to recover the shape. To overcome this, Ikeuchi and Horn introduced two constraints: The brightness constraint and the smoothness constraint.

Reference-contexts: Instead of the smoothness constraint, Zheng and Chellappa (Z&C) [24] introduced an intensity gradient constraint, which specifies that the intensity gradients of the reconstructed image and the input image are close to each other in both the x and y directions. Leclerc and Bobick (L&B) <ref> [11] </ref> solved directly for depth by using a discrete formulation and employing a conjugate gradient technique. The brightness constraint and smoothness constraint were applied to ensure convergence, and a stereo depth map was used as an initial estimate. <p> This trend will continue. SFS methods employing more sophisticated models will be developed to provide more accurate, and realistic, results. Another direction is the combination of shading with other cues. One can use results of stereo or range data to improve results of SFS (such as <ref> [11] </ref> and [19]), or use results of SFS or range data to improve results of stereo. A different approach is to directly combine results from shading and stereo (such as [3]).

Reference-contexts: Pentland [17] recovered shape information from the intensity, and its first and second derivatives. He used the assumption that the surface is locally spherical at each point. Under the same spherical assumption, L&R <ref> [12] </ref> computed the slant and tilt of the surface in the light source coordinate system through the first derivative of the intensity.

Reference-contexts: Leclerc and Bobick (L&B) [11] solved directly for depth by using a discrete formulation and employing a conjugate gradient technique. The brightness constraint and smoothness constraint were applied to ensure convergence, and a stereo depth map was used as an initial estimate. Recently, Lee and Kuo (L&K) <ref> [13] </ref> proposed an approach to recover depth using the brightness and the smoothness constraint. They approximated surfaces by a union of triangular patches. Unlike L&B's method, this approach did not require the depth from stereo as an initial value. All of the above approaches deal with a single smooth surface.

All of the above approaches deal with a single smooth surface. Malik and Maydan <ref> [14] </ref> developed the first solution for piecewise smooth surfaces.

Reference-contexts: The direction of characteristic strips are identified as the direction of intensity gradients. In order to get a dense shape map, new strips have to be interpolated when neighboring strips separate too much. Oliensis <ref> [15] </ref> observed that the smoothness con straint is only needed at the boundaries if we have initial values at the singular points. Therefore, the surface should be reconstructed from the interior of the image outward, instead of from the boundary inward.

However, this algorithm falls apart when the surface changes in a non-linear manner; this is clearly observed from the results of Sphere.
