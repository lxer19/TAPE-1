Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new methodology based on economic models to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to competing traffic classes (classes of sessions) in packet networks. We consider an economic model of a packet network where resources are priced. Traffic classes compete for network resources and they purchase them to satisfy their QoS needs. Our contributions are the following: 1) We provide a new definition for QoS provisioning based on economic models (Pareto efficiency). 2) We obtain the set of optimal resource allocations (Pareto optimal) which provide QoS guarantees to competing traffic classes. 3) We show the impact on equilibrium prices and optimal allocations due to traffic load and variability, and QoS requirements. 4) We propose packet scheduling and admission policies to provide QoS guarantees to traffic classes based on available QoS and prices in the network.

C = 60 packets (or units) per second, and B = 50 packets (or units). <p> An illustration is given in Figure 4 (b). Average Delay Constraint: The average delay for an M=M=1=B system is convex and decreasing in c 8 c 2 (; 1) and concave and increasing in b 8 b 2 (0; 1) <ref> [9] </ref>. Therefore, the preferences for average delay are non-convex. Due to this, if the utility is just average delay, then there does not exist price equilibrium or Pareto optimality.

Reference-contexts: An excellent survey of QoS provisioning techniques is given by Kurose [10]. He classified these techniques into four types, one such type is to provide bounds on QoS parameters such as cell (packet) loss in multiplexers per session in ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks <ref> [19, 21, 18, 20] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In section 4, we describe our future work and conclusions. 2 Model A wide variety of applications with various preferences are envisioned to use the high bandwidth networks of the future, thus a flexible service architecture is needed. For example, video applications have a wide variety of QoS requirements <ref> [22, 23] </ref>. The preferences of the applications (users) can be mapped to the resources they consume. In Figure 1 (a), an example is shown where the preferences of a user are convex in two resources (eg. buffer and link capacity).
