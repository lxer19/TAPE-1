Reference-contexts: word-final consonants; (2) simple (single) consonantal onsets and codas are favored over complex (multiple) onsets and codas; and (3) phonemes within the syllable are organized such that the most sonorous phoneme constitutes the nucleus of the syllable, and the least sonorous the exterior segments of the onset and/or the coda <ref> (Bell and Hooper, 1978) </ref>. How did these patterns emerge during the evolution of sound systems? A particularly compelling explanation is that they originate from constraints provided by the perceptual and articulatory systems of language users. Syllable types must be perceptually distinctive, and easy to articulate. <p> A similar observation holds for real languages: they are more likely to have initial consonant clusters than final clusters <ref> (Bell and Hooper, 1978) </ref>. The fact that most of the interior consonants in the clusters were sonorants in these simulations is also consistent with a similar preference in the world's languages.

Reference-contexts: Evidence from babbling, that is, infants' speech-like vocalizations dominated by speech-production constraints, suggests that mandibular oscillation provides a frame within which to organize consonants and vowels and that this frame appears to encourage a simpler syllable structure <ref> (Davis and MacNeilage, 1995) </ref>. Measurements of the relative jaw openness with which different consonants and vowels are produced strongly suggest that the consonantal sequencing constraint described by the sonority hierarchy could emerge from the close-open cycle (Lindblom, 1983; Keating, et al., 1994).

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, there also appears to be purely perceptual constraints against the occurrence of consonant clusters <ref> (Hura et al., 1992) </ref>. It has also been argued that the consonantal sequences that obey the 14 sonority principle are more perceptible than those that do not, and therefore occur more frequently because language users select for maximally perceptually distinctive combinations of sounds (Kawasaki, 1982; Ohala, 1990).

Reference-contexts: The ESS model suggests that this asymmetry may be simply due to the fact that most of the world's languages have inventories with greater numbers of consonants than vowels <ref> (Maddieson, 1984) </ref>. Like final consonants, consonant clusters are also disfavored in the world's languages, as they are in the model. Consonant clusters were more prevalent in the 3rd partial model, which had a constraint against the co-occurrence of consonants and vowels.

Reference-contexts: Thus our model, which will be referred to as the Emergent Syllable Systems model, or ESS, simulates the emergence of a vocabulary of words. 2.1 Vocabulary Evolution The ESS model is based on Symbiotic Evolution <ref> (Moriarty and Miikkulainen, 1996) </ref>. In this method, genetic algorithms evolve a population of partial solutions that combine to yield an optimal solution to the given problem.

Reference-contexts: Shanit Perry, Shanit Kerry). In addition to a purely perceptual constraint against consonant clusters, clusters are also probably produced with less distinctive acoustic cues. Segments that participate in complex syllables are shorter in duration than segments that occur in simple CV syllables <ref> (Sigurd, 1973) </ref>. Moon and Lindblom (1994) showed that the relevant articulators are less likely to reach the segmental target in shorter segments.
