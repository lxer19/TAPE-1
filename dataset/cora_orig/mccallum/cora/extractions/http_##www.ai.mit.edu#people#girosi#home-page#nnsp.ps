Abstract: We consider the problem of how to incorporate prior knowledge in supervised learning techniques. We set the problem in the framework of regularization theory, and consider the case in which we know that the approximated function has radial symmetry. The problem can be solved in two alternative ways: 1) use the invariance as a constraint in the regularization theory framework to derive a rotation invariant version of Radial Basis Functions; 2) use the radial symmetry to create new, "virtual" examples from a given data set. We show that these two apparently different methods of learning from

Reference-contexts: We used the standard Gaussian RBF technique, and the corresponding technique (see eq. 7 and 9) that makes use of the prior knowledge. An increasing number of examples, from 16 to 225, has been generated by sampling the function h on a grid in the square <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 . The generalization error of the two techniques, computed on a test set of 400 data points also on a regular grid, has been plotted, in a logarithmic scale, as a function of the number of examples (figure 2a).
