Abstract: Advanced diagnostic techniques have become essential for supporting reliable testing of modern systems due to the rapid growth in complexity of these systems. Errors in the test process become more likely with increased complexity and need to be treated carefully to maximize accuracy in diagnosis. In this paper, we discuss several approaches to analyzing conflicting test results. We have concentrated on one approach based on model-based diagnosisthe information flow modelto identify conflict and improve diagnostics.

Reference-contexts: We determine how much the new evidence conflicts with previously accumulated evidence (initially assuming no disagreement). Then we revise the support for each conclusion using a variant on Dempsters Rule of Combinations <ref> ( Dempster, 1968) </ref> which computes normalized mutual support and denial for each conclusion Managing Conflict in System Diagnosis 119 using the current accumulation of support and denial with the support and denial received from the most recently evaluated test (Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, if testing yields inconsistent results, one possible high probability cause is the presence of multiple faults. Typically, multiple faults are identified and addressed in single fault systems using a sequential approach to diagnosis and repair <ref> ( Shakeri et al. , 1995) </ref>. In particular, first a single fault is identified and repaired. After the fault is removed from the system, the system undergoes additional testing to determine if another fault exists in the system. If so, it is identified and repaired as before.

Reference-contexts: Support and denial for conflict then consist of combining support and denial at each step in the sequence using the combination procedures described by Equations 14 and 15. All we need now is a way to determine s u u <ref> (Sheppard, 1996) </ref>. Consider two tests t i j . These two tests may conflict in any of four possible situationswhen both tests pass, when both tests fail, when t i passes and t fails, and when t i fails and t j passes.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the same models used to evaluate testability of the system can be used for troubleshooting. 3. THE INFORMATION FLOW MODEL To address s everal problems associated with performing system diagnosis and analyzing system testability, we introduced the concept of an information flow model <ref> (Simpson & Sheppard, 1994) </ref>. This model-based approach to system test and diagnosis incorporates techniques from information fusion and model-based reasoning to guide analysis. The model represents the problem to be solved as diagnostic information flow. <p> The sequence ends when adequate information is derived for fault isolation.

DIAGNOSIS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT WITH DEMPSTER-SHAFER INFERENCE Our approach to diagnosis uses a modification of Dempster-Shafer (Dempster, 1968; Shafer, 1976) statistical inference in its inference engine (Simpson & Sheppard, 1994). <p> local search), it is based upon a higher order representation and has been providing performance near the theoretical optimum <ref> (Simpson & Sheppard, 1994) </ref>. 5.

This special conclusion helps to compensate for declining uncertainty in the face of conflict. The support for an unanticipated result (representing conflict) is computed whenever evidence denies the current hypothesis.

Reference-contexts: Certainty factors were first used by Edward Shortliffe in his MYCIN system, developed in the early 1970s and provided an intuitive approach to reasoning under uncertainty in rule-based systems that had several roots in probability theory <ref> ( Shortliffe, 1976) </ref>. As we started to work with certainty factors, we found they satisfied all of our requirements except for the handling of conflict. The following describes our implementation of certainty factors for the information flow model, including the creation of a conflict-management strategy that satisfies the above requirements.
