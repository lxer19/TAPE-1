Abstract: The ability of a statistical/neural network to classify faces by sex by means of a pixel-based representation has not been fully investigated. Simulations using pixel-based codes have reported sex classification results that are less impressive than those reported for measurement-based codes. In no case, however, have the reported pixel-based simulations been optimized for the task of classifying faces by sex. A serie of simulations is described in which four network models were applied to the same pixel-based face code. These simulations involved either a radial basis function network or a perceptron as a classifier, preceded or not by a preprocessing step of eigendecomposition. It is shown that performance comparable to that of the measurement-based models can be achieved with pixel-based input (90%) when the data are preprocessed. The effect of the eigendecomposition preprocessing of the faces is then compared with spatial frequency analysis of face images and analyzed in terms of the perceptual information it captures. It is shown that such an examination may offer insight into the facial aspects important to the sex classification process. Finally, the contribution of hair information to the performance of the model is evaluated. It is shown that, although the hair contributes to the sex classification process it is not the only important contributor.
