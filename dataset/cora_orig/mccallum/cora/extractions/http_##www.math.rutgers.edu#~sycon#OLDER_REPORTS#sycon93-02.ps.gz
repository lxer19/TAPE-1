Abstract: Recall that the pair of matrices (A; C) is said to be observable -in the sense of classical linear systems theory; see e.g. [5], Section 5.2- if the largest A-invariant subspace included in ker C, denoted O(A; C), is zero. Regarding the testability of the conditions in the Theorem, observe that one way to compute O c = O c (A; C) is by the following recursive procedure, where we use the notation i for the projection onto the ith coordi nate axis: O 0 belong to the class S. However, as soon as a particular system is not in S, the previous conditions are not longer sufficient. We next provide an example which illustrates the fact that the assumption that the function satisfies Property IP, is essential to conclude Theorem These systems satisfy all our observability conditions -except for the fact that does not have property IP- but they are not observable. Indeed, we consider the pair (A; C) implies that the system of interest is observable. But the converse is not true. For an example, consider any system in which each column of C is nonzero but A is a nonsingular diagonal matrix, such as A = I. In this case, the pair (A; C) is not observable (if n &gt; 1 and ker C 6= 0), but, from Corollary 2.3, we have that, if B 2 B, the system is observable. [1] Albertini, F., and E.D.
