Abstract: We describe two domain-independent temporal reasoning systems called TimeGraph I and II which can be used in AI-applications as tools for efficiently managing large sets of relations in the Point Algebra, in the Interval Algebra, and metric information such as absolute times and durations. Our representation of time is based on timegraphs, graphs partitioned into a set of chains on which the search is supported by a metagraph data structure. TimeGraph I was originally developed by Taugher, Schubert and Miller in the context of story comprehension. TimeGraph II provides useful extensions, including efficient algorithms for handing inequations, and relations expressing point-interval exclusion and interval disjointness. These extensions make the system much more expressive in the representation of qualitative information and suitable for a large class of applications.

Reference-contexts: Analogously for paths from v 2 to v 1 . An algorithm for accomplishing this task can be derived by an adaptation of the single-source-longest-paths algorithm reported in <ref> [5] </ref>. This algorithm has a time complexity of O (h + ^e + ^n), where h is the constant corresponding to the time required by the four special cases. Querying metric information may require an O (e) time search process. <p> Once we have an instantiation of D, we can easily solve the problem of finding a consistent scenario by adding the instantiation to T and using a topological sort algorithm <ref> [32, 5] </ref>. Also the task of checking whether a relation R between two time points x and y is entailed by a D-timegraph hT ; Di can be reduced to the problem of finding an instantiation of D in an augmented version of T .

Using this method we have incorporated into TG-II a specialized algorithm for deciding a set of binary disjunction of inequalities (i.e., relations of the form (pt1 &lt; pt2) _ (pt3 &lt; pt4)) (see [12] 4 For example, the "T-derivability" rule <p> selective backtracking (for more details see <ref> [12] </ref>), and uses a "forward propagation" technique to greatly enhance efficiency.

The curves in Figure 7 report the results of an experiment aimed at testing the scalability of TG-II for the task of deciding randomly generated consistent set of disjunctions (see <ref> [12] </ref> for more details). The two curves of the first graph show the average cpu-time (seconds) required for deciding sets of disjunctions of size n (for n the number of time points) with 8n and 2nlogn simple PA-relations (with the logarithm truncated to its integer part).
