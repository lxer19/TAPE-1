Abstract: Common Lisp's Metaobject Protocol defines classes of objects which embody various aspects of the object oriented programming environment. Current such metaobjects represent classes, slots, generic functions, methods, as well as other object oriented entities. Not currently included, however, are objects that represent generic function and method parameters. This paper first gives class definitions declaring the behavior of these proposed parameter metaobjects and then proceeds to argue for for their inclusion in the expected addition of the Metaobjects Protocol to the ANSI Common Lisp Standard.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Common Lisp Object System's (CLOS) Metaobject Protocol (MOP), as put forth in The Art of the Metaobject Protocol (AMOP) <ref> [2] </ref>, provides metaobjects representing many aspects of the state of the dynamic object oriented program. 1 It is widely embraced as a de facto standard. 2 Perhaps the largest aspect of the object oriented program still untamed by the MOP is the rendering of the actual method code as a network <p> This is true provided that the GF is specialized on at least one metaobject. It is accomplished by the subclassing of metaobjects and the advising of advertised GF's with methods specialized on the new metaclass subclasses.

Reference-contexts: Then, with this foundation, it sets forth parameter metaobjects as one means of directly enhancing the power of this environment. 3.2.2 Basic Metadata Manipulation Multiple options presently exist for maintaining objects with slot-instance-specific metadata such as the unit of measure of the slot's contents <ref> [3] </ref> [4]. An object's slot can be queried for this metadata and in the case of unit of measure data, a program could use this metadata to convert the slot's contents to another unit of measure.
