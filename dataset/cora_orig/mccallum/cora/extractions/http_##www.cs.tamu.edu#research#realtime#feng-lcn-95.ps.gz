Abstract: We address the issue of guaranteeing application-to-application deadlines of messages in distributed real-time systems. Most of the previous studies have focused on either host subsystem or network subsystem. Our study considers the entire integrated system. We develop two methods to test whether the message deadlines are met. The first method, called the independent method, obtains conservative estimates of message delays by independently analyzing each subsystem. This method is easy to use and efficient, but may sometimes give pessimistic results. The second method, called the integrated method, computes the delays more accurately by modeling interactions among the subsystems in greater detail. Performance of the two methods is evaluated in terms of the p robability of guaranteeing message sets for given host utilization.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the timing behavior of the host subsystem also depends on the scheduling discipline used by the host operating system. Research has primarily focused on scheduling of a single host [9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20] or on the analysis of the network subsystem <ref> [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 13, 18, 21, 22] </ref>. Recall that the network subsystem usually covers only the data link layer and the physical layer. In many high-speed networks, the contribution of higher layer protocol processing to message delay is significant.

Reference-contexts: A network like Ethernet does not meet this requirement. However, many other networks such as IEEE 802.5 and FDDI token ring networks can provide such a guarantee and hence are suitable for use in real-time applications <ref> [12] </ref>. We will use d Nm i Np i to denote the maximum network delay experienced by a message and a packet (of stream M i ), respectively. At host subsystems, we assume a simple transport layer protocol like UDP (rather than TCP) over IP.
