Abstract: We have described a method to simulate heat transfer in real time that also allows for the generation of realistic infrared images and for infrared signature analysis of objects. The dynamic nature of this model allows a user, through the use of a head mounted display, graphics hardware, and our three dimensional software libraries, to interact with this infrared environment in real time. The user is not confined to only one view point or temperature, but instead may walk around the environment and watch the objects settle towards their equilibrium temperatures. Through the use of voice activated menus the user is also free to dynamically change certain characteristics of the environment. This allows the user to turn on or off lights and other heat sources, and then observe the effect that this has on the environment. Also, since the atmosphere provides a complete thermal enclosure for an environment, extensions to outdoor scene modeling are not difficult. For those undergoing training in infrared vision equipment, such simulators should prove extremely valuable.
