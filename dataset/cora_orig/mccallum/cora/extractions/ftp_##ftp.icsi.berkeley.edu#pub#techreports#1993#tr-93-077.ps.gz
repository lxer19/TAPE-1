Abstract: This paper describes a new, psychologically-plausible model of human sentence interpretation, based on a new model of linguistic structure, Construction Grammar. This on-line, parallel, probabilistic interpreter accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results on lexical access, idiom processing, parsing preferences, and studies of gap-filling and other valence ambiguities, including various frequency effects. We show that many of these results derive from the fundamental assumptions of Construction Grammar that lexical idioms, idioms, and syntactic structures are uniformly represented as grammatical constructions, and argue for the use of probabilistically-enriched grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.

Reference-contexts: We also summarize our preliminary work on probabilistic motivations for the local coherence model. The problem with the global models, in particular with models based on the Principle of A Priori Plausibility <ref> (Crain & Steedman 1985) </ref>, is that they are unable to account for the well-known garden-path sentences, in which people choose implausible interpretations in order to fill local expectations, or in which local preferences cause correct interpretations to be discarded in favor of incorrect ones.

Reference-contexts: Frequently a representational choice is simplified by this ability to use semantic knowledge, thus capturing complex constraints on a construction's constituents, in a sort of semantic analogue to the complex syntactic constraints expressible in a theory like TAG <ref> (Joshi 1985) </ref>. But Lakoff (1987), Fillmore et al. (1988), and Kay (1990) have argued that allowing semantic and pragmatic constraints on constructions is more than just a representational simplification. They present constructions which cannot be correctly described without semantic and pragmatic contraints.

Reference-contexts: Given a choice between two expectations, if one is more specific to the constituent just integrated, it is preferred by StrongExp. This idea of choosing a more specific rule when two rules, is often referred to as Panini's Principle, or the elsewhere condition <ref> (Kiparsky 1973) </ref>. Its use in sentence processing was first proposed by Wilensky & Arens (1980) and Wilensky (1983) for choosing among interpretations, and by Hobbs & Bear (1990) for choosing among attachments.

Reference-contexts: The current implementation of SAL does not have a robust evidence-combination algorithm. Currently we simply sum the probabilities from various evidence sources. Since combining top-down and bottom-up evidence is the subject of a large Bayes Net literature <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref>, we expect to use such algorithms in future work. However, psycholinguistic results on the relation between top-down and bottom-up evidence are quite controversial.

Reference-contexts: These slots act as the valence of a construction, in effect creating expectations for slot fillers. 6 A lexical theory like HPSG <ref> (Pollard & Sag 1987) </ref> might choose to represent how as a degree word, and then argue that all lexical items with scalar semantics select specifiers which are degree words.

Reference-contexts: common constructions should be suggested more easily and quickly than less frequent ones, as we can see from a number of experimental results: high-frequency lexical items have higher initial activation than low-frequency ones (Marslen-Wilson (1990)), are accessed more easily (Tyler 1984 and Zwitserlood 1989), and reach recognition threshold more quickly <ref> (Simpson & Burgess 1985 and Salasoo & Pisoni 1985) </ref>. Similarly, experiments on idioms have shown that more familiar idioms are accessed more quickly (Flores d'Arcais 1993). This suggests that evidence for a construction c should be weighted in direct proportion to its frequency.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, serial models of lexical and idiom access have fallen somewhat out of favor, due to extensive results which argue for parallelism (Swinney 1979; Swinney & Cutler 1979). Thus most researchers on idiom processing assume some form of the lexicalization hypothesis <ref> (Swinney & Cutler 1979) </ref>, which proposes that idioms are stored as long lexical items and accessed in parallel with normal lexical items. While psycholinguistic results on syntactic access are somewhat more contentious, a number of recent results argue for parallelism in syntactic processing, as we have discussed above. <p> For example, we cited in the introduction a large number of studies showing that language processing is strictly on-line, ruling out a bottom-up model which delays until every constituent has been seen. Similarly, a number of studies have shown results inconsistent with contextual selection and other purely top-down models <ref> (Swinney 1979) </ref>. The left-corner model combines advantages of the bottom-up and top-down models; a rule is accessed by only the first constituent, and then processing continues in a top-down manner from the rest of the rule. Such models have been proposed for both syntactic parsing and lexical access.

Reference-contexts: This on-line disambiguation distinguishes the algorithm from parsers which maintain every possible parse, such as the active chart parser of Kaplan (1973), the breadth-first ATN parser <ref> (Woods 1970) </ref>, or the LR-style parser of Tomita (1987). SAL is evidential because it allows syntactic, semantic, and higher-level expectations to help access linguistic information, integrate constructions into the interpretation, and choose among candidate interpretations. Its access and disambiguation weigh evidence probabilistically.
