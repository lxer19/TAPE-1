Abstract: This paper explores a new approach to performing resource allocation in autonomous distributed computer systems. As opposed to most previous work which is based on inter-processor cooperation, we model the distributed system as a competitive society of microeconomic agents. We apply this model to the problem of managing distributed, replicated data objects. In our economy, jobs and transactions submitting Read/Write operations on data objects pay the processors to perform the operations. The processors use the revenue they earn to lease copies of data objects on which they can make a profit. The data objects themselves are active agents and set the prices for leasing copies. We evaluate our economy through a simulation study. Our experiments show that the economy can substantially improve performance relative to global static policies by adapting the number of copies of each object based on the ratio of Read to Write access, and by detecting and exploiting localities in reference patterns. The economy solves a version of the File Allocation Problem and we compare it to previous work in this area.

Reference-contexts: The data management problem is to minimize mean transaction response time. The parameters that can be controlled are: 1) The number of copies of each data object. 2) The assignment of copies to processing nodes. Our model does not explicitly study the effects of concurrency control <ref> [1] </ref>. The data management economy is compatible with concurrency control protocols that do not block transactions, e.g. - Timestamp, Optimistic [1]. However, the performance results in this paper would clearly be effected by including concur-rency control. <p> Our model does not explicitly study the effects of concurrency control <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The problem definition treats the data objects as abstract resources. In a real system, they could correspond to Relations <ref> [2] </ref>, tuples, files, records or any other data structure. There may be multiple copies of each data object at distinct processor nodes. User processes, jobs and transactions enter the system at all processors. For simplicity, we will simply refer to the units of work as transactions.

Reference-contexts: Copies of objects are assigned to the processors at which they are most frequently referenced. We provided several examples that illustrate how the economy uses supply and demand to achieve the performance improvements. The data management economy solves a version of the File Allocation Problem <ref> [3, 9] </ref>. We presented a survey of previous work on this problem, and compared it with our economy. The main advantages of the data management economy relative to previous work are: 1) Decentralized decision making, 2) Realistic system models, 3) Computational tractability.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this paper is to explore a new approach to designing resource allocation algorithms for autonomous distributed computer systems. This approach uses concepts drawn from Microeconomics <ref> [6] </ref>. and is motivated by the apparent similarities between large computer systems and human economies. Like an economy, a computer system has a scarce set of resources (processors, memory, data, etc.) that must be allocated to a diverse set of consumers.

Reference-contexts: No attempt is made to globally improve or optimize the performance of the system as a whole. The goal is for each agent to adequately define its goals and utilities, and the rules for maximizing them in a way that accomplishes global performance improvement through an Invisible Hand <ref> [8] </ref>. In this paper, we demonstrate several benefits to this microeconomic approach to resource allocation by designing and evaluating an economy that manages distributed replicated data objects.
