Reference-contexts: Finally, Skiena showed that if all convex polygons in a class have n vertices, then only 3dn=2e probes are needed for testing. - 8 - i v i v v j (a) Star-shaped polygons (b) Sets of k disjoint convex polygons Alevizos, Boissonnat and Yvinec <ref> [ABY89] </ref> considered the problem of identifying a simple polygon using a stronger type of finger probe that is allowed to be a polygonal path instead of a straight ray and that returns not only a contact point but also the normal to the edge on which the contact point is located.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, when a diameter measurement is made (i.e. when the part is gripped) it is assumed that the part moves until it is in a stable grasp. There are at most n stable grasps on an n-sided convex polygon [RG94]. - 11 - Arkin, Held, Mitchell and Skiena <ref> [AHMS94] </ref> showed that it is NP-Complete to find an optimal decision tree to identify one of a library of distinguishable convex polygonal models using diameter probes.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that the number of probes needed to distinguish among a library of m models is at least dlog me and no more than m 1 [JE94b]. - 7 - For static testing, both Belleville and Shermer <ref> [BS93] </ref> and Jia and Erdmann [JE94b] showed that it is NP-Complete to find a minimum cardinality set of point probes that can be used to distinguish among a library of m polygonal models, even if all the polygons are convex. <p> Using this model a simple n-vertex polygon can be verified with n finger probes, one hitting each vertex. 4.2 Model-based testing with finger probes Belleville and Shermer <ref> [BS93] </ref> showed that it is NP-Complete to find a minimum cardinality set of finger probes that can be used in static testing to distinguish among a library of m convex unimodal polygons in standard position.

Reference-contexts: Geometric probing is the area of computational geometry that examines how to identify, verify, or determine some property of an unknown geometric object using a measuring device known as a probe. The area of geometric probing was introduced into the computational geometry field by Cole and Yap <ref> [CY87] </ref>, although probing algorithms had been studied previously in the application areas of robotics [OT77, GLP84a, GLP84b, ERH86, Gri86, Pug86b, Sch86], computer vision [CD86, Hor86, Pug86a] and tomography [Ham63, HR73, Her80, Her83, Vol86]. <p> The finger probes used by most strategies originate from infinity and hit the object from the outside. 4.1 Shape-based testing with finger probes Cole and Yap <ref> [CY87] </ref> showed that 2n finger probes are both necessary and sufficient to test a convex polygon where the target polygon has n vertices. The probes must contact each vertex and the interior of each edge once (see Figure 5). <p> one of m n-sided star-shaped polygonal models when the orientation of the model being probed is unknown. 5 Line Probes There is a duality between finger probes and line probes (or hyperplane probes in higher dimensions) [Gre85, DEY86, Ski88], so the 2n result for testing convex polygons with finger probes <ref> [CY87] </ref> also applies to line probes. Several people have looked at the problem of approximating non-polygonal convex objects using line probes. Lindenbaum and Bruckstein [LB94] considered approximating planar convex sets where the error measure * is the Hausdorff metric between the probed object and the approximating polygon.

Natarajan <ref> [Nat87] </ref> looked at the problem of how to determine the orientation of an n vertex object with n possible orientations using a weaker form of finger probe that only detects whether or not it intersects the object. <p> Their algorithms also work for nonconvex models if the convex hulls of the models are distinguishable with diameter probes. 7 X-Ray Probes No work has been done on model-based testing with x-ray probes although the techniques used by Natarajan <ref> [Nat87] </ref> and Skiena [Ski88] to determine the orientation of an object using a weaker form of finger probe that only detects whether it intersects the object can also be used with x-ray probes since they are a stronger form of these probes.

Reference-contexts: This is a function d : [0; 2) ! R that returns, for any angle, the diameter of the object at that angle. However, for every non-trivial valid diameter function d there exist infinitely many convex polygons having diameter function d <ref> [RG94] </ref> (see Figure 8). This implies that shape-based testing is not possible for convex polygons using diameter probes. Therefore, model-based testing strategies have been studied. <p> Each internal node of the decision tree for the testing strategy gives an angle for the next diameter probe. A particular orientation for each part is not assumed, but the only diameter measurements allowed are those in which the part is in a stable grasp by the gripper (see <ref> [RG94] </ref> for a definition of a stable grasp by a parallel-jaw gripper). Therefore, when a diameter measurement is made (i.e. when the part is gripped) it is assumed that the part moves until it is in a stable grasp. <p> Therefore, when a diameter measurement is made (i.e. when the part is gripped) it is assumed that the part moves until it is in a stable grasp.

Reference-contexts: The upper bound for reconstruction was improved to 3 q * + 2) probes by Richardson <ref> [Ric95] </ref>. A variation on line probes uses a half-line that pivots around a given input point until it hits the object. Two of these half-line probes pivoting in opposite directions can be combined to make a cone probe that touches the object on either side (see Figure 7).

Reference-contexts: If the positive probes had instead been chosen on the boundaries of the target objects, then the strategies would not be two-sided. Romanik <ref> [Rom92] </ref> studied general properties that make a class of geometric objects testable or untestable. Characterizing properties that make a class of objects testable is difficult since adding a finite set of points to each object in a class can make it either testable or untestable.

Reference-contexts: If the probes produced by an approximate testing strategy accept a tested object, then its error with respect to the target is no greater than the given error bound. If a class of geometric objects has an approximate testing strategy, then the class is testable. Romanik and Smith <ref> [RS94] </ref> showed that d + 2 point probes are necessary and sufficient to test a ball in E d . <p> chosen near the ends of one diameter of the target ball, and d evenly spaced negative probes are chosen on the (d 1)-dimensional plane that orthogonally bisects this diameter (see Figure 1 (a)).

Reference-contexts: Two positive probes are chosen near opposite corners of the rectangle, and 2d negative probes are chosen by reflecting each positive probe outside the rectangle in each dimension (see Romanik and Salzberg <ref> [RS95] </ref> showed that the testing strategy using 2d + 2 point probes for one rectangle can be extended to k rectangles in E 2 yielding a strategy that uses 6k point probes, which are also necessary. <p> In this strategy each of the two positive point probes for a rectangle is reflected outside the target object in both directions for each dimension (see Figure 2 (a)). Romanik and Salzberg <ref> [RS95] </ref> also gave a testing strategy using 3n point probes for rectilinear shapes with or without holes in E 2 with n corners (see Figure 2 (b)) and a testing strategy using 8n point probes for rectilinear shapes with or without holes in E 3 with n corners.

Reference-contexts: For a survey of the entire area of geometric probing, the reader may consult <ref> [Ski88, Ski89, Lin90, Ski92] </ref>. Geometric testing is the subarea of geometric probing that studies the verification task. <p> The probes must contact each vertex and the interior of each edge once (see Figure 5). This result can be generalized to n + f for convex polytopes in E d , where f is the number of (d 1)-dimensional faces of the target. Skiena <ref> [Ski88] </ref> extended Cole and Yap's result to two disjoint convex polygons, but showed that for m &gt; 2 there exist collections of m disjoint convex polygons that cannot be verified with finger probes. <p> He showed that in two dimensions n=2 batch probes are necessary and n are sufficient to determine the orientation, and in three dimensions n=4 probes are necessary and 6n are sufficient.

Several people have looked at the problem of approximating non-polygonal convex objects using line probes. <p> Their algorithms also work for nonconvex models if the convex hulls of the models are distinguishable with diameter probes. 7 X-Ray Probes No work has been done on model-based testing with x-ray probes although the techniques used by Natarajan [Nat87] and Skiena <ref> [Ski88] </ref> to determine the orientation of an object using a weaker form of finger probe that only detects whether it intersects the object can also be used with x-ray probes since they are a stronger form of these probes.
