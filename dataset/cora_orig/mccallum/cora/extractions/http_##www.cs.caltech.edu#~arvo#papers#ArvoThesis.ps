Title: ANALYTIC METHODS FOR SIMULATED LIGHT TRANSPORT  
Author: James Richard Arvo 
Date: 1995  
Affiliation: Yale University  
Abstract: This thesis presents new mathematical and computational tools for the simulation of light transport in realistic image synthesis. New algorithms are presented for exact computation of direct illumination effects related to light emission, shadowing, and first-order scattering from surfaces. New theoretical results are presented for the analysis of global illumination algorithms, which account for all interreflec-tions of light among surfaces of an environment. First, a closed-form expression is derived for the irradiance Jacobian, which is the derivative of a vector field representing radiant energy flux. The expression holds for diffuse polygonal scenes and correctly accounts for shadowing, or partial occlusion. Three applications of the irradiance Jacobian are demonstrated: locating local irradiance extrema, direct computation of isolux contours, and surface mesh generation. Next, the concept of irradiance is generalized to tensors of arbitrary order. A recurrence relation for irradiance tensors is derived that extends a widely used formula published by Lambert in 1760. Several formulas with applications in computer graphics are derived from this recurrence relation and are independently verified using a new Monte Carlo method for sampling spherical triangles. The formulas extend the range of non-diffuse effects that can be computed in closed form to include illumination from directional area light sources and reflections from and transmissions through glossy surfaces.

Here f will typically denote either a surface or field radiance function, which is zero over one hemisphere. Definition (6.11) is also meaningful for p &lt; 1, but the corresponding norms are not strictly convex and are normally excluded [83].

Reference-contexts: This simple coupling is a consequence of steady-state radiance being invariant along rays in free space; in the presence of participating media the coupling is replaced by the equation of transfer along the ray [26], which turns equation (6.1) into an integro-differential equation <ref> [6] </ref>. Equation (6.1), which first appeared in this general form in thermal engineering, is a continuous balance equation governing the direct exchange of monochromatic radiant energy among surfaces with arbitrary reflectance characteristics. In current radiative heat transfer literature, this governing equation is used only when participating media are ignored [110,99].

Reference-contexts: Given these restrictions, we derive error bounds in terms of potentially known quantities, such as bounds on emission and reflectivity, and bounds on measurement error. To bound the error of a numerical solution using this type of information we draw upon the general theory of integral equations <ref> [11] </ref> as well as the more abstract theory of operator equations [4,81]. 7.1 Pro jection Methods By far the most common methods for solving global illumination problems are those employing surface discretizations, which are essentially boundary element methods [95]. <p> The dependence on the type of projection appears in the factor of 1 + jj P n jj and in the constant ffi P . For all projections based on inner products, jj P n jj = 1 when the basis functions are orthogonal <ref> [11, p. 64] </ref>. For other methods, such as collocation, the norm of the projection may be greater than one [11, p. 56]. The meaning of the constant ffi P is more subtle. <p> For all projections based on inner products, jj P n jj = 1 when the basis functions are orthogonal [11, p. 64].

Reference-contexts: This application of the adjoint transport operator has been used in simulating diffuse environments by Smits et al. [151] and in non-diffuse environments by Aupperle et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. The approach is known as importance-driven global illumination. The problem of computing view-dependent solutions for global illumination is similar to the "flux at a point" problems that arise in reactor shielding calculations, where it is necessary to compute the flux of neutrons arriving at a small detector [29]. <p> Sillion et al. [149] used a truncated series of spherical harmonics to capture directional dependence and a quadrilateral mesh of surface elements for the spatial dependence. As a third contrasting approach, Aupperle et al. <ref> [12] </ref> used piecewise-constant functions defined over pairs of patches to account for both directional and spatial variations. The accuracy of the approximation is limited by the space of basis functions; in general, the exact solution cannot be formed by a finite linear combination of polynomials or other basis functions.

Reference-contexts: The approach is known as importance-driven global illumination. The problem of computing view-dependent solutions for global illumination is similar to the "flux at a point" problems that arise in reactor shielding calculations, where it is necessary to compute the flux of neutrons arriving at a small detector <ref> [29] </ref>. Such problems are solved much more efficiently using the adjoint transport equation [87,153]. For global illumination, the direct and adjoint solutions can be used in conjunction by computing them simultaneously. This approach allows view-dependent solutions to be computed far more efficiently than either component in isolation [151].

Reference-contexts: We now look at examples of each of these. Perturbation of the Linear System The most computationally expensive operation of global illumination is the evaluation of the matrix elements in equation (7.6); this is true even of algorithms that do not store an explicit matrix <ref> [30] </ref>. Furthermore, only in very special cases can the matrix elements be formed exactly, as they entail visibility calculations coupled with multiple integration. Consequently, the computed matrix is nearly always perturbed by computational errors. A common example of an error in this category is imprecise form factors. <p> In approaches where the matrix is constructed in advance, such as "full matrix" radiosity [31] or hierarchical radiosity [62], the iterative solution can be carried out to essentially full convergence. Other approaches, such as progressive radiosity <ref> [30] </ref>, construct matrix elements on the fly and then discard them. The cost of computing these elements generally precludes complete convergence, making this source of error significant. 7.3 Error Bounds With the results of the previous section we can obtain bounds for each category of error.

For completeness, a proof which parallels that given by Kato is included below. To simplify notation the theorem is proved using functions of a single real variable.

Reference-contexts: An alternative is to represent the influence of distant surfaces using an explicit linear operator. The latter approach has several advantages, as demonstrated below. To precisely define the function r 0 appearing in equation (6.1), we introduce two intermediate functions similar to those employed by Glassner <ref> [47] </ref>. First, the boundary distance function -(r; u) is defined by -(r; u) inf fx &gt; 0 : r + xu 2 Mg ; which is the distance from r to the nearest point on the surface M in the direction 137 of u.

Reference-contexts: Basis Functions For many global illumination algorithms, the basis functions are completely determined by the geometry of the boundary elements. This is true of any piecewise-constant approximation, such as those employed by Goral et al. <ref> [52] </ref>, Cohen et al.[31], and Hanrahan et al. [62]. Often a smoothing step is applied to piecewise-constant approximations for display purposes, although this does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the approximation. <p> The ijth element of the resulting linear system has the form h u i j u j i h u i j KGu j i : (7.10) The Galerkin method was first employed in global illumination by Goral et al. <ref> [52] </ref> using a uniform mesh and constant basis functions. The use of higher-order basis functions was investigated by Heckbert [64] and later by Zatz [184] and Troutman and Max [164]. For diffuse environments with constant elements, the second inner product in equation (7.10) reduces to an area-to-area form factor. <p> Inexact Solution of the Linear System Once the discrete linear system is formed, we must solve for the coefficients ff 1 ; : : : ; ff n . This has been done in a number of ways, including Gaussian elimination <ref> [52] </ref>, Gauss-Seidel [31], Southwell relaxation [30,49], which is also known as shooting, and Jacobi iteration [62].

Reference-contexts: For global illumination the space X n may consist of n boundary elements over which the radiance function is constant. Alternatively, it may consist of fewer boundary elements, but with internal degrees of freedom, such as tensor product polynomials [184], spherical harmonics [149], or wavelets <ref> [53] </ref>. In any case, each element of the function space X n is a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions, u 1 ; : : : ; u n . <p> Often a smoothing step is applied to piecewise-constant approximations for display purposes, although this does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the approximation. When non-constant elements are employed, such as tensor product polynomials [184,164] or wavelets <ref> [53] </ref>, the degrees of freedom of the elements add to the dimension of the approximating subspace. For non-diffuse environments the finite-dimensional space must also account for the directional dependence of surface radiance functions; several avenues have been explored for doing this. <p> Another form of matrix perturbation arises from simplifications made for the sake of efficiency.

Reference-contexts: Basis Functions For many global illumination algorithms, the basis functions are completely determined by the geometry of the boundary elements. This is true of any piecewise-constant approximation, such as those employed by Goral et al. [52], Cohen et al.[31], and Hanrahan et al. <ref> [62] </ref>. Often a smoothing step is applied to piecewise-constant approximations for display purposes, although this does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the approximation. <p> Errors are also introduced when form factors are approximated through ray tracing [171] or by using simpler geometries <ref> [62] </ref>. These errors can be mitigated to some extent by the use of analytic form factors [18,140], yet there remain many cases for which no analytic expression is known, particularly in the presence of occluders. <p> Another form of matrix perturbation arises from simplifications made for the sake of efficiency. For example, small entries may be set to zero [94], or the entire matrix may be approximated by one with a more efficient structure, such as a block matrix <ref> [62] </ref> or a wavelet decomposition [53]. Inexact Solution of the Linear System Once the discrete linear system is formed, we must solve for the coefficients ff 1 ; : : : ; ff n . <p> This has been done in a number of ways, including Gaussian elimination [52], Gauss-Seidel [31], Southwell relaxation [30,49], which is also known as shooting, and Jacobi iteration <ref> [62] </ref>. In any such method, there will be some error introduced in the solution process: direct solvers like Gaussian elimination are prone to roundoff error, whereas iterative solvers like Gauss-Seidel must halt after a finite number of iterations. <p> In approaches where the matrix is constructed in advance, such as "full matrix" radiosity [31] or hierarchical radiosity <ref> [62] </ref>, the iterative solution can be carried out to essentially full convergence. Other approaches, such as progressive radiosity [30], construct matrix elements on the fly and then discard them. <p> We denote the perturbed system and its solution by f A e ff = e b: (7.27) Although the exact matrix is unknown, it is frequently possible to bound the error present in each element. For instance, this can be done for approximate form factors and block matrix approximations <ref> [62] </ref>. Given element-by-element error bounds, the impact on the final solution can be bounded.

Reference-contexts: For non-diffuse environments the finite-dimensional space must also account for the directional dependence of surface radiance functions; several avenues have been explored for doing this. Immel et al. <ref> [70] </ref> used subdivided cubes centered at a finite number of surface points to simultaneously discretize directions and 170 positions. Sillion et al. [149] used a truncated series of spherical harmonics to capture directional dependence and a quadrilateral mesh of surface elements for the spatial dependence.

Reference-contexts: See which embodies the same physical principles as Kajiya's rendering equation <ref> [71] </ref>. Equation (6.1) is essentially a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind; however it does not precisely conform to the standard definition because of the implicit function r 0 , which depends on the argument r and the dummy variable u 0 . <p> The abstraction afforded by operators is appropriate when the emphasis is on integrals as transformations rather than on the numerical aspects of integration. Operator equations were first applied to global illumination by Kajiya <ref> [71] </ref> although their connection with integral equations in general has been studied for nearly a century [17,15]. Equation (6.1) can be expressed as an operator equation in numerous ways. Here we shall construct the central operator from two simpler ones, each motivated by fundamental radiometric concepts. <p> The actions of all the operators are shown in Figure 6.5, where the dashed arrows indicate transitions in which information is lost, except in the case of diffuse environments. 6.5 The Rendering Equation The rendering equation, formulated by Kajiya <ref> [71] </ref>, is the form in which global illumination problems are most frequently posed; we now show that the rendering equation is equivalent to equation (6.8). To conveniently express the new equation, Kajiya introduced a number of multi-point transport quantities that differ from standard radiometric quantities [72]. <p> (r; q (r; r 0 )) b g (r; r 0 ) b k (r; r 0 ; r 00 ) cos 0 cos k (r 0 ; q (r 00 ; r 0 ) ! q (r 0 ; r)) These quantities correspond to the definitions given by Kajiya <ref> [71] </ref>, but are phrased here in terms of the two-point direction function q. <p> We shall only consider a well-defined class of global illumination problems. Specifically, we address the problem of approximating solutions to a form of the rendering equation <ref> [71] </ref> given imprecise data for geometry, reflectance functions, and emission functions. We further assume that the approximation is to be assessed quantitatively by its distance from the theoretical solution.

Reference-contexts: We summarize a few of the essential properties of normed linear spaces that pertain to radiative transfer. More complete treatments are given by Rudin [131] and Kantorovich <ref> [75] </ref>, for example. 6.3.1 Function Norms Infinitely many norms can be defined on a space of radiance functions, each imposing a different topology on the space as well as a different notion of size, distance, and convergence. <p> Equation (6.16) implies that jj Ah jj jj A jj jj h jj for all h 2 X. Operator norms also satisfy jj AB jj jj A jj jj B jj whenever the composition AB is meaningful; this property makes operator norms compatible with the multiplicative structure of operators <ref> [75] </ref>. Additional bounds pertaining to inverse operators can be deduced from these basic properties.

Reference-contexts: Inequality (6.17) is known as Ba-nach's lemma [109, p. 32]. A useful corollary of this result is the inequality k A 1 B 1 k 1 jj A B jj k A 1 k which holds under the same conditions as inequality (6.17) <ref> [77, p. 31] </ref>. 6.3.3 Norms of Special Operators K, G, and M 1 We now compute bounds for the operators K, G, and M 1 , which will be essential in deriving all subsequent bounds. <p> Given the L p bounds on K and G, we may now bound the operator M 1 , which maps surface emission functions to surface radiance functions at equilibrium. It follows from equation (6.22) and theorem 14 that M 1 exists and can be expressed as a Neumann series <ref> [77, p. 30] </ref>. Taking norms and summing the resulting geometric series, we have k M 1 k p 1 + ! + ! 2 + : : : = 1 ! for all 1 p 1, since k (KG) n k k KG k n ! n . <p> Although the proof of this theorem is given by Kato for finite-dimensional linear operators <ref> [77, p. 144] </ref>, and is left as an exercise by Dunford and Schwartz [41, p. 518], the general theorem for infinite-dimensional operators does not appear to be widely known. For completeness, a proof which parallels that given by Kato is included below.

Reference-contexts: These facts illustrate a third distinct class of errors. Because these errors arise from the practical limits of computational procedures, this class is called computational errors <ref> [91] </ref>. Computational errors perturb the discrete problem, and then preclude exact solution of the perturbed problem. We now look at examples of each of these.

In more abstract terms, boundary element methods are themselves projection methods whose role is to recast infinite-dimensional problems in finite dimensions. In this section we pose the problem of numerical approximation for global illumination in terms of projections.

Reference-contexts: This operator is most easily defined by specifying its action on an arbitrary field radiance function h: (Kh)(r; u) i Equation (6.5) is essentially the definition of a kernel operator <ref> [114] </ref>, with the minor difference that the position r acts as a parameter of the kernel; consequently, the integration is over a proper subset of the domain of h. The K operator maps the field radiance function h to the surface radiance function after one reflection (Figures 6.2b-c).

Reference-contexts: The latter assumption is an idealization since the physical process of reflection may involve some amount of sub-surface scattering <ref> [115] </ref>. Consequently, the points of incidence and reflection need not coincide for real materials. We shall ignore this effect here. 138 The function k has two crucial properties that follow from the thermodynamic principles of energy conservation and reciprocity.

More complete treatments are given by Rudin <ref> [131] </ref> and Kantorovich [75], for example. 6.3.1 Function Norms Infinitely many norms can be defined on a space of radiance functions, each imposing a different topology on the space as well as a different notion of size, distance, and convergence.

Reference-contexts: Such an approach may be useful for analyzing schemes in which geometry is simplified to improve the efficiency of global illumination, such as the algorithm proposed by Rushmeier et al. <ref> [133] </ref>. However, relating changes in geometry to bounds on the perturbation of G is an open problem, and solutions to this problem are likely to be norm-dependent. 7.3.2 Bounding Discretization Error In this section we study discretization errors introduced by projection methods.

Reference-contexts: For global illumination the space X n may consist of n boundary elements over which the radiance function is constant. Alternatively, it may consist of fewer boundary elements, but with internal degrees of freedom, such as tensor product polynomials [184], spherical harmonics <ref> [149] </ref>, or wavelets [53]. In any case, each element of the function space X n is a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions, u 1 ; : : : ; u n . <p> Immel et al. [70] used subdivided cubes centered at a finite number of surface points to simultaneously discretize directions and 170 positions. Sillion et al. <ref> [149] </ref> used a truncated series of spherical harmonics to capture directional dependence and a quadrilateral mesh of surface elements for the spatial dependence. As a third contrasting approach, Aupperle et al. [12] used piecewise-constant functions defined over pairs of patches to account for both directional and spatial variations. <p> For instance, the matrix elements in the Galerkin approach of Zatz [184] required four-fold integrals, which were approximated using Gaussian quadrature. Non-diffuse environ 173 ments pose a similar difficulty in that the matrix elements entail integration with reflectance functions <ref> [149] </ref>. Another form of matrix perturbation arises from simplifications made for the sake of efficiency. For example, small entries may be set to zero [94], or the entire matrix may be approximated by one with a more efficient structure, such as a block matrix [62] or a wavelet decomposition [53].

Reference-contexts: This application of the adjoint transport operator has been used in simulating diffuse environments by Smits et al. <ref> [151] </ref> and in non-diffuse environments by Aupperle et al. [12]. The approach is known as importance-driven global illumination. <p> Such problems are solved much more efficiently using the adjoint transport equation [87,153]. For global illumination, the direct and adjoint solutions can be used in conjunction by computing them simultaneously. This approach allows view-dependent solutions to be computed far more efficiently than either component in isolation <ref> [151] </ref>. In this section we consider only the algebraic properties of adjoint operators and show how they relate to the operators K and G.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm introduced by Cohen and Greenberg [31] for diffuse environments computed form factors at discrete surface points by means of a hemicube, which introduced a number of errors specific to this approach [18]. Errors are also introduced when form factors are approximated through ray tracing <ref> [171] </ref> or by using simpler geometries [62]. These errors can be mitigated to some extent by the use of analytic form factors [18,140], yet there remain many cases for which no analytic expression is known, particularly in the presence of occluders.

Reference-contexts: As a rule, we settle for solving "near by" problems for several reasons. First, the data used as input may only be approximate. For instance, reflectance and emission functions obtained through simulation <ref> [177] </ref> or empirically through measurement of actual materials or light sources [162,173] are inherently contaminated by error. A second reason that boundary data may be perturbed is that use of the exact data may be prohibitively expensive or even impossible.

Reference-contexts: For global illumination the space X n may consist of n boundary elements over which the radiance function is constant. Alternatively, it may consist of fewer boundary elements, but with internal degrees of freedom, such as tensor product polynomials <ref> [184] </ref>, spherical harmonics [149], or wavelets [53]. In any case, each element of the function space X n is a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions, u 1 ; : : : ; u n . <p> The use of higher-order basis functions was investigated by Heckbert [64] and later by Zatz <ref> [184] </ref> and Troutman and Max [164]. For diffuse environments with constant elements, the second inner product in equation (7.10) reduces to an area-to-area form factor. There are other possibilities for the linear functionals 1 ; : : : ; n . <p> For non-constant basis functions the form factor computations are replaced by more general inner products, which require different approximations. For instance, the matrix elements in the Galerkin approach of Zatz <ref> [184] </ref> required four-fold integrals, which were approximated using Gaussian quadrature. Non-diffuse environ 173 ments pose a similar difficulty in that the matrix elements entail integration with reflectance functions [149]. Another form of matrix perturbation arises from simplifications made for the sake of efficiency.
