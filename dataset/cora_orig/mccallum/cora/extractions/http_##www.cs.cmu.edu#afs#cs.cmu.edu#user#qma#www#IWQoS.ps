Abstract: Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing tries to select a path that satisfies a set of QoS constraints, while also achieving overall network resource efficiency. We present initial results on QoS path selection for traffic requiring bandwidth and delay guarantees. For traffic with bandwidth guarantees, we found that several routing algorithms that favor paths with fewer hops perform well. For traffic with delay guarantees, we show that for a broad class of WFQ-like scheduling algorithms, the problem of finding a path satisfying bandwidth, delay, delay-jitter, and/or buffer space constraints while at the same time deriving the bandwidth that has to be reserved to meet these constraints, is solvable by a modified version of the Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, we can identify from all feasible paths a path with the minimum hop count, or with the minimum length. Proof. The Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> (Bertsekas and Gallager, 1987) </ref> finds a shortest path step by step with increasing hop count: At the i-th step, a shortest path with at most i hops is found. The total number of steps is restricted to minfm; N g, where m is the number of nodes in the network.

Reference-contexts: Wang and Crowcroft (1996) suggest shortest-widest path. Gawlick et.al. (1995) propose to use shortest path with exponential cost function for permanent connections. Guerin et.al. (1996) suggest shortest-widest path. The dynamic-alternative path (Section 2) is based on results of dynamic alternative path for telecommunications networks <ref> (Gibbens and Kelley, 1988) </ref>. For traffic with delay guarantees, several studies propose heuristics to tackle the NP-complete problem (Jaffe, 1984; Salama, et.al. 1997). Rampal (1995) evaluates several path selection algorithms. Wang and Crowcroft (1996) gives a careful study of the complexity of QoS path selection.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm has been shown to be effective when selecting routes for high-bandwidth connections <ref> (Ma et.al, 1996) </ref>. Our study uses two topologies (Figure 1). The traffic load is a combination of audio and video sessions.
