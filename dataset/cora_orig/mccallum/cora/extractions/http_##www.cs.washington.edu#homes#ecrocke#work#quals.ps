Reference-contexts: Thus, a tool for finding novel approximate repeats in DNA is useful in discovering the function of the sequence. Numerous tools exist to find approximate repeats (see <ref> [1, 2, 4, 6] </ref>), but most of them do not allow for gaps in the motifs, and those that do allow for them only in a constrained way.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper I will describe the concept and implementation of an algorithm for finding motifs in DNA sequences, on which Martin Tompa and I have been working for approximately a year (see also <ref> [5] </ref>). This section will briefly describe the project concept as it existed when I began work on the project. The remaining sections highlight our progress on the problem during the time I was working on it. Section 2 will discuss some improvements made to the algorithm.
