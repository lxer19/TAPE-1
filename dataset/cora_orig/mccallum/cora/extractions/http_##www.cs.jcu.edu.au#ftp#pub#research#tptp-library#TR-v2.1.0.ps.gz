Reference-contexts: The resulting domain scheme reflects the natural hierarchy of scientific domains, as presented in standard subject classification literature. The current classification is based mainly on the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) [CBMN89] and the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) <ref> [AMS92] </ref> used for the Mathematical Reviews by the American Mathematical Society. Five main fields are defined: logic, mathematics, computer science, engineering, and other. Each field contains further subdivisions, called domains. Each domain is identified by a three-letter mnemonic.

Reference-contexts: The sparsness of research into ATP systems for FOF problems meant that no electronic collections of FOF test problems have previously been commonly available. A CNF problem library in electronic form was made publicly available by Argonne National Laboratories (in Otter format [McC94]) in 1988 <ref> [ANL] </ref>. This library was a major source of problems for ATP researchers. Other electronic collections of CNF problems are available, but have not been announced officially (e.g., that distributed with the SPRFN ATP system [SPR]). <p> In this field the source of the problem is acknowledged, usually as a citation. If the problem was sourced from an existing problem collection then the collection name is given in [ ] brackets. The problem collections used thus far are: * ANL the Argonne National Laboratory library <ref> [ANL] </ref>, * OTTER the collection distributed with the Otter ATP system [McC97] * Quaife Art Quaife's collection of set theory (based) problems [Qua92c] * ROO the problems used to test the ROO ATP system [LM92] * SPRFN the collection distributed with the SPRFN ATP system [SPR], * TPTP the problem first

Reference-contexts: In the same year [WM76] documented 86 CNF problems which have commonly been used for ATP testing. The problem clauses are not supplied in [WM76], however. A second major thrust was provided by [Pel86], which lists 75 problems in both FOF and CNF. Other more recent papers are <ref> [BEM + 86] </ref>, [Qua92a], [MW92], and [McC93], to name a few. The Journal of Automated Reasoning's Problem Corner also provided interesting challenge problems. Problems published in hardcopy form are, however, often not suitable for testing ATP systems, because they have to be transcribed to electronic form.

Reference-contexts: The significance and difficulty of a problem, with respect to the current state-of-the-art in ATP systems, is hard to assess by newcomers to the field. Existing test problems are often not adequate anymore (e.g., Schubert's Steamroller [Sti86]), while others may be solvable only with specialized techniques (e.g., LIM+ <ref> [Ble90] </ref>) and therefore are much too hard to start with. * are inconsistent in their presentation of equally named problems. Many copies and variants of the same "original" problem may exist in different collections. <p> References : General [Bou89, BM65, BB70], ATP -. ANA Analysis.

Problems in FOF, published by mathematicians and logicians prior to the mechanization of reasoning (e.g., <ref> [Chu56] </ref>) provided the first source for ATP researchers. The first major publication in this regard was [MOW76], which provides an explicit listing of clauses for 63 CNF problems, many of which are still relevant today 1 . <p> Indices : DDC 511.322, 512.817; MSC 03EXX, 04XX.

There are often many ways to formulate a problem for presentation to an ATP system. Thus, in the TPTP, there are often alternative presentations of a problem. The alternative presentations are called versions of the underlying abstract problem.

In the latter situation the TPTP size is that used in TPTP v1.2.0. For the other problems, the TPTP sizes chosen are non-trivial for the Otter [McC97] and SPASS [WGR96, Wei97] ATP systems. <p> the Otter [McC97] and SPASS <ref> [WGR96, Wei97] </ref> ATP systems, unless the problem remains easy upto sizes that have very large files. In the latter situation the TPTP size is that used in TPTP v1.2.0. For the other problems, the TPTP sizes chosen are non-trivial for the Otter [McC97] and SPASS [WGR96, Wei97] ATP systems. In the future these sizes might change in order to remove the current bias towards the Otter and SPASS systems.

Most of the problems in this domain identify conditions that make a near-Boolean algebra Boolean. Indices : DDC 512; MSC 03G15. References : General [HMT71], ATP <ref> [Win90] </ref>. SET Set Theory. Classically, a set is a totality of certain definite, distinguishable objects of our intuition or thought called the elements of the set. Due to paradoxes that arise from such a naive definition, mathematicians now regard the notion of a set as an undefined, primitive concept [How72].

Reference-contexts: The first major publication in this regard was [MOW76], which provides an explicit listing of clauses for 63 CNF problems, many of which are still relevant today 1 . In the same year <ref> [WM76] </ref> documented 86 CNF problems which have commonly been used for ATP testing. The problem clauses are not supplied in [WM76], however. A second major thrust was provided by [Pel86], which lists 75 problems in both FOF and CNF. <p> In the same year <ref> [WM76] </ref> documented 86 CNF problems which have commonly been used for ATP testing.

Other more recent papers are [BEM + 86], [Qua92a], [MW92], and [McC93], to name a few. The Journal of Automated Reasoning's Problem Corner also provided interesting challenge problems.
