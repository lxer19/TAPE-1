Abstract: Interconnection across administrative boundaries prompts the need for comprehensive policy enforcement (i.e., access control) with respect to inter-domain packet traffic. Due to the nature of the communication services they provide, stub and transit domains require different mechanisms for policing inter-domain traffic. This paper addresses the design of a policy enforcement mechanism geared specifically towards stub domains. With the aid of some basic concepts borrowed from Visa protocol[5], a much more powerful mechanism is developed and analyzed. Protocol implementation and experimental results are discussed. Keywords: inter-domain communication, authentication protocols, data integrity, commu nication security, network protocols, internetworking.

Reference-contexts: router is thus reduced to ensuring that a visa is valid and is being used correctly; the expensive part of the policy enforcement is done once per connection, by the ACSs of the end-point ADs, rather than once per packet, by the border routers. 1.2 History Previous work, in particular <ref> [5] </ref>, resulted in the development of two Visa protocol models based on different philosophies with regard to state in visa-routers. The original stateful model requires that participating border routers maintain reliable tables of active visas. In it, ACSs explicitly distribute visas to visa-routers. <p> This includes traffic flowing to and from equipped end-systems. Previous Visa protocol incarnations <ref> [5] </ref> dealt with this issue by ensuring data integrity and authenticity of the packets crossing AD boundaries. One deficiency in the previous design was the absence of any provisions for detecting replayed packets belonging to authorized connections.

Reference-contexts: Thus, each participant organization must reach its own tradeoff between autonomy and interdependence. The particulars of this tradeoff are embodied in what we refer to as policy. Consequently, policy enforcement refers to the application of policy to internetwork communication. A framework for internetwork policy enforcement is presented in <ref> [7] </ref> and a complete architecture based on this framework is described in [28]. This paper is concerned only with policy enforcement with respect to non-transit (i.e., stub) internetwork traffic. <p> In other words, the issue at hand is how an AD can control both inbound (addressed to a local end-system) and outbound (sourced by a local end-system) traffic at its network boundaries. According to the framework presented in <ref> [7] </ref>, the goals of a stub policy enforcement protocol are: 1. <p> Functionality the protocol must provide protection against: i) unauthorized AD entry/exit, and ii) modification, substitution and replay of legitimate inter-AD traffic. 3. Layering the entire protocol must be situated at the network layer. (The reader is referred to <ref> [7, 28] </ref> for the discussion of the motivating factors leading to this requirement.) 4. Efficiency the protocol overhead must be low enough so as not to affect the configuration of existing higher-layer protocols and applications. <p> As described in <ref> [7, 28] </ref>, transit policy enforcement in stub ADs also takes place at AD boundaries in entities referred to as Policy Gateways (PGs). As it turns out, each PG in a stub AD maintains a table of end-system pairs that are engaged in inter-AD communication.

Reference-contexts: However, ADs should be able to interconnect without exposing their internal resources to unrestricted external access. Moreover, internetwork components should be able to control incoming and outgoing traffic by specifying or constraining the ADs to, and through, which the traffic can flow <ref> [8] </ref>. While complete autonomy implies no interconnection, increased "openness" sacrifices autonomy. Thus, each participant organization must reach its own tradeoff between autonomy and interdependence. The particulars of this tradeoff are embodied in what we refer to as policy. Consequently, policy enforcement refers to the application of policy to internetwork communication.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Increasing use of computers for communication has prompted widespread interconnection of autonomous networks. In an environment of interconnected Administrative Domains (ADs), access to network resources is an issue of growing concern. In the absence of special mechanisms, network interconnection using existing internetworking protocols (e.g., IP [21] or OSI <ref> [10] </ref>) attempts to achieve full connectivity. However, ADs should be able to interconnect without exposing their internal resources to unrestricted external access. Moreover, internetwork components should be able to control incoming and outgoing traffic by specifying or constraining the ADs to, and through, which the traffic can flow [8]. <p> communication during connection setup * Additional packet length (additional length increases latency and decreases throughput) * Cost of recovery from router crashes 3 Network Environment We assume that the internetwork closely follows the model of the DARPA Internet [20], which is substantially similar to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model <ref> [10] </ref>. The essential features of this environment are: * End-systems are autonomous and cannot necessarily be trusted. * ADs are interconnected with routers; between any pair of end-systems in different ADs there are at least two routers, one belonging to each of the ADs.

Reference-contexts: With signatures based on conventional cryptography, fragmentation is a problem because only a visa-router can do it while preserving the data signatures. With public-key signatures, this is impossible, since only the originating end-system can compute the signature. Fragmentation is at best a necessary evil <ref> [12] </ref>; it is almost always better to set packet sizes at H src , to make the best possible use of the available bandwidth and to provide acknowledgements for each transmission unit.

Reference-contexts: Both timeliness and uniqueness of the VISA-REQUEST are inferred from the enclosed timestamp, T S a (using, for example, the loosely-synchronized clock scheme developed by Liskov et al. at MIT <ref> [14] </ref>). Next, ACS b authorizes communication between H a and H b . As before, this step is dependent on AD b 's policy. At last, when communication is authorized, ACS b issues a fresh visa in a form of a VISA packet. <p> Both timeliness and uniqueness of the VISA-REQUEST are established by examining the T S a field. Recall that T S a is the timestamp assigned by ACS a . ACS a is responsible for ensuring that it has never been used before. As described in <ref> [14] </ref>, ACSs's clocks are not necessarily closely synchronized, i.e., a certain clock skew is expected. We assume, there exists an upper bound (referred to as T ) on the clock skew between any two ACSs.

Reference-contexts: It may know the address of ACS b because of previous communication in which case VISA-REQUEST may be sent directly. It could also obtain ACS b 's address via a name service query <ref> [15] </ref>. Alternatively, VISA-REQUEST may be sent addressed to H b (the destination end-system). This is possible because visa-routers are required to reroute all VISA-REQUEST packets to one of the local ACSs.

Reference-contexts: Because a visa-key has to be kept secret to prevent interception by potential intruders, it is encrypted with ACS a public key. * T S a is the timestamp assigned to the visa by ACS a and approved by ACS b .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Increasing use of computers for communication has prompted widespread interconnection of autonomous networks. In an environment of interconnected Administrative Domains (ADs), access to network resources is an issue of growing concern. In the absence of special mechanisms, network interconnection using existing internetworking protocols (e.g., IP <ref> [21] </ref> or OSI [10]) attempts to achieve full connectivity. However, ADs should be able to interconnect without exposing their internal resources to unrestricted external access. <p> Network header is a different matter, however. A typical network-layer header contains addressing information such as source and destination end-system addresses, packet sequence number, packet length and other fields. (Figure 3 depicts the IP <ref> [21] </ref> datagram header, for example). Any header field not covered by the packet signature leaves a potential covert channel, since an intruder could trap a valid packet, change the unchecked field, and forward the modified copy without raising suspicion.

Reference-contexts: A router should assist in this by returning an error packet when it is unable to transmit a data packet without fragmenting it; in fact, the IP protocol includes a mechanism for doing so through the use of ICMP Destination Unreachable/Fragmentation Needed message <ref> [22] </ref>. 6.7 Loss of State Reliable state in visa-routers (i.e., visa-tables) is one of the fundamental features and requirements of Visa protocol presented in this paper. Nevertheless, it is unreasonable to expect visa-routers to be non-faulty at all times.

Reference-contexts: It also depends upon whether the operation involves passing over the entire or only part of, the packet. Furthermore, the cost of signature computation can be significantly more expensive than the cost of signature verification as in some proposed variations of RSA <ref> [24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An end-system may still need to use an authentication protocol (e.g., Kerberos <ref> [25] </ref>) to make sure it is really talking to the ACS. Since packet reception is a passive operation, the destination end-system is not required to initiate any actions. Of course, in most types of communication, packets flow in both directions, so each end-system is both a source and a destination.

Reference-contexts: Although methods have been proposed for accommodating fragmentation while preserving data signatures <ref> [26] </ref>, we insist that the source end-system avoid sending packets that will have to be fragmented.
