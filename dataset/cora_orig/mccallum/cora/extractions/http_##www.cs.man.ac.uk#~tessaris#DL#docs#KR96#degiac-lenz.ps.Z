Abstract: A Description Logic (DL) system is characterized by four fundamental aspects: the set of constructs used in concept and role expressions, the kind of assertions allowed in the TBox (assertions on concepts) and the ABox (assertions on individuals), and the inference mechanisms for reasoning on both the TBox and the ABox. Most of the research done in the last decade made several simplifying assumptions on the above aspects. However, the recent interest in DLs exhibited in many application areas (databases, software engineering, intelligent access to the network, planning, etc.) calls for investigating DL systems with full capabilities. The work presented in this paper represents a step in this direction. We present a sound, complete, and terminating (in worst-case EXPTIME) inference procedure that solves the problem of reasoning in a DL system with the following characteristics: it comes equipped with a very expressive language, it allows the most general form of TBox assertions, and it takes into account instance assertions on both concepts and roles in the ABox.

Reference-contexts: systems in many contexts, such as information systems (Catarci & Lenzerini, 1993), databases (Borgida, 1995; Bergamaschi & Sartori, 1992; Sheth, Gala, & Navathe, 1993), software engineering (De-vambu, Brachman, Selfridge, & Ballard, 1991), in telligent access to the network (Levy, Rajaraman, & Ordille, 1996; Blanco, Illarramendi, & Goni, 1994), action representation <ref> (Artale & Franconi, 1994) </ref>, and planning (Weida & Litman, 1992). Many of the above papers point out that the whole capabilities of a DL system (expressive language, TBox and ABox assertions) are often required in the corresponding application fields (see also (Doyle & Patil, 1991)).

Reference-contexts: We stress the importance of these additional constraints: indeed, a naive translation of individuals into atomic concepts, like the one implicitly done in Classic <ref> (Borgida & Patel-Schneider, 1994) </ref>, would not be sufficient for our purposes. Consider the knowledge base K constituted by the TBox and the ABox shown in Figure 4. The first inclusion assertion constrains the role succ and its inverse to be functionl.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, these investigations often refer to very powerful languages for expressing concepts and roles. The complete setting has been the subject of some investigations only recently. For example, in <ref> (Buchheit, Donini, & Schaerf, 1993) </ref> a DL system with both the TBox and the ABox is studied with a relatively powerful language (not including inverse roles) . However, results about reasoning on knowledge bases with both the TBox and the ABox are still rare.

Reference-contexts: We observe that such results would be very important in the light of the renewed interest in DLs that we find in disparate application areas. Indeed, DL systems are now advocated as suitable knowledge representation systems in many contexts, such as information systems <ref> (Catarci & Lenzerini, 1993) </ref>, databases (Borgida, 1995; Bergamaschi & Sartori, 1992; Sheth, Gala, & Navathe, 1993), software engineering (De-vambu, Brachman, Selfridge, & Ballard, 1991), in telligent access to the network (Levy, Rajaraman, & Ordille, 1996; Blanco, Illarramendi, & Goni, 1994), action representation (Artale & Franconi, 1994), and planning (Weida & Litman,

Reference-contexts: The size of both Pre (R) and Post (R) is polynomial in the size of R. For the roles in Post (R) the following two properties can be easily proven (see <ref> (De Giacomo, 1996, 1995) </ref>): * Let 9R.C be a concept. For all roles R 0 2 Post (R), 9R 0 .C 2 CL (9R.C ). * Let 9R 1 . : : : 9R l .C be a concept. <p> The following two propositions describe the basic properties of paths and can be proven by induction on the structure of the role R (see <ref> (De Giacomo, 1996, 1995) </ref>). Proposition 1 Let I be an interpretation and 9R.C a concept such that: s 2 (9R.C) I , (s) 2 Paths I (R), and s 2 C I .

Reference-contexts: As for ABoxes, in PDLs, they would roughly correspond to a partial specification of an actual evaluation of a program. However, such kind of specification have not been studied yet. The research in (De Giacomo & Lenzerini, 1994a, 1995; De Giacomo, 1995) has tackled these two aspects. In <ref> (De Giacomo & Lenzerini, 1994a) </ref> the EXPTIME-decidability of CIF , i.e. CIQ with number restrictions limited to unqualified functional restrictions (on both atomic roles and their inverse), was established. In (De Giacomo & Lenzerini, 1995; De Giacomo, 1995) this result was extended to CIQ.

Reference-contexts: This ability testifies the non-first-order nature of our logic. CIQ is indeed a subset of first order logic + fixpoints (see <ref> (De Gi-acomo & Lenzerini, 1994b) </ref> and not of the pure first order logic, as most description logics are. Finally, note that the knowledge base described in Figure 2 enjoys the finite model property. However, it easy to build a CIQ knowledge base with only infinite models.

Reference-contexts: Hence all models of the knowledge base are infinite. Observe that the existence of knowledge bases that admit only infinite models makes the reasoning methods based on the direct search and construction of a model (as the tableaux-based method in <ref> (Donini et al., 1994) </ref>) infeasible for CIQ.

Reference-contexts: The Fisher-Ladner closure <ref> (Fischer & Ladner, 1979) </ref> of a CIQ concept C is denoted by CL (C ) and is defined 1 This observation is originally due to Franz Baader. 2 We recall that the following equations hold: (R 1 ffi R 2 ) = R 1 ; (R 1 t R 2 ) <p> The size of CL (C ) is linearly bounded by the size of C (cf. <ref> (Fischer & Ladner, 1979) </ref>). By definition, if C 0 2 CL (C ), then CL (C 0 ) CL (C ).

Reference-contexts: In fact, most constructs in DLs have a counterpart in known PDLs as shown in Figure 3. In <ref> (Schild, 1991) </ref>, using the correspondence, many new results on DLs were obtained from known results on PDLs. In particular, from the decision procedures for Converse PDL, the first reasoning procedures for DLs that include inverse and TBoxes were devised.
