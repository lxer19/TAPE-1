Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 335 Appears in: IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, Washington DC, October 1995. Abstract We present an unsupervised technique for visual target modeling which is based on density estimation in high-dimensional spaces using an eigenspace decomposition. A computationally efficient and optimal estimator for a multivariate Gaussian distribution is derived. This density estimate is then used to formulate a maximum likelihood estimation framework for visual search and target detection. Our learning technique is applied to the probabilistic visual modeling and subsequent detection of facial features and is shown to be superior to matched filtering.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the eigenspace formulation leads to a powerful alternative to standard detection techniques such as template matching or normalized correlation. The reconstruction error (or residual) of the eigenspace decomposition (referred to as the "distance-from-feature-space" or DFFS <ref> [7, 6] </ref>) is an effective indicator of similarity.

Our approach is based on estimating the probability density or likelihood function of the target. <p> The ML estimate of the spatial position of the target is then obtained by (i fl ; j fl ) = arg max S (i; j; ) (14) 4 Experiments The eigentemplate approach to the detection of facial features in "mugshots" was proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>, where the DFFS metric was shown to be superior to standard template matching for target detection.
