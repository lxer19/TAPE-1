Abstract: This paper describes a text-based knowledge repre-sentaion system, capable of abductive inference. The system, called TextNet, uses the semantic information rendered by WordNet to process texts and to connect texts on the fly. Our system contains (1) a linguistic backbone, enhancing the semantics of WordNet 1.5., (2) corpora comprising indexed Treebank texts, html documents provided by web crawlers and (3) an inference module capable of abductions on the linguistic knowledge base. The inference system produces the representation of compound concepts by recognizing their typical functions. Knowledge shared, taught or expressed in natural language is considered to have by far the best expressiveness, although it is very ambiguous. Other representation formalisms eliminate the ambiguity aspect, but limit the wealth of knowledge communicated. Moreover, a tremendous effort is needed to translate in another representation scheme the immensity of facts and descriptions stated in the overflow of textual information characteristic to modern life. Since realistic knowledge bases have to be very large, it would be nice if we could take a modularized approach, that is to partition the system by domains. However, experience has shown that there are major problems with domain scalability; modest size systems working in restricted domains were successfully implemented, but they quickly failed when the domain changed slightly. Lenat (Lenat 1995) called this the brittleness problem. Another serious problem that hampers the scalability of knowledge representation systems is that reasoning is usually implemented with lots of rules encoding simple facts like "if it rains, then the lawn is wet". Since knowledge is infinite, it will not be possible to generate a complete set of rules. In fact, the number of rules gets quickly out of hand even for systems with modest capabilities. Moreover, combining inference rules from different domains generates correctness problems. Text-based Knowledge Representation Sowa (Sowa 1991) and Jacobs (Jacobs 1992) were among the first to suggest the use of natural language to represent knowledge. A knowledge representation system which uses textual information, called text-based intelligent systems ( TBIS ), may work like this: a text that represents domain, context or any other form of information is transformed by a natural language processing system into a knowledge representation. The sophistication of natural language processing may vary from simple tagging to "deep understanding", and this determines the power of such a system. Then, the user provides information also in the form of natural language. This information may be a query, or some utterance. The user's information needs to be transformed by the same natural language processing system in a form of knowledge. Then, the text and user representations are compared, and inferential information is extracted. Most likely, the TBIS approach still uses a knowledge base; however, the difference is that here the knowledge base is used only to interpret the text, and the text provides domain and context information. Thus, the knowledge base does not have to encode unnecessary facts and procedures. In this paper we describe a system that uses WordNet1.5 (Miller 1995) as the core linguistic knowledge base since it has a broad semantic coverage. Bridging the glossary definitions from WordNet with textual information generates a complex knowledge infrastructure.
