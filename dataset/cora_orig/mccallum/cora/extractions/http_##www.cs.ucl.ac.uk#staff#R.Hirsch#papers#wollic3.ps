Reference-contexts: In fact, a central problem of the area (for `cylindric algebras', due to Henkin, Monk, and Tarski) is to find a `simple intrinsic characterization' for these `representable' relation algebras. (There do exist intrinsic characterisations, in the form of first-order axiomatisations | see <ref> [16, 22, 4] </ref>, for example.) We approach this problem using model-theoretic forcing by games.

Reference-contexts: The method of games is well-known in model theory: see <ref> [8, 9] </ref>, for example. For the topological connections, via the Banach-Mazur theorem, see [23]. <p> Our methods seem very simple, and, as we will see, they are easily generalised to cylindric algebras. By theorem 3.5, RRA is an elementary class | it is axiomatised by some set of first-order sentences. Hence, by the downward Lowenheim-Skolem theorem (see <ref> [9] </ref>), it suffices to find axioms that hold in a countable relation algebra if and only if it is representable. The same goes for the simple representable relation algebras, as these also form an elementary class. As we said, we will begin with the `simple' case. <p> Hence A is representable iff A j= " n for all n. 6 Homogeneous representations Homogeneity is a second-order property of a representation. It has been extensively studied in model theory and permutation group theory (see <ref> [1, 9] </ref>, for example). Definition 6.1 Let A be a relation algebra, and let M be a representation of A. 1. <p> It can be shown that a countable relation algebra A has a homogeneous representation iff 9 can win H n (N; A) for all n &lt; ! and all one-point networks N . This uses Fraisse's well-known work on amalgamation and homogeneity (see <ref> [9, chapter 7] </ref>, for example), and a more complicated version of proposition 5.2, using (at least in our current proof) the compact topology on the Stone space of ultrafilters of A. <p> Proof. Construct a winning strategy along the ultrapower. The lemma actually holds where B is any !-saturated relation algebra elementarily equivalent to A. (Recall the standard fact that the ultrapower A ! =F is ! 1 -saturated. See, for example, <ref> [9] </ref>.) Lemma 8.7 Let B be any relation algebra such that 9 has a winning strategy for G a ! (B). Then there is a countable elementary subalgebra C of B such that 9 has a winning strategy in G a Proof.

So our question can be rephrased: if the term algebra of an atom structure C is representable, must the complex algebra over C be representable as well? Our knowledge here is as follows. See <ref> [10] </ref> for the proofs. * There are two countable relation algebras A; B with the same atom structure, A being representable, and B not representable. This is proved by the construction of [7] mentioned above.

We will describe a family of algebras discovered by Lyndon [17], which is a rich source of examples. <p> Remark 8.10 For each n &lt; !, the statement `9 has a winning strategy in G a n (A)' can be written as a first-order condition on A, in the manner of proposition 5.4. If we do so, we essentially obtain the so-called `Lyndon conditions', given in <ref> [15] </ref>, and claimed 4 there to axiomatise RRA. <p> The converse fails: a counterexample can be given by modifying a construction of Maddux [18], which in turn is related to one of Lyndon <ref> [15] </ref>. * We do not know whether S is elementary; this question was asked in [19]. We conjecture that it is not. Nor do we know whether it is closed under elementary equivalence, or whether membership of it is set-theoretically absolute.

Reference-contexts: The method of games is well-known in model theory: see [8, 9], for example. For the topological connections, via the Banach-Mazur theorem, see [23]. There are also precedents, such as <ref> [3, 14, 24, 25, 26] </ref> (to take just a few), for axiomatising the conditions for success in a game, still more sophisticated instances of which can be found in descriptive set theory.
