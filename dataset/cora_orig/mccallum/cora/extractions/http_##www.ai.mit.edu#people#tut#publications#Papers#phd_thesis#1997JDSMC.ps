Reference-contexts: zeros, such as the one illustrated in Figure 2b, can consist of two distinct parts: (1) a sequence of pulses, or pulse train, with a finite number of switches, followed by (2) a tail that is a linear combination of the initial condition response of components at the system zeros <ref> (Athans and Falb, 1966) </ref>. t output response input command t output response input command time-optimal command for a system with only poles A time-optimal command for a system with poles and zeros B Pontryagin's Minimum Principle reveals many helpful guidelines about the nature of time-optimal command profiles.

Reference-contexts: Scrivener and Thompson, in their literature survey of work in this area (Scrivener and Thompson, 1994), discuss a number of different techniques used to approach this problem. Although iterative or optimization techniques, such as the ones presented in <ref> (Balakrishnan and Neustadt, 1967, Meier and Bryson, 1990) </ref>, have been used to derive optimal commands for some systems, they are generally very numerically intensive and can be unreliable.

Reference-contexts: In brief, it is a mathematical statement of the fact that the time-optimal command must move the system from one point and bring it to rest at another. Previous work in the area of flexible system control, such as <ref> (Bhat and Miu, 1990, Magee and Book, 1993) </ref>, has noted that, for the case of flexible modes, this constraint can be implemented by designing an input command that has zeros at the complex system poles.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, by extending a command-generation technique called input shaping (Singer and Seering, 1990), Pao and Singhose have illustrated a similar practical approach for deriving time-optimal commands for flexible systems <ref> (Pao and Singhose, 1995, Singhose, et al., 1997) </ref> . As this overview of past work indicates, general but complex algorithms exist for solving the time-optimal control problem and many simple solution strategies have been developed for systems with flexible modes.

Reference-contexts: Most recently, a simple strategy has been proposed for deriving time-optimal commands for systems with any combination of denominator dynamics, not just system flexibility <ref> (Tuttle and Seering, 1996) </ref>. Following a similar approach, this paper proposes a technique for deriving time-optimal commands for systems with any type of linear dynamics, including numerator dynamics. <p> The task at hand, then, is to fashion constraint equations that ensure that the time-optimal command also has zeros at the system poles. As outlined in <ref> (Tuttle and Seering, 1996) </ref>, this condition can be enforced by the following expression: d u t sU s s p i = = = 0 , for i = 1, 2, ..., m, (3) where p i is the ith system pole, m is the total number of system poles, and <p> p i = = = - 0 1 For systems that have only nonrepeated poles and no zeros, this can be simplified further to yield: 10 st n j - = 0 , for i = 1, 2, ..., m, (8) which is identical to the result originally presented in <ref> (Tuttle and Seering, 1996) </ref>. By considering a system with only complex poles, this expression can be further simplified to reproduce the zero-vibration constraints proposed by (Singer and Seering, 1990) and others to create command profiles for systems with flexible modes.
