Abstract: This paper addresses the scalability of existing techniques for mobile robot navigation to work in large, unstructured environments. In particular, we are interested in the problem of relocalisation after the robot has been placed at some arbitrary location (unknown to the robot) in a previously explored environment. In the first instance, we assess the problems found when a system previously shown to work in a small-scale environment was transferred to a middle-scale environment. Through analysis of the results, we are able to show that successful performance in the middle-scale environment requires a global compass sense. We provide a suitable quantitative measure for assessing localisation quality in the larger environment, and are able to quantify post hoc the performance which would be obtained given an appropriate compass mechanism. In addition, we use the same quality metric to evaluate various different approaches for pre-processing the robot's sensory information.

Reference-contexts: Exploration was carried out using the translational and rotational motors located in the base of the robot. egy [2]. The robot begins by building a map of its environment, using a self-organising classifier mechanism to cluster its range-finding sensor readings. (The neural network classifier ART2 <ref> [1] </ref> was used in initial experiments; various other mechanisms are compared in section 4.) We then move the robot to some arbitrary position in the environment, its sensors being disabled during that move.

Reference-contexts: This work therefore represents a case study in attempting to quantify robot performance outside of the laboratory, and shows clearly that small-scale and middle-scale navigation present different sets of problems for mobile robotics researchers. In previous research <ref> [2] </ref> [3], we addressed the problem of combining exteroceptive sensory information (from the robot's range-finding sensors) with proprioceptive sensory information (from the robot's wheel encoders) to enable the robot to establish its location from an unknown starting position. <p> In these experiments, the turret was kept at a constant orientation to provide the robot with a "canonical view" of places, i.e., independent from the direction of travel. Exploration was carried out using the translational and rotational motors located in the base of the robot. egy <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Thus, the appearance of locations to the robot depended on the robot's position alone, not its orientation, providing the robot with a "canonical view" of places. In the small-scale experiments previously conducted <ref> [2] </ref>, no problem was found with angular drift of the robot's turret against the rotational movement of the wheel motors. However, this factor had a considerable impact on the middle-scale experiments presented here.

Reference-contexts: This is similar to the mapbuilding mechanism described by Kurz <ref> [4] </ref>, where the robot's (x; y) coordinates are averaged as the robot moves through a particular "situation area", i.e., an area of Cartesian space associated with a particular classifier category. A new place is entered into denote behavioural modules, and arrows the dependencies between different parts of the system. <p> However, we read of a far simpler classifier mechanism with similar properties in Kurz <ref> [4] </ref>, namely a simplified version of the Reduced Coulomb Energy network. Here, each prototype is simply a stored sensor image taken directly from the robot's range-finding sensor readings, and classification is decided by matching input patterns to the nearest stored prototype. <p> was significantly better than either the ART2 or RCE classifiers, although this was achieved at the cost of increased storage requirements and a computationally more expensive matching procedure. 5 The adaptive learning component and the additional "AND" layer from the more general RCE network were omitted here, as in Kurz <ref> [4] </ref>. 6 For ART2, vigilance = 0:90 yielded a map of 180 stored points.

Reference-contexts: Repeat from step 1. 3 shaded area shows the enclosure explored by the robot in these experiments (approximate size 25 m fi 20 m). occupied by the robot were manually logged by a human observer. At the same time, a "trace-replay" mechanism (as in Lee <ref> [6] </ref>) was used to record all of the sensory information available to the robot into a datafile at one second intervals. In order to synchronise the recording mechanisms of the robot and observer, the robot's voice synthesizer was used to continuously speak aloud the current time. <p> This is a familiar approach within mobile robotics, being used to combine position information from multiple sources of varying certainty [7]. This technique is often used in localisation systems which require a priori knowledge of the robot's position (e.g., Lee <ref> [6] </ref>), i.e, the robot starts off with a rough idea of its position, and the filter is then used to refine this position estimate on the basis of new perceptions.

However, the localisation system presented here is computationally much cheaper than more biologically plausible models of this kind, and is therefore probably better suited for use on a mobile robot which must map large areas.

Reference-contexts: Initially, an ART2 network had been chosen because it offered the potential for "lifelong learning", allowing new prototypes to be added without losing previously acquired sensor information. (This is in contrast to a fixed size classifier mechanism such as the self-organising feature map, as used in <ref> [9] </ref>). However, we read of a far simpler classifier mechanism with similar properties in Kurz [4], namely a simplified version of the Reduced Coulomb Energy network.

Reference-contexts: During both mapbuilding and relocalisation, the robot explores its environment using a reactive behaviour previously acquired using instinct rules <ref> [10] </ref>. In the experiments presented here, only wall-following was considered, although the system was shown previously to function independently of any particular exploration strat 1 Navigating in environments of several hundred m 2 in size. sonar and 16 infrared sensors are spaced at equal intervals around the turret. <p> After this adjustment had been applied, the map-builder was able to construct a map successfully from the data collected during one of the recorded laps of the environment. The remaining data was then used to test the relocalisation system. 4 3.2.2 Robot Drift In previous work (e.g., <ref> [10] </ref>), the rotational and turret motors of the Nomad 200 robot have been controlled in unison, so that the sensors always point in the same direction relative to the heading of the robot.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, no generally accepted quantitative measures of performance currently exist in the field for assessing the behaviour of the robot within the laboratory <ref> [11] </ref>, let alone "real world" environments. This work therefore represents a case study in attempting to quantify robot performance outside of the laboratory, and shows clearly that small-scale and middle-scale navigation present different sets of problems for mobile robotics researchers.

Reference-contexts: As in similar experiments conducted by ethologists (e.g., see <ref> [12] </ref>), a grid consisting of 24 contiguous zones was marked on the floor of the robot's environment. Each time the robot moved into a new zone, the current time and zone ceptually similar enough to be confused by the robot. 0. Initialisation.

Reference-contexts: The next question addressed was whether it is necessary to use a separate classification mechanism at all, instead of simply associating a separate stored sensor image with each of the place memories contained in the robot's map, as in the qualitative topological models of Zimmer <ref> [13] </ref>. The mapbuilder was modified so that each stored place contained its own individual prototype, unlike the ART2 and RCE classifiers, where one prototype could be associated with several different places in the map.
