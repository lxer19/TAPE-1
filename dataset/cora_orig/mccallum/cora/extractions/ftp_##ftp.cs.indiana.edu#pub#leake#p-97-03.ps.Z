Abstract: The case-based reasoning process depends on multiple overlapping knowledge sources, each of which provides an opportunity for learning. Exploiting these opportunities requires not only determining the learning mechanisms to use for each individual knowledge source, but also how the different learning mechanisms interact and their combined utility. This paper presents a case study examining the relative contributions and costs involved in learning processes for three different knowledge sources|cases, case adaptation knowledge, and similarity information|in a case-based planner. It demonstrates the importance of interactions between different learning processes and identifies a promising method for integrating multiple learning methods to improve case-based reasoning.

Reference-contexts: One possible way to alleviate this problem is to develop new methods for automatic learning of case adaptation knowledge. The DIAL system, our testbed case-based planner, uses a hybrid approach to learning adaptations <ref> [ Leake et al., 1996 ] </ref> , building initial adaptations by reasoning from scratch and then reusing adaptations by case-based reasoning. Learning of adaptation cases takes place in tandem with learning of plan cases to be reused by the normal case-based planning process [ Hammond, 1989 ] . <p> Surprisingly, however, adding case learning to adaptation learning (the method that performed best individually) produced only small additional speedup when compared with the best of the individual learning methods (adaptation learning) <ref> [ Leake et al., 1996 ] </ref> . We hypothesized that the problem might be caused by a mismatch between the system's similarity assessment criteria and the system's changing case adaptation abilities. <p> To link similarity assessment directly to adaptation knowledge, we developed a simple similarity assessment method called RCR (for Re-application costs and relevance) <ref> [ Leake et al., 1996 ] </ref> . RCR estimates the cost of performing adaptations by using simple case-based reasoning about the costs of previous adaptations. <p> More complete descriptions of the system are available in <ref> [ Leake et al., 1996 ] </ref> . 4 Types of learning Response plan case learning: DIAL begins its processing supplied with a small library of hand-coded disaster response plans, using a representation analogous to that used by CHEF [ Hammond, 1989 ] . <p> When DIAL is unable to generate a suitable plan autonomously, its plan library can be augmented by user-generated plans, increasing the range of problems the system can solve autonomously, as described in the following paragraphs. Adaptation case learning: As described in <ref> [ Leake et al., 1996 ] </ref> , DIAL's initial case adaptation knowledge is a small set of abstract transformation rules and a library of domain-independent "weak methods" for memory search (e.g., the "local search" strategy to find related concepts by considering nearby nodes in memory). <p> Generating response plans for these disasters required generating 119 adaptations, each of which was stored as a new adaptation case. These experiments extended the trials reported in <ref> [ Leake et al., 1996 ] </ref> , which processed 5 stories, resulting in 30 adaptation cases. Test runs were divided into two sets. <p> Figure 1 shows that both case learning and adaptation learning individually provide large efficiency increases over no learning (as expected), while adaptation efficiency with AL+CL provides smaller gains over adaptation learning alone. The results for the first four cases are consistent with those of <ref> [ Leake et al., 1996 ] </ref> . The fifth result, for AL+CL+RCR, suggests the potential benefits of directly linking similarity judgments to learned adaptation knowledge. The tests do not, however, address another crucial question: whether the combination of AL+CL+RCR improves overall planning performance.

Reference-contexts: Problems in the retrieved plan are detected by a simple evaluator for candidate response plans (based on the problem-detection process described in <ref> [ Leake, 1992b ] </ref> , and supplemented by inputs from a human user). When problems are found, a description of the problem in a pre-defined problem vocabulary is provided to the adaptation component. That component can either build up adaptations from scratch or by case-based reasoning starting from previous adaptations. <p> The indexing information includes a representation of the type of problem to adapt and information about the response plan for which the adaptation case was generated. The problem description information is similar in spirit to the problem vocabularies used to guide adaptation in other CBR systems (e.g., <ref> [ Leake, 1992b ] </ref> ), and serves as an index to guide retrieval of adaptation cases to use for new adaptation problems. The problem vocabulary divides problems according to categories such as UNAVAILABLE-FILLER and LACK-OF-ACCESS.

Reference-contexts: CBR systems rely on at least four types of knowledge: the case base, indexing scheme, similarity criteria, and case adaptation knowledge. Each of these types of knowledge provides an opportunity for learning. Consequently, a multistrategy learning approach <ref> [ Michalski and Tecuci, 1994 ] </ref> that improves multiple types of knowledge is promising for improving case-based reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Human disaster response planners appear to depend heavily on prior experiences when they address new problem situations <ref> [ Rosenthal et al., 1989 ] </ref> , making it a natural task domain for case-based reasoning. For example, when generating a response plan to bring help to an isolated area, a previously-generated plan for another isolated area may provide helpful information for planning emergency transportation.

RCR is in the spirit of Smyth and Keane's [1996] adaptation-guided retrieval, but learns about the difficulty of adaptations from experience rather than using static criteria to estimate adaptation cost.
