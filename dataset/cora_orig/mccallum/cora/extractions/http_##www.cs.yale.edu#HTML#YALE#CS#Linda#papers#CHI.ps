Reference-contexts: The 3D browser gives the Bauhaus user a sense of having a current virtual location in the Bauhaus hierarchy, and also a feeling of movement while navigating. The Bauhaus Visual Browser has been built using the HOOPS 3-D graphics package and is currently running on a Sparc Classic workstation <ref> [1] </ref>. MAP MAP is a visual programming environment in which the basic program constructs are represented by cubes in a 3D workspace. The workspace is used both as an editor for constructing programs, and as a visualization space for programs and their executions.

Reference-contexts: Our model uses a cube object for containment, and to indicate same level definition and a relationship among objects. We chose cubes as the basic "container" building block, because cubes can be used to build well-defined geometrical arrangements and are well suited to nesting <ref> [2] </ref>. Other objects, such as 2D tiles with text or pictures, are used to indicate non-recursive, primitive units of information. Unfortunately, text is not feasibly manipulable by the user in 3D without sacrificing speed and usability, so text is entered into these 2D tiles using a standard 2D text widget.

Reference-contexts: For example, giving a high-level "big-picture" view of the user's location can help prevent loss of context and help to maintain perspective. Systems like the File System Navigator [6] and Cone Trees <ref> [5] </ref> use such techniques effectively. Position Paper for CHI '95 Research Symposium (May 6-7, 1995, Denver, Colorado U.S.A.) The technique of zooming is used in the model to balance detail and abstraction in the display.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, multiple perspectives may be needed to provide the user with a sense of context in the information space. For example, giving a high-level "big-picture" view of the user's location can help prevent loss of context and help to maintain perspective.
