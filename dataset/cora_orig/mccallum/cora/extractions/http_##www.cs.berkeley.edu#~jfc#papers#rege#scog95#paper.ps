Abstract: This paper describes a complete and practical algorithm for the problem of geometric theorem proving. The algorithm works over algebraically closed fields as well as over the reals and takes care of degenerate cases. Our work is motivated by several recent improvements in algorithms for sign determination and symbolic-numeric computation. Based on these, we provide an algorithm for solving triangular systems efficiently using straight-line program arithmetic. The report concludes with a description of an implementation and provides preliminary benchmarks from the same.

Reference-contexts: We now have a collection of polynomials h 1 (s); : : : ; h n (s); g (s) whose signs we wish to determine at the roots of p (s) = 0. This can be done using the sign-determination algorithm of <ref> [1] </ref>. We then check the signs of g at the actual common roots of the h i as described in the overview. 7 Implementation In this section, we briefly describe a first implementation of the above algorithms.

Reference-contexts: system of hypotheses polynomial equations in triangular form, determine whether the set of their common zeros over the reals is contained in the set of real zeros of the conclusion polynomial. (One can use any standard algorithm for triangulating if the hypotheses are not triangular to begin with, see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). The observation here is that, in order to prove a theorem or refute it, one is only interested in the sign (+, or 0) of the conclusion polynomial at the real zeros of the hypotheses polynomials. <p> The paper is organized as follows : Section 2 gives the formulation of the problem of theorem proving we shall use. In section 3 we give an outline of the prover implemented by Chou <ref> [3] </ref>, since we shall use that as a benchmark to compare our prover with. Section 4 gives an overview of our theorem prover. Section 5 sketches the algorithm for solving triangular systems. <p> Several formulations of these two questions have been proposed [5], [6],[8]. See the book by Chou <ref> [3] </ref> for a discussion of the various formulations and the limitations of each. We will use the formulation used by Chou [3] which seems to be the one that is the most satisfactory : By a geometric statement (S) we shall mean a collection of polynomial equations h 1 (y 1 <p> Several formulations of these two questions have been proposed [5], [6],[8].

We will use the formulation used by Chou [3] which seems to be the one that is the most satisfactory : By a geometric statement (S) we shall mean a collection of polynomial equations h 1 (y 1 ; : : : ; y m ) = h 2 (y 1 ; : : : ; y m ) <p> Else it is not generally true. A geometric statement is generally false if g vanishes on none of the nondegenerate components of V. 3 3 The Ritt-Wu-Chou Prover In this section, we provide a brief description of the prover implemented by Chou <ref> [3] </ref> based on the work of Ritt and Wu. Among all the approaches that have been used and implemented, Chou's prover seems to be most complete and efficient and we will use this prover as the basis of comparison for our prover. <p> The basis of his work was a triangulation procedure which was implicit in the work of Ritt [11], [12] and which was given in detail by Wu. Wu's approach was implemented with various modifications and improvements by Chou in his prover [2], <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> A simple algorithm for triangulation is the following (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>, [4]) : Assume we are given a system of hypotheses polynomials as before, h 1 (u 1 ; : : : ; u d ; x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) = h 2 (u 1 ; : : : ; u d ; x 1 <p> If the system is irreducible and prem (g; f 1 ; : : : ; f n ) = 0, the following can be shown <ref> [3] </ref> 1. The geometric statement (S) is generally true in all fields 2. <p> Further, the benchmarks were obtained from a first implementation and we expect to reduce the running time by using various optimizations.
