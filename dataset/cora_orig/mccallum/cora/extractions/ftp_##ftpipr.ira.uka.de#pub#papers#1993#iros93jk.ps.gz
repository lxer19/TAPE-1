Abstract: In recent years there has been an increasing interest in applying machine learning techniques to robotics [14]. In this paper we present a new system architecture that enables a robot control system to learn on a symbolic level during planning and executing tasks. A user can program the robot by simply demonstrating the tasks it shall perform. By performing inductive generalization and specialization steps the system is able to improve its knowledge bases. The architecture consists of a set of distributed knowledge units which realize a focus of attention necessary for efficient execution and learning, and which also make a competition between different problem solutions possible.

The drawback of this approach is that if one graph has been selected to be followed, the execution is bound to that specific graph.

Reference-contexts: These visual descriptions can be enhanced later by results of experimentation (e.g. mass, center of gravity, face normals). Several descriptions of one view of a type of objects are then combined into a generic description by using an algorithm based on ideas of the conceptual clustering algorithm CLASSIT <ref> [11] </ref>. We extended the algorithm so that it is able to handle relational attributes in the matching step.

Reference-contexts: If this bound is exceeded, the task is regarded as unsolvable for the moment. 5.3 Learning Generic Object Descriptions In this paper we only state the main ideas that have been realized for learning generic object descriptions. Further details can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>. As we assume that there are no object models given a priori, a first module builds up generic descriptions (quantitative geometrical information and structural relations) consisting of a set of 2D-views for an object.
