Abstract: Weighted Myriad Filters have been proposed recently as a class of robust, nonlinear filters based on the statistical properties of ff-stable processes. These processes are very effective in modeling many real-world signals that are impulsive in nature. The class of Weighted Myriad Filters includes linear normalized FIR filters and is inherently more powerful than weighted median filters (which are constrained to be selection filters). This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the weights of the weighted myriad filter under the mean absolute error criterion. Necessary conditions for optimality of the filter are determined. Using an implicit formulation of the filter output, a gradient-based adaptive algorithm to obtain the optimal filter weights is derived. A simplification of this algorithm is then proposed in order to reduce the computational burden. The effective performance of the algorithms in impulsive environments is illustrated through computer simulations involving the filtering of noisy images.

Reference-contexts: III. Adaptive Filter Optimization The design of the optimal filter weights is an important problem that has not previously been addressed. A suboptimal approach called myriadization, described in <ref> [2] </ref>, is based on the fact that the weighted myriad filter behaves like a linear filter for large values of K, with improved robustness as K is lowered.
