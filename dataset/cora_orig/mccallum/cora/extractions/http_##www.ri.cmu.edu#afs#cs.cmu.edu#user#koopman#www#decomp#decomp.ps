Title: ABSTRACT  
Abstract: Designs are often decomposed into subdesigns in a divide-and-conquer approach to dealing with complexity. A wide variety of strategies are in common use for accomplishing decomposition. This paper describes a taxonomy of decomposition strategies based on the design attributes of structures, behaviors, and goals as an aid to understanding when each different strategy may be appropriate. The taxonomy is descriptive rather than prescriptive; it concentrates on providing a common ground for representing both business-driven and technically-driven design decisions. An example is presented that suggests hierarchically layering diverse decomposition strategies can accommodate diverse designs and design processes.

Reference-contexts: Con: Structures must be carefully designed to be scalable. In the mechanical and biological domains, the fact that volume increases more rapidly than surface area for many structures presents a limit to scalability (e.g., thermal transfer, ability to employ an exoskeleton). Am-dahls Law <ref> (Amdahl 1967) </ref>, which points out that adding replicated resources is vulnerable to even the slightest performance bottleneck, is a part of computer folklore that predicts true scalability can be very hard to achieve. Split Behavior/Goal Decomposition.

Reference-contexts: The control loops (behaviors) are associated with each group of structures, with higher levels providing supervisory control for multiple control loops. Design methods that advocate generating trial solutions and then performing evaluation <ref> (e.g., conceptual design in Pugh, 1990) </ref> can result in creating structure+behavior sub-designs that are then evaluated against goals at the system design level. The classical strategy of combining components from a catalog also fits into this category.

Reference-contexts: Structural Decomposition. Structural decomposition is exemplified by object-oriented analysis <ref> (e.g., Rumbaugh et al. 1991) </ref> as well as decomposing designs based on component location (e.g., the body of a container vs. its lid). Pahl & Beitz (1984) use a structural decomposition in the embodiment design phase when they consider the concept of function carriers.
