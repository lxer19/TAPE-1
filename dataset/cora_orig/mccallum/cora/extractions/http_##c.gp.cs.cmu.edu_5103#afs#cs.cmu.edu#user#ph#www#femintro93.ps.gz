Abstract: Most simulation problems cannot be solved symbolically, and must instead be solved numerically. In this chapter we explain some of the basics of the finite element method, a numerical technique for breaking up the domain of a problem into smaller pieces, thereby transforming one big problem into a number of simpler problems. In a differential equations course, one typically studies a few classes of problems for which there are closed form solutions, such as ordinary, linear differential equations with constant coefficients. Most problems of interest in real world simulation problems are much more complex, however, involving domains of two or more dimensions or nonlinear effects, yielding partial differential equations or nonlinear differential equations, respectively. Many phenomena in nature, such as heat conduction or convection, stress in mechanical structures, electromagnetic fields, and fluid mechanics are described by partial differential equations involving first and second spatial derivatives and time derivatives of multidimensional functions. Examples of such equations are Maxwell's equations, the heat equation, and the Schrodinger wave equation. Other physical phenomena, such as thermal radiation, are described by integral equations or integro-differential equations. Thermal radiation is the study of heat transfer by radiation. The character of the equations governing thermal radiation depends on whether the medium (volume) through which the radiation passes is a participating medium, which emits, scatters, or absorbs radiation, or a non-participating medium. An example of a participating medium is fog, and an example of a non-participating medium is a vacuum. Unlike conduction and convection, in which all flow of heat is determined by local phenomena (such as conductivity, pressure, or temperature differences in an infinitesimal neighborhood), thermal radiation is determined by non-local phenomena. The radiation incident on a surface is a function of the integral of the radiation on other surfaces. For these reasons, thermal radiation in a non-participating medium is governed by an integral equation, and thermal radiation in a participating medium is governed by a integro-differential equation. Neither differential equations, integral equations, nor integro-differential equations can be solved symbolically or analytically, in general. Nevertheless, we want to simulate these fl Appeared in Global Illumination course notes, SIGGRAPH '93, Anaheim, Aug. 1993

Reference-contexts: Introduction to Finite Element Methods 4-9 can be written in the form Fu = g, where F is a square matrix and g and u are vectors. There are many methods for solving linear systems of equations <ref> [Golub-Van Loan89] </ref>. For a general n fi n system, Gaussian elimination takes time O (n 3 ), but for some matrices, iterative methods such as Gauss-Seidel, Successive Overrelaxation, or the Conjugate Gradient Method yield adequate accuracy in time closer to O (n 2 ).
