Abstract: The RT programs provide means to obtain regression tree models based on samples of cases of any domain. To use these programs you should have at least a sample of cases contained in a file, plus another file were the variables of your regression problem are declared. These are the two files that you must have. Details on their format are given in Section 2. You may eventually have another separate sample of cases where you which to test the models obtained with the former sample using the RT programs. There are two separate programs that can perform this task. The first is the main program of the RT series, which is the rt program. This program not only learns a tree but also prunes it. If you wish only to learn a tree you may also use the rt_learner program that learns a full regression tree without pruning it. As it was mentioned in the previous section this can be done using the rt program, that learns a full tree and then prunes it. However, if you just wish to try different pruning strategies you may consider using only once the rt_learner program and then invoke several times the rt_pruner program to prune the tree using different pruning settings. The only difference between using rt_learner in conjunction with the rt_pruner , in comparison to using only the rt program, is computational efficiency. Apart from this the programs perform basically the same tasks.
