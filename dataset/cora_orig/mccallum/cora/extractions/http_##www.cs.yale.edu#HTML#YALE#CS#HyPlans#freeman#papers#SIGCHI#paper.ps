Title: Finding and Reminding Reconsidered  
Author: Scott Fertig, Eric Freeman and David Gelernter

Reference-contexts: We can all recall times when we needed information we threw away a week, a month or a year ago. In fact, Cook's work <ref> [1] </ref> has shown that archiving information can be critical in an organizational setting. Barreau and Nardi found that users in their studies did not archive or rely on archived information. Once again we believe these findings are artifacts.

Reference-contexts: Lifestreams Our own work, Lifestreams, is a new model and system for managing personal electronic information. Life-streams was first proposed in [3] and is described in <ref> [2] </ref>. Lifestreams uses a simple organizational metaphor, a time-ordered stream of documents, to replace conventional files and directories. The system acts as an electronic diary; every document you create is stored in your lifestream, as are all the documents other people send you.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, "whereis" and "Find" are hardly state of the art in logical search. More recent systems provide incremental indexing of file contents and significantly reduce search time while increasing accuracy <ref> [7, 4] </ref>. Inclusion of these better search techniques into current systems could sway results toward logical search. We don't argue that screen layout and organization based on conceptual locations isn't useful. In many cases it can help the user maintain a sense of context about his workspace. <p> Semantic File System The MIT Semantic File System <ref> [4] </ref> provides associative access to a file system via virtual directories. Using native directory commands (such as ls and cd), virtual directory names are interpreted as associative queries. The results of a query are computed via an automatically indexed set of attributes (field/value pairs).

Reference-contexts: Visual queries have been applied to a number of domains such as geographic database systems, movie databases, and educational applications. Visual queries have also been implemented in the form of a Unix directory browser <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We believe that conclusion three gives us a useful categorization of the user's information space and previous studies have reported consistent findings <ref> [6] </ref>. Conclusions one, two and four however, are artifacts of the narrow scope of the systems studied rather than general statements of the way users acquire, organize, maintain and retrieve information. Both studies focus on the common desktop metaphor which favors certain types of interaction over others. <p> Barreau and Nardi have dismissed archiving, questioning the "supposed coming information overload." By contrast, we have no doubt the problem is already here. We examine archiving further below. Reminding Malone <ref> [6] </ref> was one of the first to point out the importance of reminding in our paper-based systems and suggests their inclusion in computer-based systems. Yet today, software systems provide little support for reminding.
