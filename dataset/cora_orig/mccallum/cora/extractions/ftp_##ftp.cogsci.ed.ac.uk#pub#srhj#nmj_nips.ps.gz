Abstract: An extended version of the dual constraint model of motor end-plate morphogenesis is presented that includes activity dependent and independent competition. It is supported by a wide range of recent neurophysiological evidence that indicates a strong relationship between synaptic efficacy and survival. The computational model is justified at the molecular level and its predictions match the developmental and regenerative behaviour of real synapses.

Reference-contexts: Since Ca ++ is required for both the formation and maintenance of AChR aggregates, a feedback loop is possible whereby the bigger a patch is the more Ca ++ it will have available when the receptors are activated. Crucially, depolarisation of non-junctional regions blocks AChR expression <ref> (Andreose et al., 1995) </ref> and it is AChR activation at the NMJ that causes depolarisation of the postsynaptic cell.

Reference-contexts: Other work (Wallace, 1988) has provided insights into the mechanism used by agrin to cause the aggregation of the postsynaptic apparatus. Initially, AChR aggregates, or `speckles', are free to diffuse laterally in the myotube plasma membrane <ref> (Axelrod et al., 1976) </ref>. When agrin binds to an agrin-specific receptor, AChR speckles in the immediate vicinity of the agrin-receptor complex are immobilised. As more speckles are trapped larger patches are formed, until a steady state is reached.

Reference-contexts: An important connection made here is one between synaptic efficiency and junctional survival. Ca ++ and NO have both been implicated in Hebbian mechanisms <ref> (Bliss & Collingridge, 1993) </ref> and perhaps some of the principles uncovered here may be applicable to neuroneuronic synapses.

Reference-contexts: Paralysis or stimulation of selected motor units appears to favour the more active motor terminals <ref> (Colman & Lichtman, 1992) </ref>, while inactive axon terminals tend to coexist. Recent work also shows that active synaptic sites can destabilise inactive synapses in their vicinity (Balice-Gordon & Lichtman, 1994). <p> How do synapses make a distinction between synapses in their own terminal and those in others? There are two possibilities: (i) Synchronous transmitter release in the synaptic boutons of a motor neuron could distinguish synapses, allowing them to compete as cartels rather than individuals <ref> (Colman & Lichtman, 1992) </ref>. (ii) The synapses could be employing selective recognition mechanisms, e.g the `induced-fit' model (Ribchester & Barry, 1994). A selective mechanism implies that all the synapses of a given motor neuron can be identified by a molecular substrate.

Reference-contexts: Following removal of some motor axons at birth, the average size of the remaining motor units after withdrawal of polyinnervation is larger than normal <ref> (Fladby & Jansen, 1987) </ref>. This strongly suggests that individual motor axons successfully innervate more fibres as a result of the absence of their neighbours. It is appealing to interpret this as a competitive process where terminals from different axons compete for the same muscle endplate.

Reference-contexts: In paralysed systems, synapses will benefit from the AChR accumulating affects of the agrin molecules in those synapses nearby (i.e. those in the same terminal). It was suggested <ref> (Jennings, 1994) </ref> that competition between synapses of the same terminal was seen after focal blockade because active AChRs help stabilise the receptors around them and suppress those further away.

Reference-contexts: This fits in with the stabilisation role of Ca ++ in this model and the suppressive effects of depolarisation, as well as the physical range of these effects during `heterosynaptic suppression' <ref> (Lo & Poo, 1991) </ref>. It seems that Jenning's mechanism, although originally speculative, is actually quite a plausible explanation and one that fits in well with the extended DCM.

Reference-contexts: However, since agrin does not bind directly to the acetylcholine receptor, a different sort of reaction is required. 4.1 A DIFFERENT SORT OF REACTION If AChR is molecule B, and one agrin molecule can attract at least 160 AChRs <ref> (Nitkin et al., 1987) </ref> the simple reversible reaction of the DCM is ruled out. Alternatively, AChR could exist in either free, B f , or bound, B b states, being converted through the mediation of A. B b would now play the role of C in the DCM.

Reference-contexts: These findings support the idea that more active terminals have a competitive advantage over their inactive fellows, and that this competition takes place at a synaptic level. Activity independent competition has been demonstrated in the rat lumbrical muscle <ref> (Ribchester, 1993) </ref>. This muscle is innervated by the sural and the lateral plantar nerves. If the sural nerve is damaged the lateral plantar nerve will expand its territory to the extent that it innervates the entire muscle.

Reference-contexts: When this protein binds to the surface of the developing muscle, it causes acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), and other components of the postsynaptic apparatus, to aggregate on the myotube surface in the vicinity of the activated agrin.

Initially, AChR aggregates, or `speckles', are free to diffuse laterally in the myotube plasma membrane (Axelrod et al., 1976).
