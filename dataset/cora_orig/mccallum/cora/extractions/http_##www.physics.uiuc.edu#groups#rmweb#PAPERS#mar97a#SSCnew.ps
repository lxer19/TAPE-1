Abstract: Polarization, the dipole moment per unit volume of a material, is one of the basic quantities in physics which is essential to the theory of dielectrics, effective charges in lattice dynamics, piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity, and other phenomena. For extended matter such as crystals, however, a theory of polarization formulated directly in terms of the quantum mechanical wavefunction of the electrons has only recently been derived. Quantum mechanics is the problem: because the electrons do not belong to an individual unit cell of a crystal and their density is continuous, there is no way to uniquely "cut" the density and derive the dipole moment of a cell. The new approach consists in relating the change in polarization to the integrated bulk current flowing through the unit cell, and quantum mechanics provides the solution: unique expressions for the integrated current in an insulator can be found from a geometric Berry's phase involving integrals over the phases of the electronic wavefunctions. This method has been used to calculate many properties such as effective charges and ferroelectric moments, and also to discover new phenomena such as divergences of effective charges at magnetic phase transitions.

Reference-contexts: In a metal the electrons flow to completely screen any electric fields on a macroscopic scale. 3 However, in an insulator, charge cannot flow over large distances, and the charge density changes only by polarization of the medium. As discussed clearly by Landau and Lifshitz, <ref> [2] </ref> these properties of dielectrics are best described by defining the polarization density field P (r), which satisfies the equation r P (r) = n (r) ; (1) where n (r) is the charge density of the dielectric medium.

Reference-contexts: If the material is modeled as a sum of neutral polarizable units, there is no fundamental problem: the polarization is the sum of the dipole moments per unit volume and each dipole moment is well defined.

There is still one more requirement that must be imposed to make the definitions unique.

Reference-contexts: polarization can be uniquely derived in terms of the wavefunctions in the interior of the material (e.g., the wavefunctions in each unit cell of the periodic crystal with no need to explicitly consider surface effects). [7,8] This integrated current can be calculated using the properties of the quantum insulating state. <ref> [9] </ref> The result is that changes of polarization in an insulator can be found from the integrated current, which is given by a geometric Berry's 2 phase involving integrals over the phases of the electronic wavefunctions.

Reference-contexts: The integer multiples of 2 in the Berry's phase have an interesting interpretation. They correspond to the transport of an integer number of electrons across the entire crystal, which of course leaves the bulk invariant. This is the part of the transport that was emphasized by Niu and Thouless <ref> [11] </ref> quantized charge transport in an insulator (although they worked without assuming spin degeneracy). In contrast, the work described here emphasizes the changes in the Berry's phase by fractions of 2, which is the physical polarization of the crystal. 7 III.

Reference-contexts: The essential feature added by the expressions in terms of the geometric quantum phase, is the proof that the dipole moment of each neutral set of functions and nuclei in one unit cell is gauge-invariant and unique, despite the well-known non-uniqueness of Wannier functions themselves. <ref> [13] </ref> Therefore, this work provides a rigorous derivation of the polarizability models like those discussed in the textbooks (although the building blocks have a different meaning), [1-4] and explicit formulas for actual calculations.

Reference-contexts: The advance is that the geometric phase calculations are a simple addition to a standard density functional calculation and can readily be used to calculate non-linear polarizations to all orders.

Reference-contexts: Selected results are shown in Table III.
