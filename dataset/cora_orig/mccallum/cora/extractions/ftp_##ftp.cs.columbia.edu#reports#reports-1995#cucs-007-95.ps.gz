Abstract: This paper overviews a novel switching architecture for highspeed networks: Isochronets. Isochronets timedivide network bandwidth among routing trees. Traffic moves down a routing tree to the root during its time band. Network functions such as routing and flow control are entirely governed by band timers and require no processing of frame headers bits. Frame motions need not be delayed for switch processing, allowing Isochronets to scale over a large spectrum of transmission speeds and support all-optical implementations. The network functions as a media-access layer that can support multiple framing protocols simultaneously, handled by higher layers at the periphery. Internet-working is reduced to a simple medialayer bridging. Isochronets provide flexible quality of service control and multicasting through allocation of bands to routing trees. They can be tuned to span a spectrum of performance behaviors outperforming both circuit or packet switching.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 exemplifies two Isochronets realizations. Section 5 describes control mechanisms in necessary to operate Isochronets. Section 6 evaluates the performance behavior. Finally, Section 7 concludes. 2 Isochronets Operations 2.1 Routing on Trees Consider the motion of a frame in a store-and-forward or PacketSwitched (PS) network <ref> [2, 15] </ref>. The frame follows a path to its destination on a routing tree maintained by routers. It experiences random processing and queueing delays at nodes on its way, due to contention traffic. <p> The solution of such models is generally very difficult (see, for example, [12] for a discussion on the subject). For the mean queueing delay, we approximate the solution by the same method to compute the mean queueing time for M/G/1 systems with vacations <ref> [2] </ref>. In RDMA++ the vacation periods are generated only due to the ending of a band. <p> The calculation of this formula is as follows. We compute the mean residual service time for the busy and vacationing periods. For the busy period, the calculation is the same and gives the queueing delay for an M/D/1 type of system <ref> [2] </ref>. For the idle period, the mean residual service time is the mean vacation period ( V ) times the probability of being on vacation ( V ). <p> We then divide the mean residual service time by the idle period ( 1 - l ), to obtain the mean waiting time <ref> [2] </ref>. This last term can also be interpreted as the penalty in the delay incurred by the burst of cells generated during the vacations, present when the band begins.

Reference-contexts: In the limit, where contention is eliminated with high probability, the very value of store-and-forward with respect to a circuit-switched service becomes questionable. CircuitSwitched (CS) networks <ref> [3, 15] </ref> seek to provide absolute QoS by global resource reservations. Once a source establishes a circuit, traffic can move uninterrupted. Contention is elimi 4 nated in favor of long (larger than round-trip latency) admission delay and reduced bandwidth availability. <p> If the link is equally shared among 36 trees, this means that each tree can be allocated an average of 50100Kb. This average over time may result from allocations of varying sizes over periods of different duration. Voice and video traffic using ATM cells <ref> [3] </ref> may be allotted some 115230 cells in a green band repeated every 125s. Clientserver traffic using IP frames of 10 Kb may see a green-band of some 50100 frames per period of 10 P = 1.25 ms. <p> The study of such algorithms is left for future work. 6 Preliminary Performance Evaluation This section studies the performance of Isochronets using both analytical tools (Section 6.1) and simulations (Section 6.2). 6.1 Analysis This section studies a performance model of RDMA. Consider RDMA serving ATM cell <ref> [3] </ref> traffic generated from Poisson sources. Sources sending traffic to a given destination compete for 15 the use of a shared band subject to RDMA contention resolution.

Reference-contexts: For RDMA-, one can consider the band as a shared service mechanism. Cell arrivals to the band represent a renewal process. During transmission of cell, arrivals of other cells will be discarded by the RDMA-mechanism at switching nodes. One can use, therefore, Type-I Counter models <ref> [8] </ref> to represent RDMA-. In other words, a cell arrival may be considered as a counter mechanism which is blocked by a successful cell transmission. The process of interest is the arrivals of cells whose transmissions are successful.

Reference-contexts: We want to compute the number of queued elements at the end of a slot. If we consider the band to be large enough, the problem reduces to finding the average queue size in a M/D/1 queueing sys tem, which is simply <ref> [9] </ref> q = l - 2 ( 1 - l ) . The loss rate is just the mean queue size found at the end of a band divided by the number of packets sent during a band ( l B , where B is the band size). <p> CS has a similar behavior, the unstable point being 30%. RDMA++ has a stable performance. Both RDMA++&lt;c&gt; and RDMA++&lt;p&gt; have the same mean packet delay characteristics, as expected from queueing analysis <ref> [9] </ref>, and thus overlap in the figure. The Pr. curve plots the mean delay for priority traffic generated for the RDMA++&lt;p&gt; experiment. Priority was assigned randomly to ATM cells according to an uniform distribution.

WDM networks, like Isochronets, provide dedicated access to destinations via appropriate allocation of wavelength. Routing is accomplished by configuring nodes to switch wavelength to provide sourcedestination connectivity. <p> At the peer, packets need to be processed in order to determine the destination route. Isochronets do not require such processing and switch routing configurations over sufficiently long time periods to permit use of optical switches and, thus, all-optical networks. The Highball network proposal <ref> [10] </ref> bears some similarity to Isochronets. Nodes schedule traffic bursts by configuring the switches to support uninterrupted motion similar to train motions through intersections. Nodes broadcast requests to all other nodes, specifying their data transmission needs to all possible destinations.

Reference-contexts: The all-optical implementation discussed has all bands opened all the time, thus the synchronization problem is eliminated. There are two kinds of synchronization necessary for Isochronets operations: clock synchronization and band synchronization. To solve the clock synchronization problem, any of the traditional protocols such as the Network Time Protocol <ref> [11] </ref> may be used. The band synchronization mechanisms are discussed in this section.

Reference-contexts: The band may be viewed as a service mechanism with periodic vacations. This can be modeled as an M/D/1 queue with periodic vacations. The solution of such models is generally very difficult (see, for example, <ref> [12] </ref> for a discussion on the subject). For the mean queueing delay, we approximate the solution by the same method to compute the mean queueing time for M/G/1 systems with vacations [2]. In RDMA++ the vacation periods are generated only due to the ending of a band.

Reference-contexts: However, QoS can only be statistically guaranteed. The interruptions seen by a source depend on aggregated contention traffic of other random sources. Statistical QoS costs in increased admission delays, in reduced network utilization and in lower effective bandwidth seen by sources (for example, when leaky-buckets drip slowly <ref> [13] </ref>). In the limit, where contention is eliminated with high probability, the very value of store-and-forward with respect to a circuit-switched service becomes questionable. CircuitSwitched (CS) networks [3, 15] seek to provide absolute QoS by global resource reservations. Once a source establishes a circuit, traffic can move uninterrupted. <p> A PS network would have permitted the traffic burst to move into the network and utilize its entire band without pre-allocation. Typically, however, admission-control policies will prevent large bursts from entering the network. Such mechanisms as leaky-bucket <ref> [13] </ref> reduce the effective bandwidth available to any given source. A PS network governed by admission policies which limit source bandwidth, presents no advantage over an Isochronet which limits the bandwidth to sources through pre-allocation to routes.

That is, each source is allocated a circuit (priority band) to the tree root. The form of CS supported by Isochronets is superior to traditional CS as circuits only get priority over band usage but do not own it. <p> Consider now an Isochronet operating in RDMA++ contention resolution mode. If the entire band is allocated to contention traffic, frames moving down the tree will be stored and forwarded as in an ordinary packetswitched (PS) networks <ref> [15] </ref>. The form of PS supported by Isochronets is advantageous to traditional PS in a few ways. First, Isochronets support virtual cut-through mechanisms as frames arriving to a free switch will continue without store-and-forward delay. Second, no headers are processed in Isochronet switches.

Nevertheless, the design is more complex than the interconnection network presented.

Reference-contexts: One choice would have been a timedivided bus <ref> [18] </ref>. If n trees can simultaneously cross the switch, the bandwidth supported by the switching fabric is at least n times larger than the respective trunk bandwidth. <p> The concepts and protocols discussed below generalize to cases of varying periodicity and link speeds. 13 5.2 Band Synchronization This section considers the problem of synchronization in the electronic implementation of Iso-chronets (see reference <ref> [18] </ref> for an alternative protocol).
