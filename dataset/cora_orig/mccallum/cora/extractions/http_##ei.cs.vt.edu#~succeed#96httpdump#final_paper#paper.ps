Title: Network HTTP Packet Snooper  
Author: Roland Wooster, Stephen Williams, Patrick Brooks 
Keyword: HTTP, packet-filter, multi-threaded, pthreads, communication, tools, WWW, survey.

Abstract: The World Wide Web is now the dominant source of traffic on the Internet backbone, and may soon become the dominant source of traffic on local area networks as well. To better understand the characteristics of that traffic it is necessary to isolate HTTP packets from those of other network applications. We have constructed a tool that performs this function. The developed tool is experimentally compared with an existing tool set to analyze efficiency and performance.
