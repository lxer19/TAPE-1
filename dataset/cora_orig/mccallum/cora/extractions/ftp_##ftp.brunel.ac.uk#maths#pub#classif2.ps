Title: A classification of locally semicomplete digraphs  
Author: Jtrgen Bang-Jensen Yubao Guo Gregory Gutin Lutz Volkmann 
Abstract: In [19] Huang gave a characterization of local tournaments. His characterization involves arc-reversals and therefore may not be easily used to solve other structural problems on locally semicomplete digraphs (where one deals with a fixed locally semicomplete digraph). In this paper we derive a classification of locally semicomplete digraphs which is very useful for studying structural properties of locally semicomplete digraphs and which does not depend on Huang's characterization. An advantage of this new classification of locally semicomplete digraphs is that it allows one to prove results for locally semicomplete digraphs without reproving the same statement for tournaments. We use our result to characterize pancyclic and vertex pancyclic locally semicomplete digraphs and to show the existence of a polynomial algorithm to decide whether a given locally semicomplete digraph has a kernel.

Reference-contexts: Note that every strong round digraph is Hamiltonian. Theorem 2.1 [2] A local tournament is round if and only if N + (v) and N (v) induce transitive tournaments for every vertex v 2 V (D). This result was proved for tournaments in <ref> [1] </ref>. By Theorem 2.1, if a local tournament is round, then there exists a unique (up to cyclic permutations) round labelling of D. We refer to this as the round labelling of D.

Reference-contexts: It is an easy exercise to show that each of these results also hold for semicomplete digraphs a slight generalization of tournaments in which there is at least one arc between each pair of distinct vertices. In <ref> [2] </ref> the first author proved that the characterizations for Hamiltonian path and cycle in tournaments extend to locally semicomplete digraphs for every vertex x the set of in-neighbours as well as the set of out-neighbours of x induce a semicomplete digraph. <p> He also showed that several other properties of tournaments hold for locally semicomplete digraphs as well. Since their introduction in <ref> [2] </ref>, locally semicomplete digraphs have been extensively studied, see e.g. [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 8, 19, 20, 23]. Locally semicomplete digraphs are interesting, not just because they are a natural generalization of tournaments, but also because of their underlying undirected graphs. <p> Our proof is based on ideas from [4] and [12]. The concept of a locally semicomplete digraph was recently used in [5] to obtain a new type sufficient condition for general digraphs to have a Hamiltonian cycle. In <ref> [2] </ref> it was shown that there are infinite families of strong locally semicomplete digraphs which are not pancyclic and two sufficient conditions for a locally semicomplete digraph to be pancyclic (see Corollaries 4.7 and 4.8) are given. <p> Note that every strong round digraph is Hamiltonian. Theorem 2.1 <ref> [2] </ref> A local tournament is round if and only if N + (v) and N (v) induce transitive tournaments for every vertex v 2 V (D). This result was proved for tournaments in [1]. <p> Theorem 2.2 [21] Every strongly connected semicomplete digraph is vertex pancyclic. 3 Structure of locally semicomplete digraphs In this section we provide a useful classification of locally semicomplete digraphs (see Theorem 3.12). We begin with the structure of non-strong locally semicomplete digraphs. Theorem 3.1 <ref> [2] </ref> Let D be a connected locally semicomplete digraph that is not strong. <p> In the rest of the section we consider the structure of strong locally semicomplete digraphs. We start with a lemma from <ref> [2] </ref>. Lemma 3.4 [2] Let D be a strong locally semicomplete digraph and S a minimal separating set of D. Then D S is connected. <p> In the rest of the section we consider the structure of strong locally semicomplete digraphs. We start with a lemma from <ref> [2] </ref>. Lemma 3.4 [2] Let D be a strong locally semicomplete digraph and S a minimal separating set of D. Then D S is connected. <p> The following two partial results from <ref> [2] </ref> on pancyclic locally semicomplete digraphs are immediate consequences of Theorem 4.6 (a digraph D is chordal if U (D) is chordal, i.e. it has no induced cycles of length more than 3): Corollary 4.7 If a strong locally semicomplete digraph is chordal then it is pancyclic.

Reference-contexts: In [19] Huang characterized local tournaments, i.e. locally semicomplete digraphs without 2-cycles. This is a deep and difficult result. Unfortunately, Huang's characterization, which involves arc-reversals, cannot be easily applied to solve other structural problems on locally semicomplete digraphs. In <ref> [4] </ref> it was shown that Huang's characterization actually implies another classification of locally semicomplete digraphs which is very useful in the study of structural properties of locally semicomplete digraphs. In this paper we prove a more precise classification theorem without using Huang's result.
