Abstract: With the widespread use of full-text information retrieval, passage-retrieval techniques are becoming increasingly popular. Larger texts can then be replaced by important text excerpts, thereby simplifying the retrieval task and improving retrieval effectiveness. Passage-level evidence about the use of words in local contexts is also useful for resolving language ambiguities and improving retrieval output. TEXT PASSAGES AND TEXT RELATIONSHIP MAPS With the advent of full-text document processing, the interest in manipulating text passages rather than only full-text items has continued to grow. Retrieving large texts in answer to user queries tends to be inefficient because the user is then forced to cope with large masses of text, and ineffective because relevant text passages often provide better answers than complete document texts. In addition, passage-level evidence accounting for word usage in local text environments is often helpful in improving retrieval effectiveness, because the meaning of ambiguous terms becomes clear when the local context is properly specified. [1-6] text passages, a study of text passages is also important for determining overall text structure. A structural decomposition of texts into passages may then reveal information about the type of text under consideration, and knowledge of text type and text structure in turn affects many text handling operations, including retrieval, text reading and traversal, and text summarization. The structure of individual texts, or sets of related texts, can be studied by using a text relationship map that exhibits the results of similarity measurements between pairs of texts, or text excerpts. Typically, each text, or text excerpt is represented by a vector of weighted terms of the form D i = (d i 1 ; d i 2 ; :::; :::; d i t ) where d i k represents an importance weight for term T k attached to document D i . The terms attached to documents for content representation purposes may be words or phrases derived from the document texts by an automatic indexing procedure, and the term weights are computed by taking into account the occurrence characteristics of the terms in the individual documents and the document collection as a whole. [7] Figure 1 shows a typical text relationship map for six texts included in the Funk and Wagnalls encyclopedia dealing with the general topic of Nuclear Energy. The documents appear as nodes (vertices) in the graph of Figure 1, and a link (branch) appears between two nodes when the similarity between two texts is sufficiently large. The similarity threshold used to build the map of Figure 1 is 0.01, that is, all branches representing a text similarity above 0.01 are shown on the map. Figure 1 shows that the similarity measure between documents 17012 and 17016 (Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Weapons) is a high 0.57, whereas no significant similarity exists between 8907 (Nuclear Fission) and 22387 (Thermonuclear Fusion).

Reference-contexts: However, the subject matter may not be treated in a linear fashion in many written texts. In other words, one would not necessarily expect that segments are always coextensive with text themes. <ref> [15] </ref> To obtain the text themes, attention must be paid to mutually linked text pieces that are not necessarily adjacent in the text. One possibility consists in locating all triangles in the full text relationship map, where a triangle is a set of three mutually related paragraphs. <p> Each triangle can then be represented by a centroid vector defined as the average for the three vectors in the triangle; and triangles can be merged when the similarity between the corresponding centroid pair exceeds a given threshold. <ref> [15] </ref> The merging process is continued for higher-order structures until no further merging is possible. A typical theme is shown by dashed lines in Figure 6, consisting of paragraphs 17016.p5, p29, p30, and p35.

Reference-contexts: When the themes cover adjacent text pieces, such a mixed retrieval strategy provides a useful approach to text retrieval. <ref> [16] </ref> Consider as an example a query dealing with the revolutionary war processed against encyclopedia article 859 (American Revolution). Table 1 contains the size of the query similarities for various passages of document 859. <p> Text traversal implies a type of speed reading where an area of interest is specified, and the best text passages representing that area are chosen in response. Text summarization is a related problem where a set of text passages is used that collectively represents the full text. <ref> [16] </ref> In dealing with text traversal, it is necessary to distinguish the so-called global paths, that operate on a complete text, from paths restricted to some substructure, such as paths within themes or within segments. In either case, many different traversal orders can be considered, the most important being: 1.
