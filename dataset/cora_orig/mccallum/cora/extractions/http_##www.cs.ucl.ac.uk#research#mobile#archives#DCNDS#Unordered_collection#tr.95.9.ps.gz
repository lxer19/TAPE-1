Abstract: This paper presents a connection management architecture for handling mobility in a radio network environment. A new concept of per roaming entity software agent, known as mobile representative, is used for insulating fixed network entities from the effects of user mobility. It is shown that mobile representatives can be used for distributing mobility management load within fixed backbone network, depending on the instantaneous physical locations of mobile terminals. The paper describes a representative management architecture followed by a novel connection caching strategy which is used for achieving low-latency and scalable connection handovers.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multimedia networking is an emerging technological trend of the 1990s and there exists an increasing demand for supporting multimedia traffic in wide and local area wireless network environment <ref> [1] </ref>. By now it has began to be understood that in order to guarantee the strict performance requirements of multimedia traffic, connection oriented approaches [2] are more efficient compared to conventional datagram based networking.

Reference-contexts: By now it has began to be understood that in order to guarantee the strict performance requirements of multimedia traffic, connection oriented approaches <ref> [2] </ref> are more efficient compared to conventional datagram based networking. However, designing connection oriented wireless networks requires to overcome some serious restrictions imposed by mobility of the roaming network users. <p> In addition to a complex routing policy, during relocation of the end users of a connection the end-to-end connectivity needs to be maintained by performing a signalling operation, known as handover <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. This paper presents a mobility management architecture for supporting connection oriented multimedia streams in a radio network environment. In addition to tackling the mentioned problems, the present architecture attempts to achieve the following design goals. <p> This requires a BS to create and maintain a handover signalling connection with an MR, if there exists at least one mobile connection segment between them. Sudden failure of a radio link, constituting a part of the active path of a mobile connection, triggers a without hint handover <ref> [2] </ref>. On the other hand, when quality of the radio link between an MU and a BS degrades gradually, the MU may like to handover few or all of its connections to another BS with better radio link with it.

Reference-contexts: The network consists of large number of very small transmission cells, often referred to as pico-cells. The spatial as well as temporal profiles of the pico-cells within a building are highly irregular and unpredicatable because of complicated terrain and attenuation characteristics <ref> [4] </ref> of the building materials. To partially mitigate this unreliability, caused by unpredictable pico-cell characteristics, a cell overlapping strategy is introduced where an MU is likely to be seen simultaneously by multiple base stations.

Reference-contexts: Pico-cell overlapping is also used as a key component while designing low-latency handovers, described in Section 7. In a single carrier frequency scenario <ref> [5] </ref>, however, the cost paid for this is a reduction of overall radio frequency reuse efficiency. Along with the non-mobile network entities, each MU is assigned with a globally unique network layer address which is independent of the instantaneous geographical location of the MU. <p> Note that the present mobility management architecture does not assume any specific medium access or data-link layer protocol and thus it could be implemented on top of a wide range of lower layer protocols (as in <ref> [5] </ref>) which can accommodate the mentioned cell overlapping feature. 3 Mobile Representative While setting up a mobile connection 1 , the source and intermediate network entities need to know about the location of the end mobile unit in order to route the connection.

Reference-contexts: At other extreme, an MR closely follows its client MU and usually resides within its geographically nearest possible stationary entity. While yielding a better location update performance, this approach fails to ensure the mobility hiding feature of the representatives. An intermediate measure is taken in the current implementation <ref> [6] </ref>, where an MR is arranged to be much less mobile than its client MU and a representative migration takes place only when its client MU relocates to a new geographical or administrative domain. <p> Only the connection management related operations of the location server are highlighted in this section. For details about the location server design and its implementation, the reader is referred to <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition to maintaining distributed location information, the location server also aids the MRs to keep up-to-date location information about their respective client mobile units. A CLS needs to supply the following information to a location query client. <p> If the local search fails, it consults the relevant remote CLSs to acquire the necessary information for the querying client. More about the distributed query searching and location update strategies are presented in <ref> [6] </ref>. 5 Representative Management Creation and migration are identified as the primary management operations associated with a representative process. Creation: Both during initial creation and migration, new host for a representative is chosen by the appropriate cluster location servers. <p> However, inter-cluster location and representative migration management operations are much more complicated compared to the intra-cluster ones. More details regarding a prototype implementation of the described architecture and its performance can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. 8 Concluding Remarks This paper presented a design of a connection management architecture for supporting mobility in a radio network. A concept of mobile representative, for making mobility transparent to non-mobile network entities, has been introduced.
