Title: Understanding the Role of Negotiation in Distributed Search Among Heterogeneous Agents

Abstract: In our research, we explore the role of negotiation for conflict resolution in distributed search among heterogeneous and reusable agents. We present negotiated search, an algorithm that explicitly recognizes and exploits conflict to direct search activity across a set of agents. In negotiated search, loosely coupled agents interleave the tasks of 1) local search for a solution to some subproblem; 2) integration of local sub-problem solutions into a shared solution; 3) information exchange to define and refine the shared search space of the agents; and 4) assessment and reassessment of emerging solutions. Negotiated search is applicable to diverse application areas and problem-solving environments. It requires only basic search operators and allows maximum flexibility in the distribution of those operators. These qualities make the algorithm particularly appropriate for the integration of heterogeneous agents into application systems. The algorithm is implemented in a multi-agent framework, TEAM, that provides the infrastructure required for communication and cooperation.

Reference-contexts: It can occur at either the domain or control level of problem-solving. Laasri et. al. describe the recursive negotiation model , a general model of multi-agent problem solving that details various situations that can potentially benefit from negotiation <ref> [ Laasri et al., 1992 ] </ref> . In examining this model, it becomes clear that negotiation is a pervasive process that remains relatively untapped by current computational systems.

Reference-contexts: The negotiated-search algorithm has been successfully incorporated into two implemented systems. In [ Lan-der and Lesser, 1992b ] , we describe distributed search in the context of a seven-agent steam condenser design system and discuss how different operator/agent assignments within the negotiated-search algorithm affect problem solving. In <ref> [ Lander and Lesser, 1992a ] </ref> , a two-agent contract negotiation system is presented, and negotiated search is compared to a search strategy that is tailored to characteristics of that environment.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, sharing information that will specifically help another agent avoid future conflicts is generally cost effective since it eliminates the expense of generating unproductive solution paths <ref> [ Lander, 1993 ] </ref> . In negotiated search, an agent that receives conflict information from another agent can choose whether or not to prune its own search to respect that information (see Section 4.5). Multiple solution paths can be concurrently investigated in negotiated search. <p> Con-currency requires that TEAM have mechanisms for handling conflicts that occur due to the simultaneous development of extending proposals and criticisms. These mechanisms are discussed in <ref> [ Lander, 1993 ] </ref> . 4 Negotiated Search Operators In this section, we present a detailed description of the negotiated-search operators. Notice that the operators depicted in Figure 1 work at the surface level of problem solving: they move a particular solution through various states to a termination state. <p> Then the 4 Using the number of processing cycles as a heuristic is a simplistic approach. More sophisticated mechanisms for applying problem-state relaxation based on characteristics of problem-solving situation, rather than on time, are discussed in <ref> [ Lander, 1993 ] </ref> . 5 This is a simplified version of the TEAM termination policy that integrates agent acceptability and, optionally, a domain-dependent global evaluation of solutions. algorithm loops through the following sequence until a set of minimum and maximum values is found or until it is determined that no <p> TEAM supports the dynamic selection of a search algorithm, thereby enabling an agent set to switch to a customized algorithm if the requirements for application of the algorithm are met.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The current state of knowledge-based technology is such that almost every application system is built from scratch. In order to move beyond the prohibitive cost of constantly reinventing, rerepresenting, and reimplement-ing the wheel, researchers are beginning to examine the feasibility of building application systems with reusable agents <ref> [ Neches et al., 1991 ] </ref> . A reusable agent is designed to work without a priori knowledge of the agent set in which it will be embedded, instead using a flexible, reactive approach to cooperation.
