Abstract: This paper presents an algebraic approach to the specification and verification of distributed technical systems, which are controlled by a central control program. The approach is demonstrated by its application to the case study "production cell". The approach uses first-order specifications to describe the possible behaviour of the system. Specifications are structured according to the physical structure of the system. A PASCAL-like program is used to enforce intended behaviour. The whole case study, including specification as well as verification of lifeness and safety conditions, is carried out using the KIV system.

Reference-contexts: A separately developed control program over the specification, implemented in a PASCAL-like notation is used to enforce intended behaviour. Verification of lifeness and some aspects of safety has been done using the KIV system ([HRS 89], <ref> [HRS 90] </ref>, [Re 92]), a system designed for the development of correct software systems. The system supports structured first-order specifications and a tactical theorem proving approach for program verification based on Dynamic Logic ([Ha 79]). The following section describes the intended state oriented model for the system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The case study "production cell", as described in <ref> [Li 93] </ref>, [LL 94], was treated by the KIV group to study how distributed systems can be modelled within first-order logic, and which requirements for the correctness of a central control program can be expressed and verified using the KIV system.
