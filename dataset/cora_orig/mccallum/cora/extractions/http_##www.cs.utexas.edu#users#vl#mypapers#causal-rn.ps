Abstract: The McCain-Turner semantics of causal rules is based on a fixpoint construction similar to the one found in the definition of default logic. In the special case when the heads of the rules are literals, it can be equivalently expressed by a translation from sets of rules into sets of propositional formulas. In this note, we define a translation from causal logic into classical logic that characterizes the semantics of arbitrary causal rules, without any restrictions on their syntactic form. This translation suggests a way to extend the McCain-Turner logic to nonpropositional causal theories.

Reference-contexts: In the special case when the heads of the rules are literals, the semantics can be equivalently expressed by a translation from sets of rules into sets of propositional formulas. This translation, called "literal completion," is similar to the completion process used in logic programming <ref> [ Clark, 1978 ] </ref> . <p> Moreover, we will see that even in Example 3, where one of the rules includes a predicate variable, completion does not introduce any new higher-order variables and thus leads to a simple result. The main new feature of literal completion in comparison with the completion process defined in <ref> [ Clark, 1978 ] </ref> is that the "completed definition" of a predicate constant P consists of two equivalences, one "positive" and one "negative." The algorithm takes any definite causal theory T as input.

Reference-contexts: In the modification described below, we distinguish between "explainable" symbols|those whose values must be causally explained by the given rules|and "nonexplainable" ones. The formulation of causal logic presented in this note serves as the basis of a new action language in the style of <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1993 ] </ref> , in which the concurrent execution of actions can be described, and both actions and fluents can be represented by expressions with parameters. This is the subject of a forthcoming paper.

Reference-contexts: Then rule (4) tells us that, after performing the action, there is a cause for the fluent to hold. Rule (6) expresses that this fluent is "false by default"|that it is "momentary" in the sense of <ref> [ Lifschitz and Rabinov, 1989 ] </ref> . This interpretation is appropriate, for instance, if Q (x) represents plucking string x on the guitar, and P (x) means that string x sounds.

Reference-contexts: Their work builds on the analysis of causality due to Hector Geffner [1990], on work by Fangzhen Lin [1995] and on their own research described in <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> . The main idea of this theory is to distinguish between the claim that a proposition is true and the stronger claim that there is a cause for it to be true.

Reference-contexts: This translation, called "literal completion," is similar to the completion process used in logic programming [ Clark, 1978 ] .

First, they are nonpropositional. Second, in these examples we distinguish between the explainable symbols (P ) and the nonexplainable symbols (Q); as pointed out in the introduction, McCain and Turner require a causal explanation for every symbol. <p> The language will include a second sort of variables, for natural numbers, and each of the predicates P , Q will get a second argument of this new sort. We will follow the style of formalization proposed in <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997a ] </ref> , except that the availability of variables will allow us to replace an infinite set of axioms by a finite one. Example 3. <p> The need to have formulas more complex than literals in the heads of causal rules arises, for instance, when an explicitly defined symbol is added to the language <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997a ] </ref> ; a definitional extension of a causal theory is not definite. The process of completion described below turns any definite causal theory into an equivalent set of sentences of classical logic. <p> Since the heads of the rules of T m+1 do not include explainable symbols, it follows that T 0 is equivalent to the conjunction of all completion sentences for T . 7 Relation to the McCain-Turner Definition The semantics of causal rules according to <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997a ] </ref> can be defined as follows. Let T be a set of propositional causal rules. For any interpretation I of the language of T , let T I be the set of the heads of all rules of T whose bodies are satisfied by I.
