Abstract: Variable Bit Rate (VBR) transmission is widely regarded as the best solution for the transport of compressed image and video data, both in terms of network utilization and quality of data decoded at the receiver. However, significant problems remain unsolved to make this a viable approach. One of these problems is that of efficiently matching characteristics of the VBR source to those of the channel, in order to maximize end-to-end system performance. In this work, we propose a model for the channel based on which the source can make optimal decisions regarding bit allocation and rate control. This model consists of N queues, for each of which the source negotiates with the network statistical performance guarantees, consisting of allowable average transmission and packet loss rates. Based on such a channel description, the source determines how to allocate packets to each queue, to minimize the expected distortion of the images reconstructed at the receiver. A provably optimal algorithm for computing such bit allocations is the core of this work. Simulation results are presented.

Reference-contexts: The need for unequal protection against channel errors has been recognized before, but the solutions so far proposed are based on the use of error correcting codes (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>). We propose to explore a more general approach, which has a strong practical appeal: given a set of connections with unequal QoS guarantees, send important cells through more reliable connections, less important cells through less reliable connections. <p> This approach is complementary to the work on Priority Encoding Transmission, in the sense that we model the network in a way analogous to the probabilistic PET systems proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> to perform optimal rate control. <p> These connections can be simulated over a single high-speed wire using a protocol such as PET <ref> [1] </ref>, or could be two separate ATM connections for which the source negotiated with the network different quality parameters, or could even be a pair of standard Internet connections one using TCP and the other using UDP; how they are implemented is immaterial to our work.

Reference-contexts: The physical encoder and decoder buffer sizes B e i i are assumed large enough so that the bottleneck during a transmission is given solely by the capacity of the link. It has been proved before <ref> [2, 3] </ref> that under the assumption of large enough encoder/decoder buffers, the VBR LB channel (with LB buffer size L max and encoder buffer size B e ) is equivalent to a CBR channel with LB buffer size L max + B e . <p> Leaky Buckets for Multiple Queues.

Our work generalizes <ref> [2] </ref> in some aspects, but considers only special cases of that work in others. <p> However, while in <ref> [2] </ref> the optimization problem is solved for a large class of policing functions and without assuming large enough physical encoder/decoder buffers, we restrict our attention to the LB case with large physical buffers. 3.2.1 Problem Formulation The optimal rate allocation is given by the solution s fl to the following optimization
