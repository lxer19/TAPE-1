Abstract: We give a method for determining a set of images which are consistent with measured projections data and error bounds on the projections noise. The error bounds can account for both statistical noise uncertainty and model uncertainty, e.g. due to a mismodeled or uncalibrated system matrix. If one knows the statistical distribution of the projections errors, then one can select the error bounds to give a consistency set which is a (1 ff)% confidence region on the true image given the measured data. This region is a "set estimate" of the image which can be used to study confidence levels of popular image reconstructions such as filtered back projection, weighted-least-squares, and maximum likelihood. Alternatively, the set estimate can be used as a feasibility region from which particular image estimates can be selected based on additional criteria. We provide some numerical results for parallel ray projection geometries with Poisson projection statistics.

The quantiles can be used to develop a confidence region on the true image given the measured data set, and they have the advantage of less sensitivity to the accuracy of the assumed noise model than a detailed parametric description. <p> As long as N p, after N steps the EPC yields the minimal volume ellipsoid containing fl.

For comparison the general (no exploitation of sparse A) MLEM algorithm needs N (2p 2 + 2p) flops per iteration and may in some cases require several thousand iterations to converge.

Note that the EPC curve is monotone decreasing from iteration 1 to iteration 1000.
