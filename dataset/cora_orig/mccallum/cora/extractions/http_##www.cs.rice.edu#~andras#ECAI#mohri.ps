Title: Weighted Automata in Text and Speech Processing

Abstract: Finite-state automata are a very effective tool in natural language processing. However, in a variety of applications and especially in speech precessing, it is necessary to consider more general machines in which arcs are assigned weights or costs. We briefly describe some of the main theoretical and algorithmic aspects of these machines. In particular, we describe an efficient composition algorithm for weighted transducers, and give examples illustrating the value of de-terminization and minimization algorithms for weighted automata.

Reference-contexts: Formally, this corresponds to changing the semir-ing of the weights. The algorithms we present here work for any semiring. Finite-state models have been used widely in speech recognition for quite a while, in the form of hidden-Markov models and related probabilistic automata for acoustic modeling <ref> [1] </ref> and of various probabilistic language models.

Reference-contexts: An important reason for those successes is that complex acceptors and transducers can be conveniently built from simpler ones by using a standard set of algebraic operations | the standard rational operations together with transducer composition | that can be efficiently implemented <ref> [4, 2] </ref>. However, applications such as speech processing require the use of more general devices: weighted acceptors and weighted transducers, that is, automata in which transitions are assigned a weight in addition to the usual transition labels.

Reference-contexts: We have used transducers of that and related forms to map context-independent phonetic representations to context-dependent representations for a variety of medium to large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. We are thus able to provide full-context dependency, with its well-known accuracy advantages <ref> [7] </ref>, without having to build special-purpose context-dependency machinery in the recog-nizer. The transducer D from phone sequences to word sequences is defined similarly to A.
