Abstract: Published as: F.C. Berger and Th.P. van der Weide. A Feedback Mechanism for Query by Navigation. Technical Report CSI-R9413, Computing Science Institute, University of Nijmegen, Abstract The Two-Level Hypermedia Paradigm sees an Information Retrieval System as consisting of a document network (the Hyperbase) and a descriptor (term) network (the Hyperindex). Query by Navigation is a process whereby the searcher gives a description of the Information Need by travelling through the descriptor network. This paper presents a formalism for expressing the effects of traversing the Hyper-index on the elements of the Hyperindex. This formalism makes use of probabilities for mod-elling the searcher's behavious. The events which can occur during the search process are discussed and modelled. Some important properties, which are reasonable to demand of a retrieval system, can be proven to be valid if this formalism is adopted. A mechanism for assigning a measure of relevance to documents is presented. This uses the formalism mentioned above. An example will show the effectiveness of The aspect of relevance feedback and its role in Query by Navigation is introduced by examining the different level on which the searcher can offer information for weeding out unwanted sections of the search space. In order to illustrate the workings of Query by Navigation a small example is included.

Reference-contexts: In section 6 we return to relevance feedback, only now we look at it from the document level Finally, in section 7 an example is used to illustrate the workings of Query by Navigation. 2 Search path modelling In the earlier paper <ref> [BHW94] </ref> we introduced the concept of Query by Navigation. There we likened using an information retrieval system to a traveller who travels through Europe by train. Suppose a traveller departs by train from Amsterdam. One could ask what the probability is that the searcher's final destination is, say, Rome.

Reference-contexts: We assume for each transition e a probability q e &gt; 0 of occurring. In a transition network, for each state a: X q a!b = 1 The transition matrix T is then defined for descriptors as (see <ref> [GS92] </ref>): Definition 2.1 T (x; y) = &lt; q e if x and y are connected via edge e 0 otherwise 2 The transition from the start state to a descriptor d occurs under a probability s d .

Reference-contexts: Moving toward Vienna next can be seen as having the effect of increasing Rome's target probability. Moving in another direction, e.g. Brussels, is translated to a decrease in Rome's target probability. Basically, there are two types of usage of an information retrieval system: searching and browsing <ref> [LZ93] </ref>. To illustrate the process of searching with this example, consider a traveller who wants to travel to, say, Athens. At each station, the traveller has to determine whether or not he or she is in Athens. If so, the final destination has been reached.

Reference-contexts: The continuation from e to d is introduced as: Definition 2.2 C e (d) = i=0 2 The infinite sum 1 P T i (e; d) converges to (I T ) 1 (e; d) = M (e; d)(see <ref> [Tri82] </ref>). This requires the calculation of the inverse matrix of an jDj fi jDj matrix. Lemma 2.1 C e (d) = M (x; d)h d An important property of the matrix M is that the diagonal element of a column is the maximum of that column.
