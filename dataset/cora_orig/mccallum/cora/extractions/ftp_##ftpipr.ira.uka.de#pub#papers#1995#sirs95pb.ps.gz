Abstract: The application of manipulators in unknown or rapidly changing environments requires fast sensors and data evaluation as well as reactive integration into the robot control system. This paper describes an artificial sensitive skin mounted on a robot manipulator developed in order to achieve this purpose. By totally covering a body with tactile sensors every contact may be detected immediately. When evaluated reactively local integration leads to the immediate contact termination by causing a movement of the related robot joint. On the other hand, the skin may be used to establish or improve a map of the environment by selecting and executing appropriate exploratory movements. Experimental results are included to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed sensory system.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, the disadvantage of the high amount of friction which is caused by the rough surface of the rubber can be compensated by covering it with the foil. 3 Reactive Planning and Execution The reactive planning and execution architecture for integrating the sensory data is presented in detail in <ref> [1] </ref>. The architecture has been developed for a redundant manipulator.

Reference-contexts: Often, cameras are used in such systems (see [7] for an exhaustive overview of camera based manipulation systems). However, the robot arm itself often hides critical areas. Thus, this approach is not suitable in situations where the constant survey of the whole manipulation area is required.

On the other hand, as pressure and position can't be measured simultaneously, another preprocessing task of the microcontroller is the initializing of the position measurements as soon as the pressure exceeds a certain threshold.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of sensor-based reactive control for autonomous mobile robots operating in an uncertain environment has been a topic of active research in recent years. ([5], <ref> [9] </ref>) There exist only very few approaches to use sensors for reactive control of manipulators in uncertain environments. Often, cameras are used in such systems (see [7] for an exhaustive overview of camera based manipulation systems). However, the robot arm itself often hides critical areas.

Reference-contexts: As soon as the environment is substantially altered (e.g. considering manipulation inside elastic material) the situation classes have to be extended covering the new contact classes. This pragmatic approach was preferred to a complete formal classification as proposed by <ref> [10] </ref>, as the realization of this complete classification proved to be rather slow. The class point stands for a one point contact which is consequently detected by one sensor. Several exploration movements might be used to determine whether a contact really is a one point contact.
