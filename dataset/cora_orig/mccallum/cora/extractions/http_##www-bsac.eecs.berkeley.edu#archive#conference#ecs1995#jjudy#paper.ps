Abstract: Electroplated magnetic films have been integrated with silicon-based surface micromachining to fabricate magnetically actuated microexure structures. Both the frame-plating technique and also a less complex one- mask plating process have been used to electrodeposit NiFe onto polysili- con exures coated with Cr-Cu seed layers. The microactuators are released by removing the underlying sacrificial layer in a hydrouoric-acid etch. The microactuators described in this paper are potentially useful in microphotonic systems as well as other applications.

Reference-contexts: After a thick layer of photoresist (~10 mm) is spun on and patterned to form the plating mask (Fig. 4b), NiFe is electroplated onto the exposed areas of the seed layer using the procedure described by Ahn, Kim, and Allen <ref> [2] </ref> (Fig. 4c). A second layer of photoresist is spun on and patterned to protect the areas of the electrode- posit inside of the photoresist frame. The unprotected NiFe is removed by a subsequent wet-chemical etch which also removes the revealed areas of the seed layer (Fig. 4d).

Reference-contexts: Torsional microstructures that have potentially useful applications in microphotonics, such as for optical-beam chopping, scanning, and steering, have also been investigated <ref> [7] </ref>. A torsional device, shown in Fig. 2, with a 400 mm-long NiFe plate attached to a pair of 400 mm-long torsional beams has been driven out of the plane of the wafer into a verti-cal position by an external magnetic field of ~8 kA/m.

A theoretical model [7] has been formulated that takes into account the affect of the demagnetizing field and magnetic anisotropy on the magnitude and direction of the net magnetization vector inside the magnetic material.

Reference-contexts: However, magnetically hard films, specifically Co and its alloys, may have certain advantages in these microactuators and thus are a subject of present investigation. FABRICATION The microactuators are produced by adding fabrication steps to a process that had been developed at BSAC to produce polysilicon resonant microstructures <ref> [8] </ref>. All new steps, many of which are borrowed from the magnetic-recording head fabrication process, are added near the end of the fabrication sequence, just prior to the micromechanical- device release step. This processing sequence prevents the magnetic material from contaminating the conventional microelectronic and micromechanical fabrication steps.
