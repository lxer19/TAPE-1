Abstract: Collaborative filtering is based on the premise that people looking for information should be able to make use of what others have already found and evaluated. Current collaborative filtering systems provide tools for readers to filter documents based on aggregated ratings over a changing group of readers. Motivated by the results of a study of information sharing, we describe a different type of collaborative filtering system in which people who find interesting documents actively send "pointers" to those documents to their colleagues. A "pointer" contains a hypertext link to the source document as well as contextual information to help the recipient determine the interest and relevance of the document prior to accessing it. Preliminary data suggest that people are using the system in anticipated and unanticipated ways, as well as creating information "digests".

Reference-contexts: The World Wide Web allows nearly anyone with a machine on the Internet to create hypertext multimedia documents and link them to other documents at other sites <ref> [1] </ref>. The Web, started in 1990, had grown to more than 4600 servers in October 1994, and over 10,000 servers in December 1994. Together, these servers make over 1.05 million different documents available for retrieval [11]. Usenet Net News is also growing exponentially.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the benefit of "active" collaborative filtering increases with the divergence of documents that are found. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM The design of the system was informed by the results of a recent study of information retrieval behavior in a customer support group <ref> [2] </ref>. Contrary to the expectation that support people use online or printed documentation to help answer customer's questions, Ehrlich and Cash report that the support people rely on each other to diagnose and solve customer problems, as well as find and interpret formal and informal documentation. <p> The system automatically extracts the information from the pointer and formats it into the digest. 5 Mail / Distribute Information Digest Private Database Group Database Pointer FIGURE 2 : Different ways of distributing a pointer . As we found in <ref> [2] </ref>, there are people who excel at pulling together bits of information from many places. On Usenet Net News, these people appear as the ones who pull together FAQ's (Frequently Asked Questions) for newsgroups. <p> In a rough survey we found that people in a workgroup of 10 people received 5-10 pointers per week. Approximately 80% of those pointers were sent out by just one person. That person thus serves a similar role to the "information mediator" we identified in <ref> [2] </ref>. He routinely browsed a few key databases such as the newswire database and sent pointers, including comments, to documents he thought were relevant.

Reference-contexts: Ensuring the quality of information passed on to customers is well known to librarians for whom source validation is an important part of their job <ref> [3] </ref>. The system described in this paper was developed around three key ideas that we felt were missing from existing informal methods of sharing references. 1.

However, these systems all suffer from a "cold-start'' problem.

Reference-contexts: Giving searchers access to this usage history lets them take advantage of the type of subtle hints that we commonly use when making read/don't read decisions in the real world. Tapestry The concept of collaborative filtering originated with the Information Tapestry project at Xerox PARC <ref> [5] </ref>. Among its other features, Tapestry was the first system to support collaborative filtering in that it allows its users to annotate the documents they read.

Reference-contexts: Until systems such as the NetNews collaborative filter are well in use, there are uncertain rewards for any user who participates. The lack of a clear reward system can be a major barrier in the acceptance of a groupware application <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Collaborative filtering works in part by associating with computer documents the history of their use. For instance, Hill et al make the observation <ref> [7] </ref> that the objects we use in everyday life accumulate wear and tear as a normal part of their use: pages in books become wrinkled, bindings creased, and margins smudged with fingerprints.

Reference-contexts: Several simple systems have been developed to help users format and distribute these hotlists to others, thereby spreading information about good documents on the Web. Another example in the World Wide Web context is Simon <ref> [8] </ref>. Users of this system create "subject spaces'' which are effectively lists of hypertext links to the interesting World Wide Web pages that have been found, and comments on those documents.

Reference-contexts: Collaborative Filtering Of Usenet Net News A further collaborative filtering system for Usenet Net News was created to scale up to a critical mass of users by branching out to more sites, and providing those users with a simpler method for accessing articles <ref> [10] </ref>. This system modified two common Net News readers to provide collaborative filtering functions: voting and 2 display of articles based on their "popularity''. Aside from these extra functions, the news readers appear and handle as they did before.

The problem gets worse when one considers all the information that organizations are putting online in file folders, databases and Lotus Notes amongst other repositories.

Reference-contexts: We begin by reviewing existing information filtering systems. INFORMATION FILTERING If the problem is that people are swamped by too much information <ref> [12, 16] </ref>, the solution seems to lie in developing better tools to filter the information so that only interesting, relevant information gets through to the user. Many present filtering systems are based on building a user profile. <p> Having the users who find the information also responsible for sending it to colleagues contradicts a common theory on improving information systems. Namely that information finders should be freed from the task of addressing mail and coming up with recipients <ref> [16] </ref>. Yet, at least one of our studies showed that often users really do have recipients in mind for the information they discover, and we believe our active collaborative filtering system serves users well by allowing them to easily act on this knowledge.
