Title: PYRAMID BROADCASTING FOR VIDEO ON DEMAND SERVICE  
Author: S. Viswanathan T. Imielinski 
Address: New Brunswick, NJ 08903  
Affiliation: Dept of Computer Science Rutgers University  
Abstract: The proposed scheme of pyramid broadcasting is a new way of rendering Video On Demand service at metropolitan scale. In pyramid broadcasting, the most frequently requested movies are multiplexed on the broadcast network, resulting in radical improvement of access time and efficient bandwidth utilization. We provide analytical and experimental evaluations of pyramid broadcasting based on its implementation on ethernet LAN, illustrating its advantages.

Data Centered solution can be implemented in ATM using broadcast or multicast facilities and create "subject based" connections.

Reference-contexts: It is usually the case that most of the demand (80 %) is for a few (10 - 20) very popular movies 1 , like the new releases and the top ten movies of the season/year <ref> [3] </ref>. Oracle (a future VOD service provider) has set up a three-tiered video server. The dozen or so most popular releases will always be loaded into the first tier, the main memory of the computer.

Reference-contexts: Video objects are very large even in compressed form. One motion picture with NTSC quality video which is 100 minutes long, in uncompressed form occupies 40 GB (Giga Bytes) of storage and 1 GB when compressed according to MPEG standard <ref> [5] </ref>. These video objects have to be made available to the client in a continuous fashion in order to avoid "hiccups". A number of storage techniques assuring continuity of playback have been considered in [6] and [12].

Each object is allocated some bandwidth on a logical channel. This bandwidth is reserved for periodic broadcast of that object.
