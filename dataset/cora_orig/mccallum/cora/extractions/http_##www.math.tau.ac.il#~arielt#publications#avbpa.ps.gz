Title: Face Detection by Direct Convexity Estimation

Abstract: We suggest a novel attentional mechanism for detection of smooth convex and concave objects based on direct processing of intensity values. The operator detects the regions of the eyes and hair in a facial image, and thus allows us to infer the face location and scale. Our operator is robust to variations in illumination, scale, and face orientation. Invariance to a large family of functions, serving for lighting improvement in images, is proved. An extensive comparison with edge based methods is delineated.

The attentional mechanism is simply the derivative of the argument map with respect to the y-direction: @ @y (x; y) [G (x) D (y)] fl (x; y).

Reference-contexts: These variations lead to strong edges, which distract edge-based methods from the subject. Y-Phase does not react strongly to sharp changes, but rather, to gradual changes of intensity of the kind exhibited by the eyes and hair. (see also <ref> [3] </ref>). 3. Robustness to Lighting: In Fig. 5 (c), the background is better lit than the subject. Y-Phase detects the subject, while edge methods, the background. The improvement of the image by the logarithm (Fig. 5 (d)) makes edge based methods too detect the subject.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Edge detection was, so far, the core of most state of the art techniques for attentional mechanisms as well as face detection (see <ref> [4] </ref>, [6]). This excludes some recent works which utilize neural networks ([9],[7]), color histograms ([2],[8]), or shape statistics ([1],[5]) for face detection.
