Reference-contexts: Especially, the minimum remaining values heuristic, also called first fail principle, has been applied beneficially <ref> [1] </ref>. Two variants of this heuristic have been proposed to additionally exploit results from the propagation of constraint hierarchies [10]. 1 This paper will concentrate on prospective constraint processing.

Reference-contexts: Hence, both aspects need to be integrated in an understandable way in order to make problem representation as easy as possible. To achieve this goal, ideas of hierarchical constraint logic programming (HCLP) <ref> [2] </ref> have been translated into the context of constraint satisfaction avoiding some disadvantages of the HCLP scheme. The nurse scheduling problem is represented in the resulting scheme | as a hierarchical constraint satisfaction problem (HCSP). <p> Each constraint of a higher hierarchy level is more important than all constraints of lower levels together. Within each category constraints are rated according to a weight. These hierarchies of preference correspond to the hierarchy levels in hierarchical logic programming (HCLP) <ref> [2] </ref>. However, some disadvantages of this formal framework, mainly concerning the so called inter-hierarchy comparison, should be avoided. <p> The HCLP scheme <ref> [2] </ref> introduced lexical combinations of preference criteria. Several preference criteria are treated one by one in a certain order due to their importance. The most important criterion is considered first.

Reference-contexts: Usually, importance of constraints is stated by a real number representing either a weight [5] or a priority, a possibility value or a fuzzy membership value <ref> [3] </ref>. In systems of weighted constraints the problem solver tries to satisfy constraints with a maximal sum of weights. Thus, the simultaneous satisfaction of many less important constraints can be preferred to the satisfaction of a single but more important constraint. <p> Such attributes presuppose ". . . a commensurability between preference levels pertaining to different constraints. In other words the user who specifies the constraints must describe them by means of a unique preference scale" <ref> [3] </ref>. In the nurse scheduling Harald Meyer auf'm Hofe: ConPlan/SIEDAplan PACT-97 Contribution 2 problem one needs both methods of combining preference levels of different constraints: weights as a cumulative measure of importance as well as priorities. <p> Compulsory and optional demands on a schedule have been distinguished. Of course, the optional demands are of different importance. As mentioned above two basic ways have been suggested to represent such different degrees of preference: Weights [5] and priorities <ref> [3] </ref>. The satisfaction of a constraint with a large weight can be less preferred than the simultaneous satisfaction of many constraints with smaller weights, whereas a constraint of high priority is always more important than all constraints of lower priority together. <p> On the one hand, these procedures prune domains of unlabeled variables in advance. On the other hand, an optimistic estimation of the distance ffi is computed to reduce branching in row 4b of the algorithm. Additionally, arc-consistency with hard constraints [9] and prioritized constraints <ref> [16, 3] </ref> can be maintained after each assignment for the same purposes.

Reference-contexts: Typically, sound and complete techniques like arc-consistency processing, and numerous application specific heuristics are coupled to achieve an acceptable latency of the system on most problem instances. Latency possibly varies strongly between different instances of the problem because of tree search's exponential complexity. Lately, neighborhood interchangeability <ref> [4] </ref> of shifts has been used to simplify nurse scheduling problems [18]. The effect of this method is to unify shifts playing a similar role in the scheduling process during search | in this case several types of idle shifts.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the opportunity is needed to represent constraints of distinguished importance and to compute a solution complying with the set of most important constraints. Usually, importance of constraints is stated by a real number representing either a weight <ref> [5] </ref> or a priority, a possibility value or a fuzzy membership value [3]. In systems of weighted constraints the problem solver tries to satisfy constraints with a maximal sum of weights. <p> The nurse scheduling problem is represented in the resulting scheme | as a hierarchical constraint satisfaction problem (HCSP). Such problems of partial constraint satisfaction may be solved searching either exhaustively by enhanced versions of the branch&bound algorithm <ref> [5, 11, 10] </ref> or locally [17]. The effort of exhaustive search grows in worst cases exponentially with the number of the variables to be labeled with shifts, whereas local search is not sound. Common constraint logic programming approaches to nurse scheduling base on exhaustive search. <p> Compulsory and optional demands on a schedule have been distinguished. Of course, the optional demands are of different importance. As mentioned above two basic ways have been suggested to represent such different degrees of preference: Weights <ref> [5] </ref> and priorities [3]. The satisfaction of a constraint with a large weight can be less preferred than the simultaneous satisfaction of many constraints with smaller weights, whereas a constraint of high priority is always more important than all constraints of lower priority together. <p> Basically, these extensions concern three rows in figure 2: * In row 4a the term "inconsistent with" can have several concrete meanings. Naive implementations only check constraints between labeled variables. In contrast, forward checking with domains of yet unlabeled variables is possible either with hard and soft constraints <ref> [5] </ref>. On the one hand, these procedures prune domains of unlabeled variables in advance. On the other hand, an optimistic estimation of the distance ffi is computed to reduce branching in row 4b of the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Another user interface for labeling bad regions in the schedule before restarting local search is in preparation. However, these opportunities have hardly been needed, yet. 2 By the way, a similar procedure is well known in the context of resource oriented configuration systems <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An initial labeling is computed and improved continuously changing the labels of a relatively small set of variables V 0 ae V . This optimization in row 4 can either be limited to a local improvement of the labeling <ref> [12] </ref> or accept a worse labeling with a certain probability [15]. The first method is known to improve labelings rapidly but stick to local minima of the preference criterion. In contrast, the latter techniques converge on globally optimal solutions but are slower in improving a labeling [17].
