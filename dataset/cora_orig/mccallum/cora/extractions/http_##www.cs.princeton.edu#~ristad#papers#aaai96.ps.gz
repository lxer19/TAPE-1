Reference-contexts: Our interpretation gives rise to the second contribution of our work, namely, the use of nonuniform predictions. Nonuniform predictions is a principled way to perform alphabet extension, that is, to make a string become a symbol in the alphabet, an ad hoc technique that can improve model performance <ref> (Jeanrenaud et al. 1995) </ref>. This paper consists of three sections. First, we provide three different generative intepretations for the interpolation parameters of a Markov model. These interpretations give rise to a state model, a context model, and our nouniform model.

Reference-contexts: We believe that our work has two contributions to offer to the field of Markov modeling. The first contribution is our interpretation of the interpolation parameters of an interpolated Markov model <ref> (Jelinek & Mercer 1980) </ref> as beliefs about conditional independence. Prior work has interpreted the interpolation parameters as hidden state transitions between models of different orders, or as smoothing "specific probabilities" with "general probabilities". Our interpretation gives rise to the second contribution of our work, namely, the use of nonuniform predictions. <p> Context Model Alternately, the interpolation parameters may be understood as smoothing the conditional probabilities estimated from longer histories with those estimated from shorter histories <ref> (Jelinek & Mercer 1980) </ref>. Longer histories support stronger predictions, while shorter histories have more accurate statistics. Interpolating the predictions from histories of different lengths results in more accurate predictions than can be obtained from any fixed history length.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we prove that the nonuniform interpretation is fundamentally different from either uniform interpretation because it is not possible to map a nonuniform model into an extensionally equivalent uniform model. The full paper <ref> (Ristad & Thomas 1996) </ref> provides efficient algorithms for evaluating the proba bility of a string according to a nonuniform model, for finding the most likely nonuniform generation path for a given string, and for optimizing the parameters of a nonuniform model on a training corpus. Our notation is as follows.
