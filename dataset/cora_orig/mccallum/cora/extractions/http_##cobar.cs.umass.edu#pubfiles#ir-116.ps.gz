Abstract: This study investigates the ability of cluster visualization to help a user rapidly identify relevant documents. It provides added support for the truth of the Cluster Hypothesis on retrieved documents and shows that clustering of relevant documents is readily visible. The study then shows the visual effect of a technique similar to relevance feedback and shows how to enhance that effect to further help the user locate relevant material. A ranked list returned by a text search engine purports to present the documents in the order they are most likely to be relevant: the first document is the best match for the user's query, the second is the next most likely to be helpful, and so on. We are interested in situations where this simple model breaks down|where the user is unable to find enough relevant material in the first or second screens of the list. In particular, we are interested in helping a searcher find all of the relevant material in the top ranked list without forcing him or her to wade through all of the non-relevant material. Our approach is based on a combination of document clustering and visualization. We have observed that when documents are clustered and their relationships are visually displayed, the relevant documents generally clump together in the visualization. In this study, we investigate several hypotheses related to this observation:

Reference-contexts: The documents are usually presented as points or objects in space with their relative positions indicating how closely they are related. Links are often drawn between highly-related documents to make their relationships clearer. 2-D visualization Allan <ref> [1, 2] </ref> developed a visualization for showing the relationship between documents and parts of documents. It arrayed the documents around an oval and connected them when their similarity was strong enough.

Reference-contexts: The user still must select terms, but now they are placed on the surface of a sphere rather than the edge of a circle. The additional dimension should allow the user to see separation more readily. Our system is similar in approach to the Bead system <ref> [5] </ref> in that both use forms of spring embedding for placing high-dimensional objects in 3-space. The Bead research did not investigate the question of enhancing the separation of relevant and non-relevant documents. Figure 2 shows sample visuals of our system (they are explained in more detail in later sections).

Reference-contexts: It arrayed the documents around an oval and connected them when their similarity was strong enough. Allan's immediate goal was not to find the groups of relevant documents, but to find unusual patterns of relationships between documents. The Vibe system <ref> [8] </ref> is a 2-D display that shows how documents related to each other in terms of user-selected dimensions. The documents being browsed are placed in the center of a circle.

Reference-contexts: Two decades ago, Croft showed that the top-ranked documents usually contained a "best" cluster|one that had most of the relevant documents.[6] Hearst and Pedersen showed the same effect by using Scatter/Gather to cluster the top-ranked documents presented to searchers.<ref> [10] </ref> 2 clusters presented textually. Textual presentations The Scatter/Gather interface [10] presents the document clusters as text. It groups the documents into five clusters and displays them simultaneously as lists. On a large enough screen, the top several documents from each cluster are clearly visible.

Reference-contexts: The user can shift the location of terms and adjust their weights to better understand the relationships between the documents. 3-D visualization High-powered graphics workstations and the visual appeal of 3-dimensional graphics have encouraged efforts to present document relationships in 3-space. The LyberWorld system <ref> [11] </ref> includes an implementation of the Vibe system described above, but presented in 3-space. The user still must select terms, but now they are placed on the surface of a sphere rather than the edge of a circle. The additional dimension should allow the user to see separation more readily.

Reference-contexts: The proposal and investigation of hypothesis 3 is the main contribution of the work. Document clustering and visualization The Cluster Hypothesis of Information Retrieval states that "closely associated documents tend to be relevant to the same requests". <ref> [15, p.45] </ref> The implication of the hypothesis' truth is that if one document is relevant to a query, then it is reasonable to include documents that are highly similar to that one: they, too, are likely to be relevant.
