Abstract: We consider a class of infinite two-player games played on finitely coloured graphs. Our main question is: what is the exact size of memory needed by the players for their winning strategies. This problem is relevant to synthesis of reactive programs and to the theory of automata on infinite objects. Following ideas of Zielonka we provide matching upper and lower bounds for the size of memory needed by winning strategies in games with a fixed winning condition. We also show that in general the Latest Appearance Record data structure of Gurevich and Harrington is optimal.

Reference-contexts: A winning condition F is a Rabin condition if it does not have splits. It is a Street condition if P (C) n F does not have splits. And finally F is a Mostowski condition (or a parity condition <ref> [EJ91] </ref>) if it is both a Rabin and a Street condition. Remark: In literature the notions of Rabin, Street and Mostowski conditions are usually defined in a different manner (see, e.g., the survey papers of Thomas [Tho90] and Niwinski [Niw97]). <p> They show that the Latest Appearance Record (LAR in short) data structure is sufficient as the memory for winning strategies in Muller games. Thomas [Tho95] uses the LAR's and the Memoryless Determinacy Theorem for Mostowski games (due to Mostowski [Mos91] and Emerson and Jutla <ref> [EJ91] </ref>) to provide a reduction from Muller games to Mostowski games. This reduction gives both the Forgetful Determinacy Theorem for Muller games and an upper bound on the size of memory for winning strategies. The argument is, however, insensitive to the actual winning condition. <p> The next Corollary gives our first upper bound on the size of memory sufficient for winning strategies in Muller games. Here we use the Memoryless Deter-minacy Theorem for Mostowski games due to Mostowski [Mos91] and Emerson and Jutla <ref> [EJ91] </ref>. Note that the Memoryless Determinacy Theorem, as well as Corollary 7 are special cases of Theorem 12 of the next section. Corollary 7 Let G = (A; F) be a Muller game with the winning condition F.

Reference-contexts: Whereas in Mostowski games both players have memoryless winning strategies, in Muller games in general there is an asymmetry between the players. For example if a winning condition of a player can be represented in Rabin form then by the results of Emerson <ref> [Eme85] </ref>, Klarlund [Kla92] and McNaughton [McN93] the player has a memoryless winning strategy. The opponent of a player with a Rabin winning condition has a Street winning condition. <p> Memoryless determinacy for such games was shown in <ref> [Eme85, Kla92] </ref>. Remark: Observe that every 1-subtree of a tree from the Example on page 4 (Figure 1) has n leaves (labelled with H i1 ; : : : ; H in for some i).

Reference-contexts: All the games we consider are determined [Mar75]. This means that from every vertex of the arena one of the players has a winning strategy. In other words, the winning sets for both players form a partition of the set of vertices. It turns out (see <ref> [GH82, McN93] </ref>) that for the games with Muller winning conditions the winning strategies can be realised by functions that do not have to refer to the whole current position of the game (recall that the set of positions is infinite), but only to a bounded amount of information about it. <p> 4 is a winning strategy from some vertex v 0 , then for every m 2 M the strategy given by m and (i M ; i V ) is a winning strategy from v 0 as well. 3 A generalization of LAR's Gurevich and Harrington in their seminal paper <ref> [GH82] </ref> prove the Forgetful Determinacy Theorem for games with Muller winning conditions. They show that the Latest Appearance Record (LAR in short) data structure is sufficient as the memory for winning strategies in Muller games. <p> In this section we address this asymmetry between the players. We reprove the Forgetful Determinacy Theorem of Gurevich and Harrington <ref> [GH82] </ref>, while improving the upper bound on the size of memory obtained in Corollary 7. The improvement is due to a finer analysis of what data a player needs to keep track of in order to successfully play against the opponent.

Reference-contexts: We say that a strategy is winning for player 0 from a set W , if it is winning for player 0 from every vertex w 2 W . Strategies and the winning set for player 1 are defined similarly. All the games we consider are determined <ref> [Mar75] </ref>. This means that from every vertex of the arena one of the players has a winning strategy. In other words, the winning sets for both players form a partition of the set of vertices.

Reference-contexts: We assume that every vertex has at least one successor. Hence every finite path in the arena can be prolonged. A (Muller ) game is a pair G = (A; F), where A is an arena and F P (C) is a winning condition (in Muller form <ref> [Tho90] </ref>). A position in the game is a finite path in A. Note that even if the arena is finite (i.e., the arena has a finite number of vertices), the set of positions in the game is infinite, because in every arena there are finite paths of arbitrary length. <p> And finally F is a Mostowski condition (or a parity condition [EJ91]) if it is both a Rabin and a Street condition.

Reference-contexts: Remark: In literature the notions of Rabin, Street and Mostowski conditions are usually defined in a different manner (see, e.g., the survey papers of Thomas [Tho90] and Niwinski [Niw97]). It can be, however, shown (see the paper of Zielonka <ref> [Zie94] </ref> for details) that our formulation is equivalent September 26, 1998 - 13 : 14 DRAFT 3 to the standard one. More precisely, a winning condition is a Rabin (Street, Mostowski) condition in our sense iff it can be represented in Rabin (Street, Mostowski) form in the usual sense. <p> We design a generalisation of the LAR data structure and use it to provide a more succinct reduction of Muller games to Mostowski games. Following the ideas implicit in Zielonka's proof of the Forgetful Determinacy Theorem <ref> [Zie94] </ref> we introduce the notion of a Zielonka tree of a winning condition. The gener-alised LAR's for games with a winning condition F are just the leaves of the Zielonka tree of F. Notation: Let F P (C) be a winning condition. <p> The crucial point is to treat the two players in a different manner, which gives way to considerable optimisations of the size of memory for winning strategies. Our upper bound is very much inspired by the work of Zielonka <ref> [Zie94] </ref>; in fact the proof of the Forgetful Determinacy Theorem we present here closely follows his. His elegant construction implicitly captures the asymmetry between the players we have mentioned above. <p> : : ; Y +k1 may be not disjoint and in our strategy we needed to know on which Y j we are playing. fl fl Remark: Note that, in particular, if P (C) n F is closed under union, i.e., F can be expressed by a Rabin condition (see <ref> [Zie94] </ref>), then the strategy i G is memoryless. Memoryless determinacy for such games was shown in [Eme85, Kla92].
