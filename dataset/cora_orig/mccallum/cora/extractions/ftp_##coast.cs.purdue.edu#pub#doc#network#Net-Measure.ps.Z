Title: A Best-Case Network Performance Model  
Author: Steven M. Bellovin 
Date: February 12, 1992  
Abstract: Network performance measures usually focus on average throughput. We, however, were concerned with best-case behavior: how fast could a packet traverse the network if there were no contention for resources. By subtracting the path time to a node from the path time through the node, we were able to develop a simple best-case delay model. This model was sensitive enough to determine the board-level configuration of a router 750 miles away.

Reference-contexts: The time to initialize the packet data areas do not count; the timestamps are computed just before it is sent, and just after it is received. The observations are shown in Figure 2. We used the S Data Analysis System <ref> [BCW88] </ref> to compute a least squares fit to the data; this is shown on the graph as a straight line. As can be seen, the fit is fairly good, confirming our analysis.

Reference-contexts: Why is this useful, since we cannot use these mechanisms to detect passive eavesdroppers? There are a number of cryptographic protocols that can be applied if one can assume that no active wiretapping takes place. For example, the Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange protocol <ref> [DH76] </ref> provides excellent security against a listener, but is useless against an opponent who sits in the middle. We can employ this protocol if we can verify that no active wiretaps exist. 8 6 Conclusions Our model's accuracy is limited by several factors.

Reference-contexts: If the packet size is large with respect to the line speed, this becomes a critical factor. Using more packets of a smaller size can be a significant help, because transmission times can then be overlapped. This suggests that the Internet's path MTU discovery algorithm <ref> [MD90] </ref> may not be an unmixed blessing. Two solutions suggest themselves: increasing the line speed or decreasing the number of hops. The latter may be achievable by using more large-scale communication subnets, after the style of the old ARPANET, rather than dedicated point-to-point links.

Reference-contexts: This assumption may not be true in some cases.) For our measurements, we used the TCP/IP protocol suite. Specifically, 2 we used the the ICMP <ref> [Pos81] </ref> echo and echo-reply messages.
