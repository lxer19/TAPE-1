Abstract: The schema theorem states that implicit parallel search is behind the power of the genetic algorithm. We contend that chromosomes can vote, proportionate to their fitness, for candidate schemata. We maintain a population of binary strings and ternary schemata. The string population not only works on solving its problem domain, but it supplies fitness for the schema population, which indirectly can solve the original problem.

Reference-contexts: Brams and Fishburn claim that the Borda count is vulnerable to strategic manipulation <ref> [ Brams and Fishburn, 1991 ] </ref> . Again, due to the cooperative nature of our population of chromosomes, we do not have to worry about the sincerity of our voters. The candidate population of schemata is evaluated by the votes of the voting population of strings.

Reference-contexts: Each chromosome in the population can be searching different parts of the search space or fitness landscape. Each chromosome can be considered as a behavioral strategy for controlling an agent [ Haynes et al., 1995 ] , indeed Cobb views each chromosome as an agent <ref> [ Cobb, 1993 ] </ref> . The agents, i.e. chromosomes, are considered to be autonomous in the sense that they do not typically interact to find a solution. <p> Genetic algorithms are often interpreted as competitive learning systems, the driving force for exploring the fitness landscape is "survival of the fittest." GAs can also be considered as cooperative learning systems <ref> [ Cobb, 1993 ] </ref> , GBML systems certainly fall into this category. <p> Cobb views the fitness function as a mechanism to determine which solutions are to be shared among the agents, with the crossover operator (a biologically inspired operator which exchanges genetic material between two parents as they produce two children) as the vehicle for which "partial solutions" are shared between agents <ref> [ Cobb, 1993 ] </ref> . We adopt the view that chromosomes are agents.

Reference-contexts: In the "Michigan approach" each chromosome is a rule and the population as a whole is the ruleset. In the "Pitt approach" each chromosome is a ruleset, being comprised of multiple rules <ref> [ DeJong, 1990 ] </ref> . Genetic algorithms are often interpreted as competitive learning systems, the driving force for exploring the fitness landscape is "survival of the fittest." GAs can also be considered as cooperative learning systems [ Cobb, 1993 ] , GBML systems certainly fall into this category.

Reference-contexts: Since we are interested in cooperation, we force our voters to be honest and thus we do not have to account for strategic manipulation.

Reference-contexts: Building blocks have a small defining length and are highly fit. They are integral to the schema theorem, which defines how the implicit parallel search of a GA "builds" better solutions over time <ref> [ Goldberg, 1989 ] </ref> . In the GA, schemata fight for representation in the population of strings. Schemata which have a high representation in the more fit members of the population in generation G i , are more likely to be represented in the next generation G i+1 .

Reference-contexts: Our preliminary experimentation does not bear this out. Haynes showed that such cooperation was feasible in a genetic programming (GP) population. The cooperation allowed the scaling of the complexity in the problem domain <ref> [ Haynes, 1997 ] </ref> . Further experiments with either "real" domains or harder Royal Road functions is warranted. 6 Conclusions We have presented a voting scheme which allows a population of binary strings to arrive at a consensus choice for desirable schemata while balancing different preferences for schema.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Genetic algorithms (GA) <ref> [ Holland, 1975 ] </ref> are a class of distributed search algorithms inspired by biological evolutionary adaptation. The GA represents search strategies in a population of chromosomes. Each chromosome in the population can be searching different parts of the search space or fitness landscape.

Reference-contexts: This ordering sets up the Borda Count algorithm. 4 Experiments 4.1 Royal Road Function Royal Road functions represent fitness landscapes which facilitate the testing and understanding of how the GA works <ref> [ Mitchell et al., 1992 ] </ref> . By explicitly designing the fitness function to encourage building blocks, the performance of the GA can be tested. Consider the 1s problem, i.e. with a fixed binary string, the global optimum is having a 1 in each bit. <p> In Figure 2, the goal is detect the 8 schemata and use them to build the solution up. By selecting these building blocks, they are providing a detailed algorithm for solving the 1s problem. Their choice of building blocks dictates the learning curve for this problem <ref> [ Mitchell et al., 1992 ] </ref> . We apply our voting GA to the task of solving the 1s problem via the R 1 schemata. We have modified a simple GA to maintain a separate population of schemata.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, these qualities would allow their children to interact better with the environment than they were able to interact. As a whole, society can adopt such a view, but individuals might have differences of opinion as to what are the desirable traits. A common consensus reaching mechanism is voting <ref> [ Ordeshook, 1995 ] </ref> ; the desires of the majority are undertaken. In this paper, we apply techniques from voting theory to select such traits in 1 a GA population. The canonical GA chromosome, or string, representation utilizes a binary alphabet. <p> One problem is that different individuals have different desires, which may be conflicting. The various voting strategies can all be sabotaged by strategic manipulation <ref> [ Ordeshook, 1995, Straffin, Jr., 1980 ] </ref> , i.e. voting insincerely to get a favorable alternative to win. Since we are interested in cooperation, we force our voters to be honest and thus we do not have to account for strategic manipulation.
