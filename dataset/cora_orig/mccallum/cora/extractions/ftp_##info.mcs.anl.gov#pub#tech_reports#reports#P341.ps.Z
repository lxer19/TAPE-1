Title: The Canonical Forms of a Lattice Rule  
Author: J. N. Lyness 
Abstract: Much of the elementary theory of lattice rules may be presented as an elegant application of classical results. These include Kronecker group representation theorem and the Hermite and Smith normal forms of integer matrices. The theory of the canonical form is a case in point. In this paper, some of this theory is treated in a constructive rather than abstract manner. A step-by-step approach that parallels the group theory is described, leading to an algorithm to obtain a canonical form of a rule of prime power order. The number of possible distinct canonical forms is derived, and this is used to determine the number of integration lattices having specified invariants.
