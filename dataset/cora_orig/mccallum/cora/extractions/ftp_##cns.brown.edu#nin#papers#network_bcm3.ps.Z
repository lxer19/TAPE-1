Abstract: A two-eye visual environment is used in training a network of BCM neurons. We study the effect of misalignment between the synaptic density functions from the two eyes, on the formation of orientation selectivity and ocular dominance in a lateral inhibition network. The visual environment we use is composed of natural images. We show that for the BCM rule a natural image environment with binocular cortical misalignment is sufficient for producing networks with orientation selective cells and ocular dominance columns. This work is an extension of our previous single cell misalignment model (Shouval et al., 1996).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is generally accepted that both orientation selectivity and ocular dominance of receptive fields in the visual cortex of cats are dramatically influenced by the visual environment <ref> (for a comprehensive review see, Fregnac and Imbert, 1984) </ref>. Organization of the different properties of receptive fields such as ocular dominance and orientation selectivity across the visual cortex is best observed by optical imaging techniques (Bonhoeffer and Grinvald, 1991; Blasdel, 1992).

Reference-contexts: For example, Li and Atick (1994) have used natural images to extract detailed two-eye power spectra from stereo images and used these results to predict properties of cortical receptive fields. We have recently shown <ref> (Shouval et al., 1996) </ref> that single cell BCM neurons, trained in a binocular natural image environment can develop both orientation selectivity and varying degrees of ocular dominance. We have also shown in that study that PCA (Oja, 1982) neurons can not develop ocular dominance. <p> replaced by the spatial average (under stationarity assumption) and is thus given by fi M (x) = E [c 2 (x)]; (2) where E denotes the expectation over the visual environment. 1 This result can be shown to follow from an extension of the two-eye parity method to linear networks <ref> (Shouval et al., 1996) </ref>. is denoted by a and the shift between the receptive fields (of both eyes) is denoted by s. In the lateral inhibition network c depends on the inputs, the synaptic weights and also on the activity of it's neighbors. <p> In this work we have used a simplified version of the full gradient in which the lateral inhibition affects only the cell activity. Thus the network dynamics is given by Equations 1,2,3. We have used the visual environment described in detail in our single cell study <ref> (Shouval et al., 1996) </ref>. It is composed of a set of 24 natural images scanned at a 256 X 256 pixel resolution. We have avoided man-made objects, because they have many sharp edges, and straight lines, which make it easier to achieve oriented receptive fields. <p> As illustrated in Figure 1, the input vectors from both eyes are chosen as small, partially overlapping, circular regions of the preprocessed natural images; these converge on the same cortical cell. 3 Results and discussion We have extended our single cell results <ref> (Shouval et al., 1996) </ref> to networks of inter-connected neurons. The networks have been trained with a natural scene environment that was preprocessed with a DOG filter. The two eyes were exposed to small partially overlapping portions of these images. Figure 2 depicts results of a typical network.
