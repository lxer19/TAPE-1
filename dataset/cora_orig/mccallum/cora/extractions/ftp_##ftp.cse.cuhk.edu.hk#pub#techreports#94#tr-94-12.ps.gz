Reference-contexts: I-frames are coded independent of any other frames. On the other hand, B-frames are coded by interpolating between previous and a future I or P-frame. Therefore, the I-frames might have size which is 100 to 200 times the size of the B-frame [11]. Most recent research works <ref> [16, 14, 1, 8, 3, 15, 13] </ref> concentrated on the study of multimedia storage systems which support the retrieval of a multimedia object at a peak display bandwidth (bits/sec), for example, assuming that the display bandwidth of object is fixed at B display Mbps throughout the duration of the display, then

Reference-contexts: Usually video object, by itself, has large storage and high bandwidth requirement. For example, a 100 minutes HDTV video object requires an average of 800 megabits per second (Mbps) bandwidth and around 60 Gbytes of storage <ref> [3] </ref>. Typically, compression (e.g, MPEG) is used to reduce the storage as well as the network bandwidth requirement so that video object can be delivered to end users. However, it is important to observe that the frame size (bits) varies significantly from frame to frame. <p> I-frames are coded independent of any other frames. On the other hand, B-frames are coded by interpolating between previous and a future I or P-frame. Therefore, the I-frames might have size which is 100 to 200 times the size of the B-frame [11]. Most recent research works <ref> [16, 14, 1, 8, 3, 15, 13] </ref> concentrated on the study of multimedia storage systems which support the retrieval of a multimedia object at a peak display bandwidth (bits/sec), for example, assuming that the display bandwidth of object is fixed at B display Mbps throughout the duration of the display, then <p> approach is that the display quality is very good but the decompression and compression operations are computationally intensive, special hardwares are needed for the implementation. 3 For example, the bandwidth requirement of MPEG-I is 1.5 Mbits/second. 13 5 Related Work 5.1 Comparison of Round-robin Striping and Staggered Strip ing In <ref> [3] </ref>, staggered stripping was proposed for file layout architecture to support video on demand. We choose staggered striping for comparison because it uses the similar concept of file declustering, that is, splitting up a video file and laying the file across the parallel disk array.

Reference-contexts: However, if there are many different video objects are played back at the same time, the approach will suffer from a severe performance degradation because only a small block of data is retrieved for a phase of playback from the disk for each disk movement. In <ref> [13, 4] </ref>, several ways to support interactive playback function are proposed, such as fast forward and backward functions by skipping fragments. 6 Performance Evaluation 6.1 Playback at Normal Speed In this subsection, we evaluate the performance of round-robin striping and staggered striping by computer simulation for four different cases: Case 1)

Reference-contexts: For example, the MPEG-III for supporting HDTV has display bandwidth that can range from 5 to 20 Mbps <ref> [6] </ref>. Again, storage I/O bandwidth is not efficiently utilized if the peak bandwidth allocation policy is used. * Using the worst case display bandwidth allocation as the disk I/O retrieval rate, it is possible to have buffer overflow problem.

Reference-contexts: We also illustrate 1) video files layout policy, 2) parallel disk scheduling policy for incoming request, 3) admission control policy and, 4) how to support VCR typed function such as fast forward with viewing. It is interesting to point out that in <ref> [7] </ref>, authors described different ways of reducing I/O demand for the VOD storage server. <p> It is important to point out that the VOD storage server we describe in this paper can support this interesting I/O reduction techniques with zero storage overhead. For more information about dynamic merging techniques, please refer to <ref> [7] </ref>. The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the architecture of VOD storage server and video file layout policy. In Section 3, we describe a request scheduling algorithm that optimizes disk utilization and buffer space. <p> Performance studies have been carried out and we have shown that it can have good request response and system throughput. Also, the type of VOD can support the dynamic merging techniques as described in <ref> [7] </ref> to reduce the I/O cost with zero storage overhead. 22

Reference-contexts: Efficient tape scheduling algorithms for VOD storage system have been studied in <ref> [9] </ref>. Upon retrieval from the disk storage system, video frames are put into buffer so that they can be packetized and be delivered through the network (either in form of LAN or WAN) to different display stations.

Reference-contexts: To schedule tasks within a disk, the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm is used. We choose the EDF algorithm because the EDF algorithm is found to be optimal for scheduling tasks in a single disk <ref> [12] </ref>. Temporal relation for related tasks (belong to the same request) that were assigned to different disks are maintained by the algorithm (via each fragment deadline). The system maintains a doubly linked-list which contains all tasks there are 6 scheduled for the particular disk.
