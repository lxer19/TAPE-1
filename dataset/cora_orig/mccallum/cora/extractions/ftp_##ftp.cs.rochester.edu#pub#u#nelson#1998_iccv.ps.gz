Abstract: We describe an appearance-based object recognition system using a keyed, multi-level context representation reminiscent of certain aspects of cubist art. Specifically, we utilize distinctive intermediate-level features in this case automatically extracted 2-D boundary fragments,, as keys, which are then verified within a local context, and assembled within a loose global context to evoke an overall percept. This system demonstrates good recognition of a variety of 3-D shapes, ranging from sports cars and fighter planes to snakes and lizards with full orthographic invari-ance. We report the results of large-scale tests, involving over 2000 separate test images, that evaluate performance with increasing number of items in the database, in the presence of clutter, background change, and occlusion, and also the results of some generic classification experiments where the system is tested on objects never previously seen or modeled. To our knowledge, the results we report are the best in the literature for full-sphere tests of general shapes with occlusion and clutter resistance.

Murase and Nayar [8] find the major principal components of an image dataset, and use the projections of unknown images onto these as indices into a recognition memory.

Both groups present large scale tests on databases of real images. Nayar presents results using eigenspace techniques for 3-D recogni-tion in databases containing several tens of objects with accuracy comparable to what we report.

Reference-contexts: The system needs a characteristic shape or pattern to index on, and does not work well for objects whose character is statistical, such as generic trees or pine cones. Component boundaries were extracted by modifying a stick-growing method for finding segments developed recently at Rochester <ref> [9] </ref> so that it could follow curved boundaries. The system is trained using images taken approximately every 20 degrees around the sphere, amounting to about 100 views for a full sphere, and 50 for a hemisphere. system on an image of a cup from the test set.
