Reference-contexts: take advantage of IBM's ESSL (when available) is being developed; the object-oriented nature of PETSc means that users can take advantage of these changes by relinking rather than rewriting their code. 2.6 Porting the p4 Parallel Programming System to the SP-1 Contributed by Ewing Lusk The p4 parallel programming system <ref> [2, 1] </ref> currently runs on nearly all existing parallel computers and workstations. It has been used routinely on networks of RS/6000's. It was hoped that the RS/6000 version of p4 could be built unchanged on the SP-1.

Reference-contexts: This instance of the implementation builds on Chameleon, using the p4 transport layer. We expect it to be easy to port MPI directly on top of EUI-1 or lower level communication primitives. 6 2.4 PCN Contributed by Steven Tuecke The RS/6000 network version of PCN (net-PCN) <ref> [3, 4] </ref> worked on the SP-1 with no modifications. This version of PCN uses TCP/IP (i.e., sockets) for communication between nodes and uses rsh for node startup.

Reference-contexts: The packages include a numerical library (BlockSolve) and three programming packages (Chameleon, PCN, and p4). In addition, a port of part of the draft message-passing standard (MPI) has been made to the SP-1. 2.1 BlockSolve Contributed by Paul Plassmann and Lori Freitag BlockSolve <ref> [5] </ref> is a software library for solving large, sparse systems of linear equations on massively parallel computers.
