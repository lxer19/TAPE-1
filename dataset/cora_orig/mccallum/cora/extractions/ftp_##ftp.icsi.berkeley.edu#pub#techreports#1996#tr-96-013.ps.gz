Abstract: This report describes how we used ICSI's Hidden Markov Model (HMM) / Artificial Neural Network (ANN) speech recognition system to evaluate the Voice Mail (VM) digits corpus. We will present the new database, discuss the structure of the HMM/ANN recognizer, and finally report on the recognition performance we achieved in this initial work.

Reference-contexts: In this work 8 PLP and 8 delta PLP coefficients as well as delta energy are computed for the feature vector of each frame. To cope with "convolutional noise" at the front end, i.e. linear distortion to the communication channel for the speech input, we use RASTA (see <ref> [3] </ref>) to filter this noise in the logarithmic power spectrum domain.

Reference-contexts: A visual analysis (using command line C.4 of the appendix) of the resulting front-end output revealed severely "smeared" spectra. After generating improved mapping coefficients with the command C.2 we achieved the anticipated performance. For detailed information on spectral mapping in the scope of JRASTA, see <ref> [5] </ref>. 3.2 The ANN A Multiple Layer Perceptron The Artificial Neural Network we use for computing the posteriori probability for the phones (given a sequence of acoustic features) is a multiple layer perceptron (MLP), shown in fig. 5.

Reference-contexts: Along with these tasks evolved the structure of ICSI's hybrid speech recognition system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In recent work <ref> [6] </ref> this framework was applied to databases with small vocabularies like the Bellcore Isolated Digits (13 words), the TI Connected Digits (11 words), and Numbers'93 (95) (36 resp. 100 words). <p> Common sources of noise are low quality communication channels and occasional bursts, probably due to overmodulation of the microphone. This database has been evaluated on ICSI's speech recognition system in the scope of earlier work. In the experiments reported in <ref> [6] </ref> this data was split into four jackknife-cuts that were used for training and testing the HMM/ANN speech recognition system. In those experiments starting or ending silence surounding every utterance were excised by hand before the data was fed into the recognition system. <p> 3 layers: 153 inputs, 200 completely connected hidden units, 61 outputs Phoneset: Timit61 Lexicon: Single Pronunciation HMM Lexicon with garbage word Grammar: Wordpair Grammar with optional starting/ending garbage state Bootnet: Random initialization or a net bootstrapped from the handlabeled NTIMIT database applying RASTA/JRASTA Bootlexicon: Hand-tuned lexicons taken from earlier experiments <ref> [6] </ref> Number of Iterations: 7 The experimental results are reported in table 1 . We varied the front-end processing as well as the bootnet to learn about the performance behavior. For each experiment we state the iteration with the lowest error rate. <p> We have presented the garbage model as an effective means to handle real-life-noise in the digits database. Comparing the performance of our speech recognition system on this task (2.1% word error rate) with the results reported in <ref> [6] </ref> for the experiments on the jackknife-cuts of the Bellcore Digits (1.2% word error rate) it is found, that the use of two distinct databases for training and testing is a more difficult task for the speech recognizer.
