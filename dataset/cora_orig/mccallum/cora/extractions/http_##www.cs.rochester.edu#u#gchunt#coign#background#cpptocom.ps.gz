Abstract: The Microsoftfi Component Object Model (COM) borrows a key part of its architecture from standard implementations of C++. This article uses an existing project written in C++ and turns it into a component-based design that runs the object in a separate process, leveraging the COM infrastructure provided natively on all newer Microsoft operating systems. The focus is on explaining and deducing why and how features are implemented in COM, providing a robust, portable, and transparent model for distributed component software.
