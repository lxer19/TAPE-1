Abstract: We address the problem of guiding a robot in such a way, that it can decide, based on perceived sensor data, which future actions to choose, in order to reach a goal. In order to realize this guidance, the robot has access to a (probabilistic) automaton (PA), whose final states represent concepts, which have to be recognized in order to verify, that a goal has been achieved. The contribution of this work is to learn these PA's from classified sensor data of robot traces through known environments. Within this framework, we account for the uncertainties arising from ambiguous perceptions. We introduce a knowledge structure, called prefix tree, in which the sample data, represented as cases, is organized. The prefix tree is used to derive and estimate the parameters of deterministic, as well as probabilistic automata models, which reflect the inherent knowledge, implicit in the data, and which are used for recognition in a restricted first-order logic framework.

Reference-contexts: So the algorithm can be sketched as follows: Input: An observation sequence bf 1 : : : bf k . Output: The concepts, instances of which have been recognized during subintervals of the time interval <ref> [1; k] </ref>. <p> Then, the probabilities of the transitions have to be estimated. We have organized the training data in a prefix tree, which was used to solve both tasks. In principal, the first objective can also be achieved, by applying the L fl -algorithm, developed by Angluin <ref> [1] </ref>. The algorithm learns a regular set from a minimal adequate teacher , who is assumed to answer correctly membership queries and conjectures of the learner about the unknown regular set.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm learns a regular set from a minimal adequate teacher , who is assumed to answer correctly membership queries and conjectures of the learner about the unknown regular set. There have been numerous approaches for infering automata, especially with applications to robotics, e.g. [12],[14],[16], and <ref> [5] </ref>, which are based on L fl . Modifications of the algorithm seem to be possible, in order to apply it to our domain. Nevertheless, in our case, the construction of the prefix tree is a more straightforward way of attaining the automaton structure for a more complex representation.

We have shown, that it is possible to match sequences of observations onto input sequences of automata, whose final states indicate, that a concept, i.e., a sensor feature, has been recognized.

Reference-contexts: The contribution of this work is to learn this automaton from classified sensor data of robot traces through known environments. In <ref> [10] </ref> and [11], operational concepts have been introduced, which are used by a human user to guide a robot. They constitute the basis for high-level planning, but are also symbolically grounded in robot perceptions. <p> They constitute the basis for high-level planning, but are also symbolically grounded in robot perceptions. Rules have been learned, which derive these abstract concepts in several steps from sensor data and robot actions. The work presented in this paper complements the learning approach taken in <ref> [10] </ref>, [11] in the following way: The learned rules, which are represented in a restricted first-order logic framework, do not take into account the uncertainties, which are associated with sensor observations: rules were learned, which derive different concepts from the same sensor data. <p> Section 5 addresses the ambiguities, i.e., PA's. In Section 6, we present first results of experiments in the robotics domain. Section 7 deals with prediction and focus of attention. We conclude in Section 8 with a discussion of related and future work. 2 The Approach In <ref> [10] </ref>, operational concepts were developed, which are used by a robot to perform a user-defined task in a flexible way. On one hand, operational concepts provide the basis for high-level planning. <p> The investigation of this will be future work. The point, we would like to emphasize here, is that the inference of automata is a contribution to the idea to learn abstract operational concepts, such as move through door, turn left, and stop in front of the cupboard ( see <ref> [10] </ref>), which will be used flexibly, also in unknown environments. So our focus is put on closing the gap between the numerical representation of sensor data and the logic-based description of abstract concepts, which can be understood and used by a human user, in order to guide the robot.

Therefore, these learning algorithms cannot be applied directly to the domain used in <ref> [11] </ref>, which is represented within a restricted first-order logic. The existing algorithms learn the structure of the au-tomaton and estimate the probabilities of transitions, respectively. <p> Correspondingly, the sensors on the robot's left side will perceive wall 3 and 5. In <ref> [11] </ref>, we introduced the term jump for these kind of edge groupings, consisting of two parallel edges. An example of a rule 1 , which has been learned by ILP-algorithms is the following: through_door (Trace,Start,End,parallel) &lt;- sg_jump (Trace,left,T1,T2,parallel) & sg_jump (Trace,right,T1,T2,parallel) & Start &lt; T1 & T2 &lt; End. <p> Other important related work stems from the field of machine learning and ILP. By constructing the prefix tree, we have extracted the knowledge structure, which is implicit in the sample data, and, ultimately, in the flat rule set, learned in <ref> [11] </ref>. When generating the knowledge structure, we use the temporal relation between events. However, the resulting hierarchy can also be interpreted as concept hierarchy with a generalization hierarchy. The internal nodes of the tree represent potentially useful concepts, which could be introduced, in order to support recognition and classification.

Reference-contexts: How do different ways of calculating basic fea tures effect the structure and the ambigui ties? The calculation of basic features can be guided by different parameters. One parameter is the tolerance, within which successive measurements and their gradients, respectively, are considered to be approximately equal (for details see <ref> [17] </ref>). This tolerance has been set to 6 (Version 1), 10 (Version 2), and 15 degree (Version 3), respectively. The effect of the different versions is illustrated with the sequence of measurements in Figure 8.
