Abstract: This paper deals with a notion of "input to output stability" (ios), which formalizes the idea that outputs depend in an "aymptotically stable" manner on inputs, while internal signals remain bounded. When the output equals the complete state, one recovers the property of input to state stability (iss). When there are no inputs, one has a generalization of the classical concept of partial stability. The main results provide Lyapunov-function characterizations of ios.

Reference-contexts: holds. 2 Remark 2.2 The term ubibs is sometimes employed for a weaker property, in which an additive constant is allowed in the right-hand side of the estimate (2), that is, one does not ask that trajectories must remain small if initial states and controls are small; see for instance <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> To each given system (1) and each smooth function , we associate the following system with inputs d (): _x = g (x; d) := f (x; d (jyj)) ; y = h (x) ; (9) where d 2 M with = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> m . We will be using x (; ~; d) (and y (; ~; d), respectively) to denote the trajectory (and the output function respectively) of (9) corresponding to each initial state ~, each function , and each input d (). <p> Let, for each r &gt; 0, ' r : R n ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> be such that ' r (~) = 1; if ^! r (~) 2fl (r); 3fl (r) and let : R n ! R o be a smooth function such that (jh (~)j) (~) ^c 1 jh (~)j =3 for some K 1 -function . <p> With = 1 , one can rewrite (12) as DV (~)f (~; (jh (~)j)) ff 3 (V (~); j~j) for all ~ 2 R n , all jj 1. This implies that for any ~ and any d 2 M with = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> m , the corresponding trajectory x (t) := x (t; ~; d) of system (9) satisfies the following: d V (x (t)) ff 3 (V (x (t)); jx (t)j); 8 t 0: It follows immediately that V (x (t)) V (~) for all t 0, which, in turn, implies

Of course, in general, if there is a V that works for all r, then the system is ios.
