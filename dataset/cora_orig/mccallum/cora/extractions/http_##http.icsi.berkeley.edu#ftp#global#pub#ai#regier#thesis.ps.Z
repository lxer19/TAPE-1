This might be used in place of the mechanism used here.

Reference-contexts: Many connectionist learning systems are structured to one degree or another. Examples of connectionist systems which incorporate knowledge of the target domain into their architectures are the hand-written digit recognizers of [LeCun, 1989; Keeler et al., 1991], the equilateral triangle recognizer of <ref> [Ahmad and Omohundro, 1990] </ref>, the parser of [Jain et al., 1992], the object segmentation and recognition systems of [Mozer et al., 1991; Hummel and Biederman, 1990; Poggio and Edelman, 1990], and the perceptually-grounded 3 By the term "network", LeCun means an architecture with a specific set of weights on its links.

Reference-contexts: The systems of [Sopena, 1988], <ref> [Allen, 1990] </ref>, and [Bartell and Cottrell, 1991] represent efforts in this direction, accepting much simplified perceptual input, and learning to associate it with natural language descriptions of that input.

Reference-contexts: This process of coercion corresponds to part of Herskovits' proposed theory of the interpretation of locative expressions. As we shall see below, others have also picked up on this notion, including myself. <ref> [Andre et al., 1986; Schirra et al., 1987] </ref> present the Citytour system, produced by the Vitra project at the University of the Saarland in Germany. This system outputs German descriptions of the motions and positions of such objects as cars, churches, and post offices relative to one another. <p> In both cases the system handles moving trajectors, and is able to recognize situations and events corresponding to a number of German prepositions and verbs. <ref> [Andre et al., 1986] </ref> describes in some detail algorithms which detect the applicability of particular prepositions. The CHAPTER 8. PERSPECTIVE AND CONCLUSIONS 171 usages covered include deictically anchored uses such as hinter dem Rathaus von hier aus (in English, behind the town hall from here).

Reference-contexts: This builds on the earlier work of <ref> [Badler, 1975] </ref>, which outlined a general framework for the production of natural language descriptions of movies of moving objects. In addition, other work [Waltz, 1981; Yuhan, 1991] has focused on the use of spatial language, but in the absence of visual grounding for semantics.

Reference-contexts: This emphasis on the final frame is a central defining feature of the system presented here, and it is worthwhile to note that there is some motivation for giving the final frame a privileged status, and that there are also interesting consequences of doing so. <ref> [Behrend, 1989] </ref> presents evidence that children and adults, when learning novel verbs, tend to consider the result of the verb the most important component of the verb's meaning. In the domain of motion, this would correspond to a focus on the endpoint of motion.

Similar ideas can also be found in <ref> [Bolinger, 1965; Chomsky and Lasnik, 1977; MacWhinney, 1989] </ref>. 4.3 Difficulties with Mutual Exclusivity For purposes of exposition, this chapter focuses on the learning of the eight English spatial terms listed below. Note that all eight are static, i.e. they do not involve motion.

In German, the orientation of the landmark surface which supports the trajector is significant, while it is not for English on.

Reference-contexts: These are then all updated such that corresponding links at different feature map locations are constrained to have the same weight. 13 There do exist differentiable functions which are similar in functionality to the maximum, such as the softmax function discussed in <ref> [Bridle, 1990] </ref>. The maximum was used here because it is simpler than softmax, and because the required deviation from straightforward back-propagation is both minor and effective. CHAPTER 5.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, there are a number of prepositions for which no such obvious abstraction over the various senses exists. For example, <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref> presents a semantic analysis of the English preposition over, detailing literally dozens of different senses. These do not lend themselves to the straightforward sort of analysis we offered for in. Rather, there seems to be a cluster of demonstrably distinct senses of this word. <p> In addition, (c) above does not fit this generalization (although the imagined path in (c) passes above the landmark). So a more detailed analysis is required, pointing out the various senses and their relations with one another, along the lines of <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref>. Polysemy is widespread throughout the lexicon. More to the point, it occurs even in the highly simplified visual domain we are studying here, which indicates that it is an issue that we will have to address. <p> The ten English spatial terms are above, below, left, right, around, in, on, out of, through, and over. (Note that the English preposition over is highly polysemous <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref>. For the time being we are considering only the sense of over which denotes motion over and across the landmark. Further study of the other senses is discussed in x7.1.1.) is the same as the architectures used above, except that there are ten output nodes instead of two. <p> EXTENSIONS 145 CHAPTER 7. EXTENSIONS 146 Note that there is no corresponding pair of senses for go over, which can only mean motion from one side of the landmark to the other, while passing through the region above it. The polysemy of over has been studied in detail <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref>, and appears to be exceedingly complex. For our purposes here in this preliminary study, it suffices to note that there is no obvious abstraction that covers all the senses of over without also including examples that we would not consider over. <p> Here, while Kim is probably not in fact physically lying across the table, the preposition is used because the implicit search path that would take me from where I am to where Kim is passes across the table. This phenomenon is referred to as end-point focus <ref> [Brugman, 1981; Lakoff, 1987] </ref>, since the trajector is located at the end-point of an implicit search path. Another example which seems to involve an implicit search path, although not through end-point focus, is His office is along the corridor, or alternatively His office is along here somewhere. <p> PERSPECTIVE AND CONCLUSIONS 174 the the polysemy of spatial prepositions in different linguistic contexts, without actual perceptual grounding. Her earlier work [Harris, 1989] was a connectionist approach to Claudia Brugman's analysis of the polysemy of the English preposition over <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref>. Like Munro et al, Harris uses feature vectors, including such perceptually-motivated features as above, contact, proximity, motion, and support. Unlike Munro, she also includes motion features, and more abstract features such as authority, which are needed to capture some of the metaphorical uses of the prepositions she studies.

Theoretical studies <ref> [Denker et al., 1987; Patarnello and Carnevali, 1987] </ref> have shown that the likelihood of correct generalization depends on the size of the hypothesis space (total number of networks 3 being considered), the size of the solution space (set of networks that give good generalization), and the number of training examples.

It is worth noting, however, that there are some fundamental differences between the maps found in the model and those in the brain.

Reference-contexts: Since learning under back-propagation tends to be more successful in shallow networks, this is an advantage that time-delay neural networks have over back-propagation through time. 3.4.3 Back-Propagation with State Units A popular approach to connectionist sequence learning is the use of state units <ref> [Elman, 1988; Jordan, 1986] </ref>. This is perhaps best exemplified by the work of Elman; the network architecture suggested in [Elman, 1988] is presented in Figure 3.7. In this figure, each box represents a layer of units. Thus, this is a standard 2-layer perceptron, with one addition, namely, the state units. <p> This is perhaps best exemplified by the work of Elman; the network architecture suggested in <ref> [Elman, 1988] </ref> is presented in Figure 3.7.

Reference-contexts: Having now covered the architecture itself in detail, and neuroscientific motivations for it briefly, we can move on to consider the system's performance. 5.4 Results The system was trained under quickprop <ref> [Fahlman, 1988] </ref>, a variant of back-propagation which exhibits fast convergence. The spatial terms were learned one at a time, using the architecture shown in Figure 5.10. <p> Clearly, the system appears to be quite sensitive to the actual frame in which inclusion occurred. Notice that those movies in which 8 The system was trained under "ordinary" back-propagation, rather than a second-order method such as quickprop <ref> [Fahlman, 1988] </ref>, because training in this fashion, without back-propagation through time or some other means of arriving at the true gradient, yields only an approximation to the gradient. Thus, a relatively "cautious" learning algorithm is called for. Training networks of this sort under quickprop has not generally been successful.

Reference-contexts: This characterization is clearly not correct, since it is unaffected by physical context. A more satisfying approach can be motivated by some recent work in perceptual psychology. <ref> [Freyd et al., 1988] </ref> present intriguing evidence that humans viewing static scenes (such as the ones in Figure 2.4) mentally represent the forces that are acting on the objects, keeping them where they are. <p> For instance, viewing a potted plant sitting on a table, a subject would mentally represent the force dynamics of the support relationship between table and pot, explicitly including some representation of the fact that if the table were not there, the pot would fall. In the words of <ref> [Freyd et al., 1988] </ref>, "subjects represent the underlying dynamics of coherent static scenes, so that when the forces are suddenly unbalanced, the mental representation includes an unfreezing of the potential motion implicit in the scene."

Reference-contexts: The only difference between the CHAPTER 2. LINGUISTIC ISSUES 18 LM two is the absence of the "supporting" triangle in the scene on the left. Thus, it is clear that the physical context in which a spatial relation occurs can profoundly influence the way it is categorized linguistically (see <ref> [Herskovits, 1986] </ref> for further examples of the effect of physical context in English linguistic categorization of spatial relations). <p> general notion that the categorization of spatial relations appears to rely upon the combination of evidence from a number of perceptual features. 2.3.3 Further Complications The examples presented here, unfortunately, barely begin to scratch the surface of the semantics of spatial prepositions in English (let alone those of other languages). <ref> [Herskovits, 1986] </ref> presents an array of further subtleties, such as the use of in to describe the relation of the pear to the bowl in Figure 2.9, despite the fact that the pear is not physically contained within the interior of the bowl. <p> In (a), we see two small square landmarks and a circular trajector above them.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, both the problem and the posited heuristic solution are very general in nature, and could be applied to domains other than the naming of either objects or spatial relations. In a related vein, <ref> [Johnston and Slobin, 1979] </ref> point out that in a study of children learning locative terms in English, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, and Turkish, terms were learned more quickly when there was little or no synonymy among terms.

Reference-contexts: Since learning under back-propagation tends to be more successful in shallow networks, this is an advantage that time-delay neural networks have over back-propagation through time. 3.4.3 Back-Propagation with State Units A popular approach to connectionist sequence learning is the use of state units <ref> [Elman, 1988; Jordan, 1986] </ref>. This is perhaps best exemplified by the work of Elman; the network architecture suggested in [Elman, 1988] is presented in Figure 3.7. In this figure, each box represents a layer of units. Thus, this is a standard 2-layer perceptron, with one addition, namely, the state units.

Reference-contexts: These are contours which are perceived by human observers of particular visual stimuli, but which do not correspond to physical luminance or color discontinuities in the image (see <ref> [Kanizsa, 1979] </ref> for a review of this phenomenon). So the results of von der Heydt et al are striking because they point out that there are cells in visual cortex which respond to orientations which are not physically there in the image.

Reference-contexts: Before moving on to present the details of this architecture, however, it is worthwhile noting briefly that there is also a non-linguistic source of motivation for the conceptual decomposition of motion events into source, path, and destination: this is the visual phenomenon of apparent motion <ref> [Kolers, 1972] </ref>. Human subjects, when presented with an object displayed briefly at one position in the visual field, and then with another copy of the object displayed at another position, often perceive the object moving smoothly from the first point to the second.

Reference-contexts: In addition, as mentioned in Chapter 1, space (along with time) has a privileged position as a fundamental conceptual structuring device in language, while most other domains, color included, do not. <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref> points out that [m]any scholars believe that some parts of a conceptual system are more fundamental than others. Concepts like space and time are usually taken as the most fundamental. Concepts like chutzpah in Yiddish or agape in Ancient Greek are taken as more superficial. <p> So, though it is clear CHAPTER 2. LINGUISTIC ISSUES 22 that it makes sense to use a given preposition in some situation, it would often also make sense to use another. Only convention justifies the correct choice. (Emphasis added). This is similar in spirit to the viewpoint, voiced by <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref>, that it is unhelpful to view the relation between the "core" or central sense of a word to other senses as either, on the one hand, entirely predictable, or, on the other hand, entirely arbitrary. <p> movie dealt with in this thesis contains a single trajector, either moving or statically located relative to a single landmark object. 2.4.3 Prototype Effects in Categorization Eleanor Rosch's work on the phenomenon of prototypicality in categorization [Rosch, 1973; Rosch, 1977; Rosch, 1978] has attracted the attention of several cognitive linguists <ref> [Lakoff, 1987; Langacker, 1987] </ref>. The attraction which prototype-based categorization has held can be seen as stemming from an awareness of serious problems encountered with the idea of defining natural language categories by lists of necessary and sufficient conditions for membership. <p> We now focus on the motivation for the built-in structures, just what it is about the movie that they capture, and how they do it. The central motivation for the design is borrowed from cognitive linguistics. <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref> notes that linguistically, events are often structured in terms of three components: a source, or point of origin for motion, a path, or trajectory traced through space by the CHAPTER 6. <p> Here, while Kim is probably not in fact physically lying across the table, the preposition is used because the implicit search path that would take me from where I am to where Kim is passes across the table. This phenomenon is referred to as end-point focus <ref> [Brugman, 1981; Lakoff, 1987] </ref>, since the trajector is located at the end-point of an implicit search path. Another example which seems to involve an implicit search path, although not through end-point focus, is His office is along the corridor, or alternatively His office is along here somewhere.

Reference-contexts: On a more specific level, the purpose is to present a number of issues that cognitive linguists have concerned themselves with, and which are dealt with in this thesis, mostly as extensions to the central architecture, in Chapter 7. 2.4.1 An Overview <ref> [Langacker, 1987] </ref>, in introducing the field of cognitive linguistics, begins by stating that [l]anguage is an integral part of human cognition. <p> movie dealt with in this thesis contains a single trajector, either moving or statically located relative to a single landmark object. 2.4.3 Prototype Effects in Categorization Eleanor Rosch's work on the phenomenon of prototypicality in categorization [Rosch, 1973; Rosch, 1977; Rosch, 1978] has attracted the attention of several cognitive linguists <ref> [Lakoff, 1987; Langacker, 1987] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: this approach holds that it is unrealistic to expect unstructured networks to be able to be able to handle large, complex problems in inherently structured domains, such as language and vision, and that a more promising route is the incorporation into the network architecture of knowledge regarding the target domain. <ref> [LeCun, 1989] </ref> notes that such incorporation of prior knowledge will tend to lead to superior generalization from the training set: Considering [back-propagation] as a general learning rule that can be used as a CHAPTER 3. CONNECTIONISM 33 black box for a wide variety of problems is, of course, wishful thinking. <p> The motivation and design of these structures is the central focus of Chapter 5 and Chapter 6. Many connectionist learning systems are structured to one degree or another. Examples of connectionist systems which incorporate knowledge of the target domain into their architectures are the hand-written digit recognizers of <ref> [LeCun, 1989; Keeler et al., 1991] </ref>, the equilateral triangle recognizer of [Ahmad and Omohundro, 1990], the parser of [Jain et al., 1992], the object segmentation and recognition systems of [Mozer et al., 1991; Hummel and Biederman, 1990; Poggio and Edelman, 1990], and the perceptually-grounded 3 By the term "network", LeCun means <p> This constraint is easily enforced using the technique of weight-sharing <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986; LeCun, 1989] </ref>. Back-propagation through time has the disadvantage that it consumes a good deal of memory by replicating network nodes. Furthermore, the resulting "unfolded" networks can be quite deep 5 , particularly for long sequences. <p> This yields a very simple center-surround receptive field. * The weights of corresponding links at all different positions are constrained to be identical (see <ref> [LeCun, 1989] </ref> for details on this technique of weight-sharing).

Reference-contexts: In contrast, much prior work in structured connectionism has focused either on non-learning systems <ref> [Cooper, 1989; Olson, 1989; Weber, 1989a; Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1990] </ref>, or on systems in which the structures were composed of essentially the same sort of units as the rest of the network [Hinton, 1986; Fanty, 1988; Harris, 1991]. <p> In the terms we are using here, given the source and then the destination, the subjects perceptually infer the path. Thus, source and destination serve as anchor-points of sorts, from which the path is computed. Connectionist research in modeling this phenomenon <ref> [Olson, 1989] </ref> has focused on the computation of explicit trajectories given starting and ending points. Returning now to the architecture at hand, it is easy to see how one might represent the elements of source and destination.

Reference-contexts: Tailoring the network architecture to the task can be thought of as a way of reducing the size of the space of possible functions that the network can generate, without overly reducing its computational power. Theoretical studies <ref> [Denker et al., 1987; Patarnello and Carnevali, 1987] </ref> have shown that the likelihood of correct generalization depends on the size of the hypothesis space (total number of networks 3 being considered), the size of the solution space (set of networks that give good generalization), and the number of training examples.

Reference-contexts: In fact, there exists a wide array of methods; the interested reader may find reviews in <ref> [Hertz et al., 1991; Pearlmutter, 1990] </ref>. Nonetheless, these are three of the most commonly used connectionist approaches to sequence learning.

This is a point against the method of back propagation through time in general. Since we assume here that movies may be of arbitrary length, this is potentially a serious problem with this method.

Reference-contexts: CHAPTER 3. CONNECTIONISM 31 The field of connectionism has had a checkered history. Early work [McCulloch and Pitts, 1943; Hebb, 1949] held out the promise of a relatively simple and easily understood biological grounding for our understanding of intelligence, and <ref> [Rosenblatt, 1962] </ref> in particular excited interest with a proof of convergence for an algorithm to train the weights of simple one-layer perceptrons (i.e. perceptrons without hidden units), so that a given perceptron could learn to adapt itself to various tasks.

Reference-contexts: We proceed now to consider first the technical, and then the scientific, contributions made by the work described here. 1.3 Technical Contributions The system whose design and construction form the central focus of this thesis is a connectionist network, trained under error back propagation <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>. 2 The architecture and training regimen associated with this system feature a number of novel techniques, which are potentially of general use across a wide range of applications. <p> This state of affairs continued until the recent resurgence of interest in multi-layer perceptrons, brought about by the development of a training algorithm which is able to train weights in such a perceptron. This is the back-propagation algorithm <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>. 2 This, together with somewhat earlier work in neurally-inspired computational models based on ideas from statistical mechanics [Hopfield, 1982; Hopfield, 1984], led to a renewal of interest in the field of connectionist or neural network models generally. <p> For a full exposition, see <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>. When being trained under back-propagation, a network takes an input vector as input, and produces an output vector at the output node (s). <p> Since this is a recurrent network, it cannot be trained using a straightforward application of the back-propagation algorithm, which assumes a feed-forward architecture. Given this, one approach to training such a network to recognize sequences is to "unfold the network over time" <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>, as shown in Figure 3.5. Here, the recurrent network of Figure 3.4 has been transformed into a feed-forward network of depth t + 1, where t + 1 is the length of the input sequence, by replicating node a once for each step in the sequence. <p> This constraint is easily enforced using the technique of weight-sharing <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986; LeCun, 1989] </ref>. Back-propagation through time has the disadvantage that it consumes a good deal of memory by replicating network nodes. Furthermore, the resulting "unfolded" networks can be quite deep 5 , particularly for long sequences. <p> in the form of training points (i.e. point trajectors) relative to landmarks, as shown previously, that it must classify its input into one or more of the spatial categories which label the output nodes shown at the top of Figure 4.3, and finally, that it is trained under error back-propagation <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>. At attempt has been made to make this presentation as general as possible, so that the ideas involved may be applied to other domains. We present here the means by which the intuitive notion of "weakening of evidence from implicit negative instances" is implemented. <p> into the frame analyzer, and in order for this error signal to have much of an effect, the weights that link the frame analyzer to the hidden layer above it will need to be substantial, since the formula for computing the error signal involves a multiplication by these weights (see <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>). But if this is the case, it means that during the forward pass, the contents of the Current buffer of the frame analyzer will in turn have an effect on the representation formed in the hidden layer above it.

Reference-contexts: This process of coercion corresponds to part of Herskovits' proposed theory of the interpretation of locative expressions. As we shall see below, others have also picked up on this notion, including myself. <ref> [Andre et al., 1986; Schirra et al., 1987] </ref> present the Citytour system, produced by the Vitra project at the University of the Saarland in Germany. This system outputs German descriptions of the motions and positions of such objects as cars, churches, and post offices relative to one another.

Reference-contexts: As we have seen, the system presented in this thesis does exhibit graded responses of the sort that might be expressed using the above expressions. Another Vitra system, named Soccer <ref> [Schirra, 1990] </ref>, which describes a soccer match viewed from above, remedies this situation by introducing so-called "probability clouds" relative to a landmark object. These indicate the degree of applicability of a particular preposition for a trajector located at some position relative to the landmark.

Jeffrey Siskind Some of the work of Jeffrey Siskind <ref> [Siskind, 1992; Siskind, 1990; Siskind, 1991] </ref> focuses on the perception and linguistic categorization of events in a movie of humanoid stick figures moving back and forth, placing balls on tables, and the like.

Reference-contexts: The systems of <ref> [Sopena, 1988] </ref>, [Allen, 1990], and [Bartell and Cottrell, 1991] represent efforts in this direction, accepting much simplified perceptual input, and learning to associate it with natural language descriptions of that input.

Reference-contexts: If the supporting surface is roughly horizontal, as in the scene on the left in Figure 2.3, the preposition auf is used to describe the relation.

Nonetheless, there are a number of additional phenomena from other languages which deserve mention.

Reference-contexts: This attempt, based on a combination of Sutton's method of temporal differences <ref> [Sutton, 1988] </ref> and standard back propagation, was not successful. 8.1.2 Related Learning Systems A number of researchers have addressed the issue of learning to associate linguistic forms with perceptally grounded semantics, and thus have focused on problems much like those presented in this thesis.

INTRODUCTION 7 They [closed-class forms] represent only certain categories, such as space, time (hence, also form, location, and motion), perspective point, distribution of attention, force, causation, knowledge state, reality status, and the current speech event, to name some main ones. <p> Nonetheless, there are a number of additional phenomena from other languages which deserve mention. Some of these are listed below. * Atsugewi: <ref> [Talmy, 1983] </ref> presents a set of verbal suffixes from Atsugewi, a California Indian language. The suffixes presented mark distinctions which are much finer than those made by English prepositions. <p> Other salient entities in a relational predication are referred to as landmarks (lm), so called because they are naturally viewed (in prototypical instances) as providing points of reference for locating the trajector. These characterizations are are essentially the same as the concepts of figure and ground described in <ref> [Talmy, 1983] </ref>, such that figure corresponds to trajector, and ground corresponds to landmark.

Reference-contexts: that have not been handled yet (as in the sentence "The circle is over the square from here"); with the addition of a deictic center to the system, this sense could perhaps be learned along with the other senses that the system is already able to learn. 7.1.3 Force Dynamics <ref> [Talmy, 1987] </ref> has focused attention on the "force dynamic" component of semantics: how entities interact with respect to force, noting that concepts such as exertion of force, CHAPTER 7.

Reference-contexts: landmark, but in different ways: * Proximal orientation is the orientation of the (imaginary) directed line segment connecting the landmark to the trajector where the two objects are closest. 2 Further evidence for the imputation of motion to static scenes, albeit under somewhat different circumstances, comes from a phenomenon which <ref> [Talmy, 1990] </ref> refers to as "fictive motion". <p> In these uses of along, the only thing that is actually along the landmark (the corridor in this case) is the imagined search path that will take the listener from where he is to the trajector. This is related to Talmy's notion of fictive motion <ref> [Talmy, 1990] </ref>. Talmy notes that sentences such as Those rods go through the ceiling, CHAPTER 7.

Reference-contexts: PERSPECTIVE AND CONCLUSIONS 170 on systems which learn to perform such tasks. 8.1.1 Related Non-Learning Systems There are a number of systems which perceive events with the purpose of producing some linguistic or semantic description of the events viewed, without learning to do so. These include the work of <ref> [Thibadeau, 1986] </ref> in the perception of actions, based on [Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976], and the work of [Tsotsos, 1981], which presents an expert system for motion understanding in the context of the functioning of the left ventricle of the human heart.

Reference-contexts: In addition, <ref> [Tomasello, 1987] </ref> presents psycholinguistic data in which English prepositions which are members of antonym pairs (e.g. in, out, over, under) are learned earlier than other prepositions which are not (e.g. by, at).

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting, however, that there are some fundamental differences between the maps found in the model and those in the brain. Most particularly, the mapping to visual cortex is in fact logarithmic <ref> [Tootell et al., 1982] </ref>, such that logarithmically spaced concentric rings in a visual stimulus map to equally-spaced concentric rings in the cortical representation.

Reference-contexts: This "filling-in" operation is accomplished using a simple spreading mechanism, similar to the basic operation of spreading activation proposed in Shimon Ullman's work on visual routines <ref> [Ullman, 1984] </ref>. 7 There are of course other means to accomplish this task; for example, [Sejnowski and Hinton, 1987] present a model based on the Boltzmann machine [Ackley et al., 1987] which performs a similar operation. This might be used in place of the mechanism used here. <p> This emphasis on situated language use requires that the system be able to perceive spatial relations among the objects in the video game world, and this is accomplished through a set of "visual operators", based on Shimon Ullman's work on visual routines <ref> [Ullman, 1984] </ref>. An example of such an operator is the flood-fill operation which was presented in Chapter 5, and which is used in my system for determining the interiors of obects.
