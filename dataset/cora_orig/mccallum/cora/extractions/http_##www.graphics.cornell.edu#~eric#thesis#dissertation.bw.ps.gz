Title: Mathematical Models and Monte Carlo Algorithms for Physically Based Rendering  
Author: Eric Lafortune 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering Katholieke Universiteit Leuven  
Abstract: Algorithms for image synthesis render photo-realistic imagery, given the description of a scene. Physically based rendering specifically stresses the physical correctness of the algorithms and their results. The algorithms perform an accurate simulation of the behaviour of light, in order to faithfully render global illumination effects such as soft shadows, glossy reflections and indirect illumination. In this dissertation we investigate image-based Monte Carlo rendering algorithms. We pay special attention to their correctness, their versatility and their efficiency. First of all, we discuss theoretical frameworks that describe the global illumination problem. These formal mathematical models are the first step to ensure the correctness of the eventual results. Moreover, they allow to apply standard numerical techniques to compute a solution. We give an overview of existing models, which are based on the rendering equation and the potential equation. We then introduce a model based on a new concept, called the global reflectance distribution function. It combines the ideas of radiance and potential into a single function, which is defined by a set of two integral equations. We later show that, while the three models are equivalent, a straightforward Monte Carlo approach to solve them leads to entirely different rendering algorithms. We chose to apply Monte Carlo methods because of their versatility. First, we give an overview of Monte Carlo techniques in general. The variance of a technique provides a measure for the stochastic errors on its results. The basic strategy of Monte Carlo methods is to reduce the variance by averaging the results of large numbers of samples. Convergence is slow, however. Variance reduction techniques therefore try to improve the efficacy of the individual samples, by taking into account information about the integrand. We discuss techniques such as stratified sampling, importance sampling, the combining of estimators, control variates, Russian roulette and next event estimation. We stress their unbiasedness, which ensures that the estimators always converge to the exact solution. We specifically analyse aspects that are of importance for the global illumination problem and we present a few improvements to existing techniques. Finally, we apply the Monte Carlo methods to the mathematical models of the global illumination problem. The different models give rise to entirely different algorithms. The rendering equation leads to the well-known path tracing algorithm, while the potential equation leads to the light tracing algorithm. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We study the application of the variance reduction techniques and present results from practical experiments. The global reflectance distribution function and its equations give rise to a new algorithm, which we have called bidirectional path tracing. This algorithm proves to have superior qualities for rendering typical indirectly illuminated interior scenes.

Reference-contexts: The original normalised PDFs p i (fi x ) of Eq. (4.3), on the basis of the BRDFs, implicitly entail a transformation to a different parameter space, as discussed in general in Section 3.4. We will write this parameter space explicitly using (~ 1 ; ~ 2 ) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1]. <p> We will write this parameter space explicitly using (~ 1 ; ~ 2 ) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1]. <p> Earlier algorithms invariably store the results from a shooting step in some kind of data structure; they only use these results in a subsequent gathering step. This approach yields a host of two-pass or multi-pass algorithms. An early example is backward ray tracing, introduced by Arvo <ref> [1] </ref> in '86. It has evolved into various bidirectional or multi-pass ray tracing algorithms, e.g. presented by Heckbert [43], by Chen et al. [11] and by Collins [18]. They all use different types of data structures to store the diffuse illumination from a stochastic light shooting step.

Reference-contexts: The control variates are based on a constant estimate for the ambient radiance L a in the scene. The control variate is then proportional to the BRDF times a cosine factor. For the modified Phong BRDF this factor can be integrated analytically using an algorithm proposed by Arvo <ref> [2] </ref>. The reduction of the variance and the RMS errors depends on the quality of the estimate. of samples per pixel. The control variate equals the ambient radiance times the BRDF and the cosine factor.

Reference-contexts: This effect is related to the question of how many rays should be traced at each reflection. Each of the recursive integrals can be estimated by any number of 96 CHAPTER 4. MC METHODS APPLIED TO GLOBAL ILLUMINATION samples. Arvo and Kirk <ref> [6] </ref> already mention that it is difficult to determine an optimal number a priori. In many practical scenes sampling the objects seen through a pixel and the camera aperture is a much simpler problem than sampling reflections over the hemisphere.

Again, the information stored is either diffuse or coarsely directional, because of storage considerations.

Reference-contexts: This allows for very complex and large scenes. With the proper optimisation techniques the complexity of ray intersection tests is reported to be O (log N ), where N is the number of primitives in the scene <ref> [24, 75] </ref>. The combination of low memory requirements and a ray tracing approach thus yields an excellent scalability to render complex scenes. The view-dependency and light source-dependency additionally ensures that most computational effort is spent on parts of the scene that matter for the final image.

Reference-contexts: Boundary element methods such as the radiosity method store information for each of the elements of the discretised surfaces. The information is usually restricted to the diffuse component of the illumination, although extensions to store directional information as well have been proposed, e.g. by discretising the hemisphere <ref> [49] </ref> or by using spherical harmonics [116]. Ward [134, 133] uses an octree that is independent from the surfaces to store diffuse illumination along with information about the gradients.

Reference-contexts: Filtering techniques are an obvious example. Simple Gaussian filters or median filters can be applied to the final image, to reduce the random noise and the disturbing bright spikes, e.g. <ref> [51] </ref>. Rushmeier and Ward [97] suggest alternative and physically more sound filters. All filters do however introduce a bias in each individual pixel, because the results of neighbouring pixels now affect one another. Additionally filtering and caching in object space can further reduce the required number of samples.

Reference-contexts: It has evolved into various bidirectional or multi-pass ray tracing algorithms, e.g. presented by Heckbert [43], by Chen et al. [11] and by Collins [18]. They all use different types of data structures to store the diffuse illumination from a stochastic light shooting step. Jensen en Christensen <ref> [52] </ref> and Shirley et al. [111] store all possible information from such a step, but only to perform density estimation afterwards. As with the other techniques, this smoothes out the illumination.

Reference-contexts: Without additional lenses the plane of focus is the film plane or the virtual screen itself. Again algorithms for image synthesis can easily omit depth of field by using a perfect pin-hole point instead of a finite aperture. Kolb et al. <ref> [61] </ref> discuss the modelling and application of more complex lens systems. In image synthesis, the pin-hole and the film plane behind it correspond to the eye point and the virtual screen in front of it.

Reference-contexts: Both the gathering and the shooting approach have their advantages and disadvantages. This begs for an algorithm that integrates both ideas and hopefully combines their strengths. In <ref> [62] </ref> we have presented a third alternative that does exactly this. In [65] we have explained its theoretical background, which we will also discuss here. <p> The resulting algorithm is called bidirectional path tracing. It was introduced by us in <ref> [62] </ref>, while Veach and Guibas later independently presented a similar algorithm in [125]. To our knowledge it is the first pure Monte Carlo rendering algorithm that combines the ideas of shooting light from the light sources and gathering light through the pixels. <p> We already mentioned that the various path tracing and light tracing algorithms can be regarded as specific instantiations of the generic bidirectional path tracing algorithm by choosing simple sets of weights. These weights do not fully exploit the potential of bidirectional path tracing however. In <ref> [62, 65] </ref> we presented some heuristics to compute weights on the basis of the reflectance characteristics of the surfaces on the eye path.

Reference-contexts: However, in Section 3.8 we have shown that it can improve the results if the PDF is subcritical. This is the case when sampling the rendering equation (2.11) using the PDF of Eq. (4.3). In <ref> [64] </ref> we have therefore proposed to derive a simple control variate, proportional to the PDF, by assuming that the incoming radiance is equal to some constant ambient radiance L a (Fig. 4.10).

Reference-contexts: One usually has to sample according to approximate PDFs instead and apply the more general expression of Eq. (4.1). The estimator is unbiased but may have a larger variance. In <ref> [66] </ref> we discuss various aspects of importance sampling according to a modified Phong BRDF. More importantly, the PDFs may not be ideal because of the unknown radiance function in the integrals. Simple importance sampling ignores this factor, although it may have a large influence on the shape of the integrand. <p> The program furthermore supports area light sources and spot light sources. All area light sources are perfect Lambertian emitters, while the spot lights are point light sources with a Phong-like angular distribution. The BRDFs are modelled as modified Phong BRDFs that are physically plausible <ref> [72, 73, 66] </ref>. Image texture maps and procedural texture maps make it possible to add small optical details. The camera model computes average radiance values (cfr. Appendix A.2). <p> We have therefore used a comparable sampling approach, which is explained in <ref> [66] </ref>. Moreover, each PDF is only an averaged version of the PDFs for each colour component, as we only select a single reflection direction at each intersection point. For coloured surfaces the averaged PDF is thus rarely ideal for any of the colour components.

Reference-contexts: A more sophisticated approach could be to apply different values for different points and directions. The improvements that are proposed in the next section do exactly this, based in additional information about the illumination. 4.1.7 Improved Importance Sampling and Control Variates In <ref> [67] </ref> we have presented further improvements to the importance sampling and control variates of Sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.6. These variance reduction techniques are typically based on the local reflectance characteristics of the surfaces, which represent an important factor of the integrand. <p> Figure 5.9 illustrates this effect for test scene C, rendered with only 10 samples per pixel. We have not repeated the experiments with the improved importance sampling and control variates that were presented in <ref> [67] </ref>. These show that the RMS errors can be reduced by 30% for test scene A, rendered with pure path tracing , and by 20 to 25% for test scene C, rendered with path tracing with next event estimation.

Reference-contexts: Our bidirectional path tracing algorithm does not use any such data structures. For each sample it immediately links the original light path and eye path. Working with the original, unfiltered samples thus ensures that the method remains unbiased. Reducing the Number of Shadow Rays In <ref> [68] </ref> we have shown how the large number of shadow rays can be reduced by introducing an additional Russian roulette process. This is an extension to the principle presented by Shirley [106, 107] and by Shirley and Wang [112]. The lighting contributions typically vary 4.3.

Reference-contexts: This allows for very complex and large scenes. With the proper optimisation techniques the complexity of ray intersection tests is reported to be O (log N ), where N is the number of primitives in the scene <ref> [24, 75] </ref>. The combination of low memory requirements and a ray tracing approach thus yields an excellent scalability to render complex scenes. The view-dependency and light source-dependency additionally ensures that most computational effort is spent on parts of the scene that matter for the final image.

Reference-contexts: There are a few alternative approaches to start with, depending on whether one strives for absolute realism or for photo-realism. A first alternative goal of a synthetic image may be to recreate the same visual experience for the viewer as if he were watching the actual scene <ref> [78] </ref>. Figure A.1 explains this approach. The visual perception of the viewer of a scene is determined by the field of radiance values reaching the eye point.

Pattanaik notes that the results of his light tracing algorithm improve by applying this absorption suppression technique <ref> [83, p. 91] </ref>. This effect is related to the question of how many rays should be traced at each reflection. Each of the recursive integrals can be estimated by any number of 96 CHAPTER 4. MC METHODS APPLIED TO GLOBAL ILLUMINATION samples. <p> This starting point yields image-based algorithms. Alternatively the sets could consist of the points and directions corresponding to finite elements. Section 4.2 on light tracing already mentioned that the technique is better suited to compute the fluxes of finite elements, as in Pattanaik's particle tracing algorithm <ref> [83] </ref>. It is a light shooting method and as such it efficiently takes into account the light sources. On the other hand it may miss receiving elements, especially if they are small.

Reference-contexts: Adaptive sampling is another common technique. It concentrates the computational efforts on regions of the image or of the scene that are considered particularly complex. Various strategies have been presented, e.g. in <ref> [90, 99, 129, 110] </ref>. Adaptive sampling can be effective at reducing the number of rays that have to be traced.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is thus quite useless for computing fluxes for pixels, 4.2. LIGHT TRACING 85 unless the camera aperture is excessively large. In their system to assess the visibility of a road in a foggy atmosphere Roze et al. <ref> [92] </ref> apply a light tracing algorithm. In order to obtain acceptable results they model the eye as a disc with a 0:8m radius. Pattanaik [84, 83, 88, 87, 85, 89] does use an instance of this light tracing algorithm to compute fluxes leaving diffuse elements from a finite element representation. <p> The approach can be similar to the extension of the path tracing algorithm by Rushmeier [93, 94] and the light tracing algorithm for foggy atmospheres by Roze et al. <ref> [92] </ref>. By not only scattering rays and casting shadow rays at surfaces, but also inside participating media the resulting global illumination effects could be taken into account efficiently.

Reference-contexts: As with the other techniques, this smoothes out the illumination. Source selection methods as proposed by Kok and Jansen [58, 60] and similar final rendering steps, e.g. <ref> [93, 11] </ref>, gather light from a radiosity solution, which is often computed in a shooting step. Again, the information stored is either diffuse or coarsely directional, because of storage considerations. <p> Nothing precludes considering them in the mathematical models however.

Reference-contexts: Filtering techniques are an obvious example.

Reference-contexts: The resulting algorithm is called bidirectional path tracing. It was introduced by us in [62], while Veach and Guibas later independently presented a similar algorithm in <ref> [125] </ref>. To our knowledge it is the first pure Monte Carlo rendering algorithm that combines the ideas of shooting light from the light sources and gathering light through the pixels. <p> Estimator C 1;1 actually corresponds to the C 0;0 defined earlier, which we will redefine in the next paragraph.

Reference-contexts: If it does not hit an object (green ray) an illumination contribution is added to the pixel. If it does hit an object (red rays) no contribution is added. 4.1. PATH TRACING 79 4.1.5 Combining Estimators One of the applications presented by Veach and Guibas <ref> [126] </ref> for their heuristics to combine different estimators is the computation of direct illumination. In pure path tracing direct illumination at each point on the eye path is estimated by sampling the hemisphere, preferably according to the BRDF. <p> Practical tests presented in <ref> [126] </ref> and in Chapter 5 strongly indicate its efficiency for a wide range of illumination conditions. 80 CHAPTER 4. MC METHODS APPLIED TO GLOBAL ILLUMINATION 4.1.6 Control Variates Control variates as discussed in Section 3.6 can also be applied to the mathematical models of the global illumination problem. <p> Especially images of scenes with complex illumination contain visibly less noise. Even though the estimators are unbiased, the heuristics lack a certain elegance and symmetry, and most of all some more fundamental theoretical support. The heuristics presented by Veach and Guibas <ref> [126] </ref>, which we have discussed in the context of general Monte Carlo methods in Section 3.5, offer better theoretical and practical qualities. <p> Figure 5.7 shows test scene A rendered with 500 samples per pixel, which can be compared to Fig. 5.6.

Reference-contexts: The information is usually restricted to the diffuse component of the illumination, although extensions to store directional information as well have been proposed, e.g. by discretising the hemisphere [49] or by using spherical harmonics [116]. Ward <ref> [134, 133] </ref> uses an octree that is independent from the surfaces to store diffuse illumination along with information about the gradients. Environment mapping techniques such as the one proposed by Reinhard et al. [91] store approximate incoming radiance values for a set of discrete directions. <p> Additionally filtering and caching in object space can further reduce the required number of samples. Rushmeier et al. [95] and Kok [59, 60] propose grouping the objects in simplified primitives, for instance. In his illumination simulation system Ward <ref> [134, 133, 132] </ref> caches and interpolates the diffuse component of the illumination in object space, to great success. Adaptive sampling is another common technique. It concentrates the computational efforts on regions of the image or of the scene that are considered particularly complex.

Reference-contexts: Pseudo-Monte Carlo methods with deterministic error bounds for instance, as proposed by Zaremba <ref> [136] </ref>, look most attractive. Spanier [120] has presented biased estimators that have a bias that rapidly decreases to 0, but a much smaller variance than their unbiased counterparts. Further research should point out if these techniques are useful for the rendering algorithms discussed in this dissertation. 6.3.

Reference-contexts: It is then also possible to use more sophisticated sampling techniques that take into account different factors than just self-emitted radiance, such as distance or subtended solid angle. Shirley et al. [112, 113] present several of these techniques for different types of luminaires. Zimmerman and Shirley <ref> [137] </ref> present a more complex approach to select between different sampling techniques depending on the characteristics of the light sources. In their particular algorithm the light sources have a vast range of characteristics as they comprise all the patches of the scene after a radiosity preprocessing step. 4.1.
