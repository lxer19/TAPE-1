Title: Combined Map-Based and Case-Based Path Planning for Mobile Robot Navigation

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated approach to mobile robot path planning by combining grid-map based and case-based methods. The map-based path planner is used to suggest new innovative solutions for a particular path planning problem. A probabilistic path transform method is introduced for grid-map based path planning which proposes several alternative solutions for a single path planning problem. The casebase is used to store the paths and evaluate their traversability. Using the casebase allows the robot to benefit from its former experiences while planning a new route. As the dynamic properties of the environment may change the exploration as well as the evaluation of the paths will allow the system to self-organize by forming a set of paths that will be safest to follow.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years, much progress has been made in robot navigation in dynamic environments. Robots with ability to navigate in changing environment are starting to appear in industry and take the place of AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) whose motion is restricted to certain predefined paths <ref> [1] </ref>. Still, the main task of these robots is the transport of parts and sub-assemblies between manufacturing cells, which, to a great extent, means following one and the same path in the majority of cases.

Reference-contexts: There is a good evidence that animals seem to prefer well defined and constant paths, even if it means longer travel distances <ref> [2] </ref>. The knowledge of these paths seems to be acquired in some cases (e.g. bees), in others they must be genetically preprogrammed (e.g. juvenile terns). The reason for preferring already known paths is obvious.

Reference-contexts: Thus, in case-based reasoning, learning is through accumulation of new cases. 1 Case-based reasoning seems to offer solutions to many problems in knowledge engineering such as knowledge elicitation, encoding and maintenance and is often viewed as low risk technology <ref> [3] </ref>. The ability to learn from past experience makes case-based systems suitable for use in changing environments.

Reference-contexts: Recently some attempts have been made to overcome the weaknesses of both of the methods by combining them together. An example of this kind of work is presented in <ref> [4] </ref> where a topological map is extracted from an occupancy grid map with the help of Voronoi diagrams and the topological map is then used for efficient path planning.

Reference-contexts: Among path planning methods that use grid-based maps we find the distance transform method <ref> [5] </ref>, the path transform [6] and path planning based on virtual diffusion process [7]. All these methods are able to find a path if one exists and do not require expensive computations. <p> It is not updated and contains unremovable objects and areas where the robot is not allowed to enter (e.g. for the sake of safety). The map-based path planner uses a probabilistic path transform method which is an extension of the distance transform method of Jarvis <ref> [5] </ref> and the path transform method of Zelinsky [6]. While distance transform and path transform methods assume that the environment is static, the probabilistic path transform method assumes that the environment contains dynamic obstacles and therefore the best path to the goal is not necessarily the shortest.

All these methods are able to find a path if one exists and do not require expensive computations. The distance transform method works by propagating distances from the goal through free space and the path is planned by following the cells with lowest values.

Reference-contexts: As, in reality, the environments are almost always dynamic, it is essential to consider the uncertainty while solving the path planning problem. The problem of uncertainty is most often tackled with local navigation methods by introducing the reflexive obstacle avoidance behaviour (see <ref> [8] </ref> for a survey). On the global level the concept of occupancy grids is used, where each grid cell has assigned to it a value of probability of it being occupied. However, the occupancy grid does not reflect the statistical properties of a particular cell.

Reference-contexts: In order to update all cells, a wandering behaviour might be invoked but if large real-world maps are considered a wandering would be time-consuming as well as risky. In addition, the difficulties in robot localization may lead to a very ambiguous updated map. An interesting approach is taken in <ref> [9] </ref> to cope with dynamic obstacles. In order to get statistical data cameras are mounted to the ceiling and information from these is incorporated into the grid-map. Our approach is to not update the map at all but use a casebase to reflect the dynamic changes in the environment.
