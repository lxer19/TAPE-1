Title: Neural Networks in an Artificial Life Perspective  
Author: Stefano Nolfi Domenico Parisi

Abstract: In the last few years several researchers within the Artificial Life and Mobile Robotics community used Artificial Neural Networks. Explicitly viewing Neural Networks in an Artificial Life perspective has a number of consequences that make research on what we will call Artificial Life Neural Networks ( ALNNs) rather different from traditional connectionist research. The aim of the paper is to make the differences between ALNNs and "classical" neural networks explicit.

This is due to the fact that neural networks tend to be isolated from everything else except the input and teaching input that a researcher may provide to a learning network.

Reference-contexts: individual organisms are member of a biological population of non-identical individuals which are born, live for some time, reproduce, and die, and in the case of human organisms, it is also a member of a cultural population of individuals sharing culturally inherited behaviors and artifacts (for a detailed analysis see <ref> [3] </ref>). In this paper we will limit ourselves to the analysis of three important factors: (a) the importance of living in an external environment, (b) the importance of having a body, (c) the importance to adapt to the environment through an evolutionary process. 2.

Reference-contexts: ALNNs Live in an Environment Artificial Life Neural Networks ( ALNNs) live in a physical environment. They are ecological networks <ref> [4] </ref>. This implies that in ALNNs, as in real organisms, it is the 2 physical environment that assigns a "semantics" to the output of the nervous system.

Reference-contexts: The input patterns that are received by classical neural networks in their input units have no grounding (in the same sense that symbols in symbol manipulation models are ungrounded <ref> [5] </ref>). An input pattern can be said to be grounded when it refers to something else beyond itself. The input patterns of classical neural networks do not refer to anything beyond themselves.

Reference-contexts: The network's output in one cycle can partly determine the network's input in the next cycle. Therefore, ALNNs can at least in part control their own input. If organisms are said to adapt to their environment by constructing internal models of the environment <ref> [6] </ref>, these models are likely to be constructed by learning how the environment responds to the organism's own actions, that is, by observing which changes in the environment or in the relation of the organism to the environment result from which actions.

Reference-contexts: Preferred input can be input to which a network already knows how to respond <ref> [7] </ref> or it can be input that allows the network to disambiguate or correctly recognize the objects encountered in the environment [8]. 3 Another consequence of living in a physical environment is that learning itself may be different in ALNNs and in classical neural networks.

What classical networks learn is simply to associate each input with the correct output.

Reference-contexts: What classical networks learn is simply to associate each input with the correct output. In contrast, since ALNNs partly control their own input with their output they can learn to generate output that allows them to experience the appropriate input during learning <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. In fact, ALNNs may be learning two different things.

Reference-contexts: In this case in fact several additional factors (e.g. friction, inertia, ambient light, noise, etc.) arising from the physical properties of the robot and of the environment should be necessarily taken into account <ref> [11] </ref>. Moreover only realistic types of sensors and actuators (instead of idealized ones that may not respect all physical constraints or can have an infinite precision) can be used.

Reference-contexts: Sometime the experimenter designs the rough architecture of the network by using her/his insights or biological data. However, even in this case, most of the initial conditions are randomly initialized. ALNNs, when subjected to a simulated evolutionary process <ref> [12] </ref>, are born by inheriting their initial state from other network (s) (i.e. their parents) and therefore do not start from scratch.
