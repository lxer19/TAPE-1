Abstract: A quasi-independence result holds for the go-back-n automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol and the sliding window flow control protocol if packet errors are independent. The result is independent of the magnitude of the packet error probability or the cost of an error. A parallel result for the selective repeat ARQ protocol, however, does not appear to hold. fl To be published in Computer Networks and ISDN Systems. This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant NCR91-16117. Parts of this paper were presented as evidence of quasi-independence in Sigmetrics 1990[7]. The proof of quasi-independence (Section 4) is new.

Reference-contexts: Here, E [ T gbn (N; w; p) ] is the expected time to absorption into (N,0) for this Markov Process. To compute the expected time to absorption, we use the algorithm in <ref> [1] </ref>. Let represent the vector 2 of times spent in each of the states before absorption. Let Q be the transition rate matrix obtained from the original transition rate matrix by deleting the rows and columns involving the absorbing states. <p> Also, let P (0) be the initial probability distribution of the non-absorbing states. Then the mean time spent in each state before absorption can be computed by solving for (see <ref> [1] </ref> ) in Q = P (0): (9) The expected time to absorption is then given by E [ T gbn (N; w; p) ] = i;j where i;j are the individual components of . The solution of (9) for the Markov Process in Figure 6 is especially simple.

The result is of course provably valid only for the models studied. (1) is easy to show when the window does not close (see for example <ref> [6] </ref>). For the case when the window does close, however, no such proof was known, although we have observed it empirically in many of our measurements and simulations over the past several years. The purpose of this paper is to give a proof for this observation. <p> In <ref> [6] </ref>, this result was shown to hold when the window did not close, i.e., it was shown that E [ T gbn (N; w = 1; p) ] = E [ T noErrors (N; w = 1) ] + N p t; (3) where * E [ T gbn (N; w <p> As before, let p be the aggregate probability of failure of a packet or its acknowledgment, and let q = 1 p: It was shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that, if the windows never closed then (3) holds even for generally distributed processing and transmission times. <p> This is a considerable simplification over using a general Gaussian elimination algorithm to solve (9). The solution to the system of equations in (11) and (12) agrees with the results in <ref> [6] </ref>, when the window size is infinite. To see this, consider w &gt; i; i.e., the window does not close at the i th level. <p> The expected time to transmit N packets is, therefore, E [ T gbn (N; w = 1; p) ] = N 1 + fl = N 1 + p=q 1 + fl ; (13) which was shown in <ref> [6] </ref>. 4.3 Proof of Quasi-Independence We begin this investigation with the solution to (9) for the Markov Chain in Figure 6. <p> The total time to transmit 12 packets for this case is 20 slots. When roundtrip 15 time, r w, the window does not close. Its performance, studied in <ref> [6] </ref>, was shown to obey the quasi-independence property (Equation (3) in Section 3). Here, we consider the case r &gt; w, i.e., when the window does close. <p> In <ref> [6] </ref>, it was shown that errors in the go-back-n protocol obeyed the negative binomial distribution: P r [k errorsjN packets] = k p k q N (36) The expectation of this distribution is N p=q: Using this and (34) and (35), we have E [T noErrors (N; w; r)] + (N <p> are packet errors, in which case the quasi-independence will almost certainly not hold. (For example, see numerical examples for go-back-n with congestion-dependent errors in [7].) However, if packet errors, transmission times and other system delays were independent, generally distributed random variables, and there were no windows, then (3) will hold <ref> [6, Section 6] </ref>. We do not expect these assumptions to hold in practice for systems with rate based flow control. 7 Acknowledgments We wish to thank Larry Landweber and John Strikwerda for many stimulating discussions.

Reference-contexts: If transmission rates are dependent on congestion, then most likely, so are packet errors, in which case the quasi-independence will almost certainly not hold. (For example, see numerical examples for go-back-n with congestion-dependent errors in <ref> [7] </ref>.) However, if packet errors, transmission times and other system delays were independent, generally distributed random variables, and there were no windows, then (3) will hold [6, Section 6].

Reference-contexts: An error is detected at the sender by either a timer interrupt or by a NACK from the receiver. At this point, if the sender backs up to the first packet in error and restarts the transmission, the strategy is referred to as go-back-n <ref> [9] </ref>. If, on the other hand, the sender retransmits only that packet which is in error, the strategy is called selective-repeat. The state machine of go-back-n is simpler than that of selective repeat.
