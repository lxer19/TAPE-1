Abstract: The advent of switched LAN and ATM technology is dramatically altering today's networking environment. Given the preponderance of existing Ethernet networks today, high-speed, switched and/or full- duplex Ethernet and Ethernet LAN Emulation over ATM are extremely important, as is bridging between Ethernet and ATM. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of these newly emerging technologies, using measurements from actual Ethernet and ATM products. The specific technologies evaluated include: 10 and 100 Mbps Ethernet, switched or unswitched, half-duplex or full-duplex; Ethernet LAN Emulation over ATM (with comparisons to Token Ring LAN Emulation); bridging between Ethernet and ATM, comparing a native Ethernet server vs. an ATM server. A mathematical model is presented to explain observed performance.

Reference-contexts: However, by virtue of it emulating existing LANs, LANE over ATM cannot provide the Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees or flow/connection control associated with native ATM. Discussed in <ref> [1] </ref> were those factors that influence the end-to-end throughput observed by a user at the application level, as they applied to a number of ATM adapters. <p> Sources of bottlenecks that can restrict end-to-end throughput include the inherent capacity of each in-series hardware or software resource, protocol effects, operating system effects, and inherent throughput costs associated with requisite header information defined by the standards committees (including ATM, SONET, various protocol layers, etc.). As pointed out in <ref> [1] </ref>, if a number of parameters that control the behavior of these protocols, etc. are not carefully tuned (see also [2]), and/or the in-series resources do not have sufficient capacity, the observed end-to-end performance may be much less than what the system could otherwise produce. <p> As would be expected, without burst mode enabled under Netware IPX (not shown), the throughput was significantly decreased, as the adapter must wait for an acknowledgment for each 1514 or 4K byte frame sent (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Ethernet-to-ATM Bridging (Mbps) vs. the file size (bytes) read across an IBM 8281 ATM-to-Ethernet bridge.

Reference-contexts: As pointed out in [1], if a number of parameters that control the behavior of these protocols, etc. are not carefully tuned (see also <ref> [2] </ref>), and/or the in-series resources do not have sufficient capacity, the observed end-to-end performance may be much less than what the system could otherwise produce. Therefore, in Section II below, we will present empirical evaluations of these technologies using properly tuned systems with sufficient resource capacity.

Reference-contexts: EMPIRICAL EVALUATIONS In this section, we discuss throughput experiments using the IBM 1 LAN Adapter for Ethernet TP, 100/10 PCI Ethernet adapter, 8271 EtherStreamer 1 Switch, 8281 ATM-to-Ethernet bridge, Turboways 1 25 and 100 ATM adapters, 8282 ATM concentrator and 8260 intelligent hub (containing a PRIZMA 1 ATM switch <ref> [3] </ref>).
