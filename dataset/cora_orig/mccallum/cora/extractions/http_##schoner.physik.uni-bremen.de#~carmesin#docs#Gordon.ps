Abstract: General Theory & Quantitative Results Abstract: The human genotype represents at most ten billion binary informations, whereas the human brain contains more than a million times a billion synapses. So a differentiated brain structure is essentially due to self-organization. Such self-organization is relevant for areas ranging from medicine to the design of intelligent complex systems. Many brain structures emerge as collective phenomenon of a microscopic neurosynaptic dynamics: a stochastic dynamics mimics the neuronal action potentials, while the synaptic dynamics is modeled by a local coupling dynamics of type Hebb-rule, that is, a synaptic efficiency increases after coincident spiking of pre- and postsynaptic neuron. The microscopic dynamics is transformed to a collective dynamics reminiscent of hydrodynamics. The theory models empirical findings quantitatively: Topology preserving neuronal maps were assumed by Descartes in 1664; their self-organization was suggested by Weiss in 1928; their empirical observation was reported by Marshall in 1941; it is shown that they are neurosynaptically stable due to ubiquitous infinitesimal short range electrical or chemical leakage. In the visual cortex, neuronal stimulus orientation preference emerges; empirically measured orientation patterns are determined by the Poisson equation of electrostatics; this Poisson equation orientation pattern emergence is derived here. Complex cognitive abilities emerge when the basic local synaptic changes are regulated by valuation, emergent valuation, attention, attention focus or combination of subnetworks. Altogether a general theory is presented for the emergence of functionality from synaptic growth in neuro-biological systems. The theory provides a transformation to a collective dynamics and is used for quantitative modeling of empirical data.

Reference-contexts: Hence the essential question is: Where do the synaptic connections come from? While the biophysics of action potentials is understood quantitatively since Hodgkin and Huxley [13], that of synaptic change is hardly understood quantitatively. However an essential qualitative understanding is established by the so-called Hebb-rule <ref> [12, 16] </ref>: Synaptic change is provided by local metabolic events and thus depends on pre- and postsynaptic activity; in particular a synaptic efficiency increases after coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity. <p> In a continuous time limit one may express the above difference equation by a differential equation [2, 8]. Adiabatic limit. In most neuronal systems, the synaptic changes per time are relatively small compared to the neuronal changes per time <ref> [16] </ref>. Accordingly one may analyze the dynamics in the so-called adiabatic limit [11, 10]. In this limit, a representative number of presynaptic neuronal states ~n (t) occurs, before the couplings change significantly; so one may perform the average over the presynaptic neuronal states in the above equation. <p> so-called cortical maps, especially simple are cortical maps with each map neuron receiving input directly or indirectly from a sensor neuron of an area of sensor neurons; examples are the retinotopic maps (see Fig. (1)) with sensor neurons in the retina and somatosensory maps with sensor neurons at the skin <ref> [16] </ref>. In these maps neighboring sensor neurons project to neighboring map neurons (up to non-generic discontinuities), that is, the topology is preserved. Local neurosynaptic self-organization of topology preservation. <p> neuron; this fact and the modeled dynamics may be regarded as an adequate modeling of a third ontogenetic step of cortical maps; while in the first step neurons migrate to target positions and in the second step axons grow roughly to target areas, both according to chemical or other markers <ref> [16] </ref>. Moreover, these earlier models do not exhibit a potential function, while the present change potential is embedded in the theory of statistical physics and in a coherent theory of neuronal adaptation [2, 8]. <p> In mammals, the visual signals are transmitted from the retina via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the primary visual cortex, in particular to the areas 17 and 18 (Brodmann notation) <ref> [16] </ref>. In these areas there are neurons that respond preferentially to a stimulation by edges with a particular orientation, as was discovered by Hubel and Wiesel [14, 15].

Reference-contexts: So we get the formal orientation energy as follows. H = 2 hi;ji Here the brackets below the sum indicate the summation over next nearest neighbors and the factor 1/2 compensates the double summation of pairs. This formal energy is that of the so-called x-y-model <ref> [18] </ref>. By definition, an x-y-model is a model of interacting dipoles. Resulting orientation patterns. <p> This formal energy is that of the so-called x-y-model [18]. By definition, an x-y-model is a model of interacting dipoles. Resulting orientation patterns.
