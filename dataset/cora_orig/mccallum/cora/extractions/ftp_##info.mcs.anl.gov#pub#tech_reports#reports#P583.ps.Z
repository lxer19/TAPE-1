Abstract: High-speed wide area networks are expected to enable innovative applications that integrate geographically distributed, high-performance computing, database, graphics, and networking resources. However, there is as yet little understanding of the higher-level services required to support these applications, or of the techniques required to implement these services in a scalable, secure manner. We report on a large-scale prototyping effort that has yielded some insights into these issues. Building on the hardware base provided by the I-WAY, a national-scale Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, we developed an integrated management and application programming system, called I-Soft. This system was deployed at most of the 17 I-WAY sites and used by many of the 60 applications demonstrated on the I-WAY network. In this article, we describe the I-Soft design and report on lessons learned from application experiments.

These devices were located at 17 different sites across North America.

Reference-contexts: However, little work has been done to integrate these solutions in a way that satisfies the scalability, performance, functionality, reliability, and security requirements of realistic high-performance distributed applications in large-scale internetworks. It is in this context that the I-WAY project <ref> [6] </ref> was conceived in early 1995, with the goal of providing a large-scale testbed in which innovative high-performance and geographically-distributed applications could be deployed. <p> As a result of a competitive proposal process in early 1995, around 70 application groups were selected to run on the I-WAY (over 60 were demonstrated at SC'95). These applications fell into three general classes <ref> [6] </ref>: 1. Many applications coupled immersive virtual environments with remote supercomputers, data systems, and/or scientific instruments.

Reference-contexts: Nexus could then use this information when creating a user computation. (Nexus support for multithreading should, in principle, also be useful|for latency hiding|although in practice it was not used for that purpose during the I-WAY experiment.) Several other libraries, notably the CAVEcomm virtual reality library <ref> [7] </ref> and the MPICH implementation of MPI, were extended to use Nexus mechanisms [9]. Since MPICH is defined in terms of an "abstract point-to-point communication device," an implementation of this device in terms of Nexus mechanisms was not difficult.

Reference-contexts: Previous gigabit testbed experiments focused on network technologies and low-level protocol issues, using either synthetic network loads or specialized applications for experiments (e.g., see <ref> [8] </ref>). The I-WAY, in contrast, was driven primarily by the requirements of a large application suite. As a result of a competitive proposal process in early 1995, around 70 application groups were selected to run on the I-WAY (over 60 were demonstrated at SC'95). <p> The most closely related development is that of the ACTS ATM Internetwork (AAI) network testbed group: they deployed fast workstations at each site in a Gigabit testbed, to support network throughput experiments <ref> [8] </ref>. 5 Scheduler I-WAY-like systems require the ability to locate computational resources matching various criteria in a heterogeneous, geographically distributed pool.

To support the needs of users desiring a higher-level programming model, we adapted the Nexus mul-tithreaded communication library <ref> [10] </ref> to execute in an I-WAY environment. Nexus supports automatic configuration mechanisms that allow it to use information contained in resource databases to determine which startup mechanisms, network interfaces, and protocols to use in different situations.

In particular, Prospero's "system manager" and "node manager" processes have some similarities to our central and local managers. <p> However, both DCE and CORBA appear to have significant deficiencies as a basis for application programming in I-WAY-like systems. In particular, the remote procedure call is not well-suited to applications in which performance requirements demand asynchronous communication, multiple outstanding requests, and/or efficient collective operations. The Legion project <ref> [13] </ref> is another project developing software technology to support computing in wide-area environments. Issues addressed by this wide-reaching effort include scheduling, file systems, security, fault tolerance, and network protocols.

This software was maintained at a central site (via AFS) and could be installed easily on each I-POP; furthermore, the use of Tripwire meant that it was straightforward to detect changes to the base configuration.

Reference-contexts: Root rsh is an unacceptable long-term solution even when the I-POP is totally trusted, because of the possibility of IP-spoofing attacks. We can protect against these attacks by using a remote shell function that uses authentication (for example, one based on Kerberos <ref> [20] </ref> or PGP, either directly or via DCE). For similar reasons, communications between the scheduling daemons should also be authenticated. A more fundamental limitation of the I-WAY authentication scheme as implemented was that each user had to have an account at each site to which access was required.
