Reference-contexts: Ullman suggests that the problem of computing the optimal feasible solution can be solved by a gradient search method due to Arrow and Hurwicz <ref> [1] </ref>. The 153 gradient search locates a saddle point in a Lagrangian constructed according to the theory of Lagrange multipliers. <p> Understanding total unimodularity will allow us to gauge the feasibility of reformulating the figural completion problem as a set of more tractable linear programming problems (i.e. LP's), which can be solved by the method of Arrow and Hurwicz <ref> [1] </ref> (following the suggestion of Ullman [58]).

Reference-contexts: Although, the central portion of the upper and lower displays is the same, identical elements in different contexts play markedly different roles. In particular, the figure-ground sense of the contour marked with the arrow is opposite in the two different contexts. 5.5 Network Computation Ballard <ref> [2] </ref> considered the structure of networks which might compute the mapping function and identified two fundamental types. The first are networks consisting of independent processing elements with global spatial support.

Reference-contexts: The image irradiance equation relates the brightness of an image point to the depth, surface orientation, reflectance and illumination of 6 a visible surface point in the environment. In theory, a solution of the image irradi-ance equation would consist of a set of what Barrow and Tenenbaum <ref> [3] </ref> call intrinsic images, each of which represents one of the physical parameters underlying image brightness. The intrinsic images representing depth and surface orientation together form what Marr [38] called the 2 1 2 -D sketch.

Reference-contexts: Stated differently, what forms of completion are native to the 2 1 2 -D sketch? Marr [38] was curiously contradictory on this point. While suggesting that "continuation" (i.e. completion) processes operate within the 2 1 2 -D sketch, and even sug 5 In a recent article, Barrow and Tenenbaum <ref> [4] </ref> confirm this. They state that "Our interest in recovering scene characteristics arose in part through a belief that it was not possible to segment an image reliably into meaningful regions and boundaries on the basis of raw brightness...

Reference-contexts: Marr [38] proposed that one-dimensional discontinuities in surface orientation and depth are explicitly represented in the 2 1 2 -D sketch. Recently, Blake and Zisserman <ref> [5] </ref> have developed a method by which these discontinuities can be identified during reconstruction, so that smoothness assumptions have appropriate scope. But this addition does not change the fundamental assumption about the visual mapping (i.e. that it is a homeomorphism).

Reference-contexts: Instead, our intention is to validate the computational theory by demonstrating that a well defined procedure for computing the mapping does in fact exist. 1 To simplify implementation of the experimental system, "off-the-shelf" components were used wherever possible. For example, the straight-line grouping algorithm developed by Boldt <ref> [6] </ref> was used to generate the input set of boundary fragments. Consequently, the experimental system was tested with straight-sided figures. <p> Indeed, descriptions at this level are not properly part of a computational theory. However, they are important for understanding its implementation in the experimental system. 4.3.1 Boundary Fragments The straight line segments which serve as input to the experimental system are produced by Boldt's zero crossing grouping algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. This algorithm is quite elegant and definitely worth studying, if only because its recursive formulation addresses the difficult problem of multiple spatial scales in an intelligent manner.

Reference-contexts: The existence of a visual world, distinct from the "real world," but "going beyond" that which is plainly visible is familiar to philosophers of human perception. See Gibson <ref> [13] </ref> or Kanizsa [29] for especially lucid accounts. The field of computer vision, in contrast, has for all practical purposes ignored the problem of visual reconstruction of environmental structure that is not in plain sight.

Reference-contexts: Hubel and Wiesel conjectured that these neurons are feature detectors which respond to edges and bars (depending on their symmetry) of different orientations. More recently, it has been hypothesized that figural completion phenomena are the result of integrating simple cell responses over extended spatial areas (see for example <ref> [15] </ref>). A possible explanation for the qualitatively different completion effects in contrast and outline stimuli is that the output of cortical simple cells with odd and even receptive fields are integrated separately and in different ways. <p> Elsewhere, fragments 6 The use of the contrast sign constraint in the experimental system is a simple expedient to control the number of potential completions and is not consistent with human vision.

Reference-contexts: A typical example is a network which detects straight lines by computing a global Hough transform [24], where the components of the percept vector represent individual straight lines parameterized by their orientation and distance from the origin. In a recent paper, Guy and Medioni <ref> [16] </ref> describe an abstract transform for computing a tangent field representing global image structure from local tangent measurements. Like the Hough transform, the key to their approach is the local summation 151 of a set of global voting patterns.

Reference-contexts: Finally, 5 This is done without regard to the sign of contrast, so that no distinction is made between positive curvature maxima and negative curvature minima. Although Hoffman and Richards <ref> [20] </ref> propose that silhouettes are divided into parts at negative minima of curvature, we observe that this does not correctly predict part decomposition in illusory contour figures like the Kanizsa triangle. <p> If a column has two entries of the same sign, their rows are in different sets; 2.

Reference-contexts: The unit surface normal of an image point is then given by the equation: ^n = p The methods proposed for computing the 2 1 2 -D sketch are generally referred to as "shape-from" methods. The inspiration for these methods is the influential early work of Horn <ref> [21] </ref> on shape-from shading. Surface orientation can be computed directly from image brightness when the direction of illumination is known and surface reflectance is predominantly diffuse. Where these assumptions do not hold, alternative shape-from methods are potentially applicable.

Reference-contexts: According to Ullman, from the family of possible curves of this form, the pair of circular arcs which minimizes total bending energy (i.e. E = R (s) 2 ds, where is curvature) models the shape of the illusory contour. Horn <ref> [22] </ref> subsequently proposed that the shape of the contour joining two boundary fragments is described by the true curve of least energy, to which Ullman's curve is a two arc approximation.

Reference-contexts: However, because interconnectiv-ity requirements are so severe, their application is limited in practice to mappings between low dimensional parameter spaces. A typical example is a network which detects straight lines by computing a global Hough transform <ref> [24] </ref>, where the components of the percept vector represent individual straight lines parameterized by their orientation and distance from the origin. In a recent paper, Guy and Medioni [16] describe an abstract transform for computing a tangent field representing global image structure from local tangent measurements.

Reference-contexts: Finally, Figure 3.14 (e) and Figure 3.14 (f) demonstrate that figural completion does play a role in the organization of outline stimuli, but seems to governed by different logic depending on whether contrast or outline stimuli are involved. It has been known since Hubel and Wiesel <ref> [25] </ref> that simple cells in the human visual cortex have oriented receptive fields of either odd or even symmetry. Hubel and Wiesel conjectured that these neurons are feature detectors which respond to edges and bars (depending on their symmetry) of different orientations.

Reference-contexts: Figures 2.1- 2.3) suggests that the representation computed by the figural completion process is more general than (and probably subsumes) the labeled knot-diagrams developed here. Towards this end, it is worth re-examining Huffman's <ref> [26] </ref> influential paper "Impossible Objects as Nonsense Sentences." While this paper is widely cited as one source of the Huffman-Clowes junction catalog for trihedral scenes, the last few pages are actually devoted to a labeling scheme for line-drawings of smooth surfaces.

Reference-contexts: For example, Parent and Zucker [41] describe a network method for computing a discrete tangent and curvature field consistent with local orientation and curvature measurements produced by operators analogous to simple cells in the visual cortex.

Reference-contexts: To make matters worse, the combinatorial problem is often aggravated by extraneous contours originating in background clutter and contours which are absent because of occlusion. It is the opinion of Lowe [37] and Jacobs <ref> [28] </ref> that the necessary computational savings can only be achieved if grouping processes are used to collect together subsets of contours likely to belong to the same object prior to matching. Kanizsa's cube demonstration is very telling in this respect. <p> As part of a study of the reduction of search made possible by prior grouping in visual object recognition, Jacobs <ref> [28] </ref> computed the probability density of the size of boundary gaps due to occlusion in random juxtapositions of a set of flat polygonal surfaces. 4 Jacobs concluded that small gaps predominate and that incident frequency rapidly drops off with increasing size.
Reference: [29] <author> Kanizsa, G., </author> <title> Organization in Vision, Praeger, </title> <address> New York, </address> <year> 1979. </year>
Reference-contexts: The existence of a visual world, distinct from the "real world," but "going beyond" that which is plainly visible is familiar to philosophers of human perception. See Gibson [13] or Kanizsa <ref> [29] </ref> for especially lucid accounts. The field of computer vision, in contrast, has for all practical purposes ignored the problem of visual reconstruction of environmental structure that is not in plain sight. <p> These are two examples of perceptual completion, a collective term for those phenomena which "fill in" our experience of the visual world. Examples of perceptual completion abound, and include the well known phenomena of illusory contours 2 which are epitomized by displays such as the Kanizsa triangle <ref> [29] </ref> (Figure 1.4). In Kanizsa's figure, a white triangle appears to partially occlude three black discs and a second triangle rendered in outline. Although the completion of the black discs is perceived, this perception is not manifest as a brightness change. <p> of the appeal of the standard model is that it allows some aspects of the visual reconstruction problem to be studied without first having to solve the more difficult problem of deducing the topology of environmental structure. 5 Although the phenomenological evidence for perceptual completion in human vision is unassailable <ref> [29] </ref>, one might argue that certain forms of interpolation go beyond what is reasonable to represent and compute in a viewer-centered representation. 6 Certainly, the phrase "perceptual completion" could be used to describe the process by which an object-centered, three-dimensional representation of surfaces is derived from the 2 1 2 -D <p> Although, each organization contains the same set of closed boundaries, individual boundaries differ in sign of occlusion and/or relative depth. 66 (c) (d) square (redrawn from Kanizsa <ref> [29] </ref>). <p> These include the position, orientation and curvature of the boundary fragments which the completion joins. Although few in number, the interplay of these factors can be quite subtle. Consider Figure 3.5 (redrawn from Kanizsa <ref> [29] </ref>), which illustrates the amodal completion of a partially occluded circle and square. In both cases, completion is accomplished in a manner which preserves tangent and curvature continuity at the terminal ends of the occluded boundaries. <p> The human visual system seems unwilling to accept the spatial coincidence inherent in the superposition of a tangent and curvature discontinuity and a point belonging to a second boundary. Significant for not being a factor is symmetry. Consider Figure 3.6 (also redrawn from Kanizsa <ref> [29] </ref>). Figure 3.6 (b) depicts the shape of the completion reported by test subjects when presented with the stimulus depicted in Figure 3.6 (a). Kanizsa maintains that the shape depicted in Figure 3.6 (c) can be imagined, but is not preattentively perceived. <p> As it currently stands, this analysis is incomplete, since it does not adequately account for the phenomenon of illusory contours and the difference in human perception of contrast and outline stimuli <ref> [29] </ref>. Compare Figure 3.14 (a), in which an 92 illusory triangle is readily perceived, to Figure 3.14 (c). Although the closed contours in Figure 3.14 (c) correspond to the boundaries of the black regions in Figure 3.14 (a), they do not trigger the percept of an illusory triangle. <p> Although this may represent an explanation at the "implementation level" it clearly begs the question of "why it should be so." Kanizsa <ref> [29] </ref> attributed the discrepancy to the (apparent) "incompleteness" of elements in the contrast stimulus (e.g. discs with missing sectors) and the "completeness" of the same elements in the outline stimulus (e.g. closed contours). <p> Even so, there is a strong tendency to see the broader of the two surfaces in front of the narrower (i.e. the longer completion is perceived amodally). A dramatic example of the Petter effect, designed by Kanizsa <ref> [29] </ref>, is shown in Figure 3.16. The striking thing about this figure is that even though an interpretation as two surfaces embedded in planes at constant depth is absolutely plausible, given the image evidence, it is not perceived. <p> The average reduction in the total number of floating point multiplies, for the same five instances is 97 percent. 5.4 Context Dependency of Figural Completion Although the philosophy of the Gestalt psychologists is supposedly captured by the sentence "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts," Kanizsa <ref> [29] </ref> points out that this statement is actually somewhat of a misrepresentation. Gestalt philosophy, in small part, was an early 20th century attempt to describe a set of phenomena in human vision using metaphors from physics [34, 35]. <p> In particular, the figure-ground sense of the contour marked with the arrow is opposite in the two different contexts. This demonstration was designed by Kanizsa <ref> [29] </ref>. 149 (b) p p transform. (b) A relaxation network. 150 One of the connotations of the word "Gestalt" is irreducible whole. <p> Ullman [58] called a device for computing such a non-decomposable function a "Gestaltron." The fact that the computation underlying illusory contours possesses this property is dramatically illustrated in Figure 5.7, a demonstration designed by Kanizsa <ref> [29] </ref>. Although, the central portion of the upper and lower displays is the same, identical elements in different contexts play markedly different roles.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it seems quite contrived. This suggests that while the shape and location of completions can determine topological aspects of the organization (i.e. unit and depth), topological aspects do not determine completion shape. A still more radical notion is advanced by Kellman and Loukides <ref> [32] </ref>, who theorize that "unit formation" occurs prior to and independently of "depth placement." This possibility will be considered in detail in Chapter 5. 3.3.1 Curves of Least Energy Even if we assume that completion shape is solely a function of the position, orientation and curvature of the boundary fragments which <p> The unit/depth organization model, shown in (c), requires the additional assumption that unit ambiguity can be resolved in advance and independently of depth ambiguity. 135 independently of depth organization (see Figures 5.2 and 5.3). This lends support to the conjecture of Kellman and Loukides <ref> [32] </ref> mentioned in Chapter 3. Second, the integer linear program for the unit organization sub-problem is shown to possess a property called total unimodularity, which allows it to be solved by numerical relaxation in a locally connected network. <p> This was made possible by assuming that completion shape is determined solely by the tangents and curvatures of the terminal ends of the occluded boundaries and not by a completion's role in any eventual surface organization. A still more radical notion is proposed by Kellman and Loukides <ref> [32] </ref>, who argue that unit organization is accomplished in advance and independently of depth organization. More specifically, they propose that visible contour fragments are organized into closed plane curves before their relative depths at points of intersection are determined. <p> This leads to the prediction that completions joining pairs of boundary fragments sharing these attributes will always be of the same shape. 162 * Finally, in Chapter 5, we considered the hypothesis of Kellman and Loukides <ref> [32] </ref> that unit ambiguity is resolved independently and in advance of depth ambiguity. This leads to the prediction (partially confirmed) that topologically invalid unit organizations exist.

Reference-contexts: Visual recognition (in this more limited sense) is often understood to mean correspondence between components of a stored geometric model and contours in an image, together with knowledge of the object's pose, or spatial orientation relative to the camera <ref> [47, 37] </ref>. <p> To make matters worse, the combinatorial problem is often aggravated by extraneous contours originating in background clutter and contours which are absent because of occlusion. It is the opinion of Lowe <ref> [37] </ref> and Jacobs [28] that the necessary computational savings can only be achieved if grouping processes are used to collect together subsets of contours likely to belong to the same object prior to matching. Kanizsa's cube demonstration is very telling in this respect. <p> to accept two or more elements as part of a larger entity is to accept that continuity as the result of coincidental placement in space of these elements, that is, of elements that have no intrinsic relationship to one another." A similiar concept of "non-accidentalness" has been emphasized by Lowe <ref> [37] </ref>. By instantiating a completion, we are accounting for its coincidence of shape (i.e. we are attributing the origin of the two boundary fragments it joins to a single physical process). If a completion is not instantiated, we are asserting that the two fragments 91 originate in independent physical processes.

Reference-contexts: The standard model is the now familiar theory that the purpose of early human visual processing is to compute a viewer-centered representation of visible surfaces which is most often called the 2 1 2 -D sketch <ref> [38] </ref>. However, the position taken in this thesis is that by considering only the visible surfaces, the standard model fails to address the most difficult part of the visual reconstruction problem, which is deducing the topology of three-dimensional scene structure. <p> In theory, a solution of the image irradi-ance equation would consist of a set of what Barrow and Tenenbaum [3] call intrinsic images, each of which represents one of the physical parameters underlying image brightness. The intrinsic images representing depth and surface orientation together form what Marr <ref> [38] </ref> called the 2 1 2 -D sketch. <p> Marr <ref> [38] </ref> proposed that one-dimensional discontinuities in surface orientation and depth are explicitly represented in the 2 1 2 -D sketch.

Stated differently, what forms of completion are native to the 2 1 2 -D sketch? Marr <ref> [38] </ref> was curiously contradictory on this point. While suggesting that "continuation" (i.e. completion) processes operate within the 2 1 2 -D sketch, and even sug 5 In a recent article, Barrow and Tenenbaum [4] confirm this. <p> This methodology is based upon Marr's <ref> [38] </ref> belief that complex information processing systems can only be understood by analyzing them at the three levels of 1) computational theory; 2) algorithm and representation; and 3) implementation. <p> Chapter 4 describes an experimental implementation of the computational theory outlined in Chapter 2 and 3.

Reference-contexts: Because this was discussed in detail in the previous chapter, we consider the second source of constraints, which will be termed the stimulus conformity requirement. The importance of this requirement has been stressed by Irvin Rock <ref> [48] </ref>, who observed that "the [perceptual] solution must not contradict the stimulus" and "must contain everything implied by the stimulus." Regarding illusory contour displays, Rock hypothesized that the depth of visible boundaries must be zero, and that light surfaces must be visible against dark surfaces and vice versa. <p> The word "unit" is used here in the manner it is used by the Gestalt psychologists (see for example Schumann [54]), and in this thesis refers to the boundary components which are the products of the grouping process. Unit ambiguity is illustrated in Figure 3.3. Rock <ref> [48] </ref> calls the interpretation in Figure 3.3 (b) the "literal solution." Both the literal solution and the solution depicted in Figure 3.3 (c) are topologically valid and conform to the image evidence. <p> Also important, if a completion is instantiated, and its boundary depth equals zero (indicating that it should be visible) then the absence of a corresponding luminance boundary should be explainable. In Rock's <ref> [48] </ref> words "the [perceptual] solution must not contradict the stimulus." Consider contour j which joins visible boundary fragments i and k (possibly through an arbitrary number of additional edges and crossings; see Figure 3.12). <p> In a similiar manner, we can compute ' i , ' 0 i , ' k and ' 0 k associated with surfaces S i , S 0 i , S k and S 0 Following Rock <ref> [48] </ref>, we hypothesize that illusory contours occur only in those situations where the missing section of surface boundary presumably projects to the 86 image plane with little or no brightness change. <p> The surprise at not seeing x is infinite when P r (x) = 1 and zero when P r (x) = 0. The surprise metaphor appears frequently in theories of grouping. For example, Rock <ref> [48] </ref> suggests that: "The perceptual system detects continuity of direction among contours. <p> If the goal is to compute a unique organization, then additional preference criteria must be employed. Additional preference criteria are described by Rock <ref> [48] </ref> who demonstrates the role they play with numerous examples. First among these is the correlation between the sign of occlusion and the sign of contrast. The effect of this preference in human vision is that against a white background, there is a strong tendency to perceive 97 black figure.

Reference-contexts: Although no comprehensive theory exists, computational models have been proposed for the shape of illusory contours joining boundary fragments with orientation difference significantly less than 2 . Ullman <ref> [57] </ref> originally hypothesized that the curve used by the human visual system to join two contour fragments is constructed from two circular arcs. <p> However, there is no physical basis for this assumption and there is abundant evidence (e.g. Figure 1.10) that the human visual system does not use it. 72 then the question of why it does so remains.

Smoothness and isotropy imply tangent continuity and rotational invariance, which are clearly desirable properties and in accordance with observation.

Reference-contexts: We observe that objective function Q unit simultaneously maximizes likelihood and minimizes surprise. Consequently, variable weights range from negative infinity to positive infinity. In comparison, the log-likelihood weighting function which Ullman <ref> [58] </ref> proposed for the correspondence problem in apparent motion uses exclusively negative weights (i.e. log-likelihoods). <p> Using the language developed in the previous paragraph, we might say that many Gestalt demonstrations strongly suggest that the function mapping the stimulus to the percept can not be decomposed into independent functions computable with local spatial support. Ullman <ref> [58] </ref> called a device for computing such a non-decomposable function a "Gestaltron." The fact that the computation underlying illusory contours possesses this property is dramatically illustrated in Figure 5.7, a demonstration designed by Kanizsa [29]. <p> Although Guy and Medioni never explicitly formulate an optimization problem, and although their method of computation is very different from relaxation, their choice of computational goal and their use of the co-circularity constraint is very much in the spirit of the earlier work of Parent and Zucker [41]. 152 Ullman's <ref> [58] </ref> minimal mapping theory of the correspondence problem in apparent motion is a second example of a global optimization problem solved by a locally connected network of processing elements. <p> Understanding total unimodularity will allow us to gauge the feasibility of reformulating the figural completion problem as a set of more tractable linear programming problems (i.e. LP's), which can be solved by the method of Arrow and Hurwicz [1] (following the suggestion of Ullman <ref> [58] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In this respect, this thesis goes quite a bit beyond what computer vision typically regards to be the purpose of perceptual organization: Grouping of image measurements of one kind or another into collections likely to belong to individual objects. Ten years ago Witkin and Tenenbaum <ref> [60] </ref> wrote what many consider to be a kind of "P.O." manifesto. In "On the Role of Structure in Vision" they argued that the purpose of perceptual organization is to provide an explicit representation of "primitive image structure" embodying geometric coincidence which "demands explanation" from higher-level cognitive processes. <p> Because the problem is underconstrained, it is proposed that the human visual system resolves the ambiguity in computing a unique completion shape in a way that affords inferential leverage <ref> [60] </ref> in resolving the other two ambiguities. Under this assumption, the problem of computing a labeled knot diagram is shown to be a graph labeling problem, which is posed as an integer linear program. Chapter 4 describes an experimental implementation of the computational theory outlined in Chapter 2 and 3. <p> Is there an additional, computational theory level rationale? Witkin and Tenenbaum <ref> [60] </ref> examine this question at length and reject those commonly cited. They point out that Occam's razor provides no philosophical justification for "smooth as possible" solutions in computer vision since the definition of smooth (or simple) inevitably depends on the choice of representation. <p> We hypothesize that the human visual system resolves the ambiguity in completion shape somewhat arbitrarily, but in doing so, it gains information useful for resolving the unit ambiguity. Witkin and Tenenbaum <ref> [60] </ref> argue that perceptually significant geometric relations like collinearity and parallelism are actually the zero distortion limiting cases of more general "fuzzy identity" measures. 3 The measures are defined to be the total energy in least-distortion transformations mapping one token's position into another's. <p> Whether or not this is actually feasible is another matter. It is Witkin and Tenenbaum's <ref> [60] </ref> opinion that identifying the precise functional form of the probability densities underlying perceptual organization is unrealistic given the complexity of the real world.
