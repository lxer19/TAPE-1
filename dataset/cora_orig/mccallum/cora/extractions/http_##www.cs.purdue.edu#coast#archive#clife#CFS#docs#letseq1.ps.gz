Reference-contexts: LETSEQ1 is implemented using CFS-C, a package of subroutines which implement a learning classifier system. For a complete description of the CFS-C classifier system, see <ref> [Riolo, 1988a] </ref>. In particular, before using the LETSEQ1 program, a user should be familiar with Section 2, "Classifier Systems," and Section 3, "The CFS-C Classifier System," of that document. Those sections give a detailed description of all the important characteristics and features of the CFS-C major-cycle, including: 1. <p> For a complete description of these and other CFS-C commands, see "Appendix A, The CFS-C System Commands" in <ref> [Riolo, 1988a] </ref>.
