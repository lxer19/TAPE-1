Abstract: The procedure for linear programming in linear time in fixed dimension is extended to solve in linear time certain nonlinear problems. Examples are the problem of finding the smallest ball enclosing n given balls, and the weighted center problem in fixed dimension.

Reference-contexts: In the same paper Dyer also improves the search technique itself obtaining better constants in the linear functions. An analogous improvement was proposed by Clarkson <ref> [Cl] </ref>. Dyer's trick was to reformulate the problem as a linear optimization problem with linear inequalities plus only one quadratic inequality. In this note we consider the problem of the smallest ball enclosing n given balls, where it seems that such a trick does not work. <p> As in the linear programming algorithm in fixed dimension, the search technique lets us discard in linear time a fixed fraction of the constraints and hence the entire procedure runs in linear time in any fixed dimension. Using the improvements proposed by Dyer [D2] and Clarkson <ref> [Cl] </ref>, the coefficient of the linear function varies with the dimension like O (3 d 2 3. The weighted center problem The weighted center problem can be solved using an idea similar to the one presented in section 2.

An oracle is an algorithm that decides the position of this point relative to any given hyperplane H. As pointed out in <ref> [M2] </ref>, when the objective function is convex, one can use as an oracle an algorithm that solves the optimization problem with an additional requirement that the point lie on H; then, another optimization problem over the neighborhood of the constrained optimum reveals the "correct" side of H. 4 In our case
