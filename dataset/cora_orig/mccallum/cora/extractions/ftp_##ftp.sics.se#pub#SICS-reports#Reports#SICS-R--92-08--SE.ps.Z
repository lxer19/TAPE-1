Abstract: The theory of partial inductive definitions is a mathematical formalism which has proved to be useful in a number of different applications. The fundamentals of the theory is shortly described. Partial inductive definitions and their associated calculi are essentially infinitary. To implement them on a computer, they must be given a formal finitary representation. We present such a finitary representation, and prove its soundness. The finitary representation is given in a form with and without variables. Without variables, derivations are unchanging entities. With variables, derivations can contain logical variables that can become bound by a binding environment that is extended as the derivation is constructed. The variant with variables is essentially a generalization of the pure GCLA programming language. The author wishes to thank his colleagues at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science for their suggestions and for providing a stimulating research environment. In particular, I want to thank the people of the GCLA project for provoking me to develop many of the results presented here, as well as Philipp Hanschke (of DFKI, Kaiserslautern) who read a draft version of the article and suggested several improvements. *) Also published in: Lars-Henrik Eriksson, Lars Hallns and Peter Schroeder-Heister (eds.), ELP '91, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Extensions of Logic Programming held at SICS, Stockholm, Sweden, January 1991, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, Springer-Verlag, 1992.
