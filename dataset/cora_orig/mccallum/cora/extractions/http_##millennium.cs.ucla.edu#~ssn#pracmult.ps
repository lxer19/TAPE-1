Abstract: LAN multicast is now an essential service for users of the MBone and other IP multicast tools. Traditional IP multicast has travelled over two types of subnetwork: point-to-point links and subnetworks with inherent multicast capability, such as Ethernet and token ring. More recent LANs may be arbitrary mesh networks with no built-in, efficient, multicast capability. The authors describe a successful implementation of multicasting over a 640 Mbit/s, wormhole-routing LAN. The implementation is integrated with the wider-area multicast IP service. Consideration is given to practical issues such as interoperation with existing multicast routing protocols and software, and multicast-group setup latencies.

Reference-contexts: The MBone in particular is used by workers in networking and nonnetworking fields as part of their productivity. IP multicast can be used in support of digital virtual environments (DVEs) to reduce the load on the Internet as compared with conventional unicast methods <ref> [1] </ref>. More local multicast services are also used in support of distributed computations. For these applications low latency is often of paramount importance. For internet multicasting several routing protocols have been created to allow multicast packet forwarding amongst several subnetworks.

Reference-contexts: Future high-speed LANs cannot be expected to provide automatic multicast in the same way. For example, local-area ATM, and wormhole-routing networks such as Myrinet (described later), have a point-to-point mesh physical topology. Even giga-Ethernet <ref> [2] </ref> may move towards such a topology because of the reduced collision radius. Inherent multicast may not be taken for granted in such environments. To achieve transparent multicast over such subnetworks we have interposed a sublayer above the subnetwork but below multicast IP to provide control of multicasting.

Reference-contexts: This cooperates with the Internet gateway management protocol (IGMP) to dynamically control multicast groups. 1 2 Myrinet Myrinet is a commercial wormhole-routing, high-speed (640 Mb/s) electronic LAN <ref> [3] </ref>. The switches are crossbar interconnects. The links have a maximum length of 25 metres. The host interfaces for this network consist of peripheral bus cards containing their own processor, the LANai.

Reference-contexts: Myrinet uses a few control symbols such as stop, go (for backpressure) and fres (for resetting the network). Myrinet employs wormhole routing, backpressure flow control and source routing to achieve low-latency transfer of variable-sized messages | called worms | in the local area network environment. In wormhole routing <ref> [4] </ref>, the unit of information transfer is a worm. A worm can range in length from a few bytes to several thousand bytes. In Myrinet, the maximum worm size is 9 Kbytes (this is a limit imposed by the LANai's control program).

Reference-contexts: Such a flow-control scheme on an arbitrary mesh is prone to deadlock, so a restricted form of routing (up/down routing <ref> [5] </ref>) is employed. 2.1 Myrinet broadcasting Myrinet provides no physical support for multicasting or broadcasting. Multicasting is difficult to perform over a wormhole-routing network due to the problems inherent in performing flow control over a multicast tree, and the increased likelihood of deadlock.

Reference-contexts: wasteful of both network link resources in sending to unwanted hosts and of host resources in filtering of unwanted packets. 3 Wormhole multicasting In order to provide a multicast service using an inherently nonbroadcast physical subnetwork (such as a wormhole-routing network), the authors have already investigated a number of schemes <ref> [6] </ref>. The proposed schemes involve the multiple forwarding of a single multicast packet amongst several hosts on the same subnetwork. The two major variants that have been investigated are forwarding around a cycle of hosts and forwarding down a binary tree of hosts. <p> The received multicast packets will be dropped by the kernel with the IP layer. 6 routing daemon and cd is the cycle-control daemon The hosts of the cycle are arranged in order of ascending host ID number. As discussed in detail in our previous paper <ref> [6] </ref>, in order to achieve reliable, deadlock-free delivery it is necessary to impose a total ordering on all multicast hosts. <p> This is compared to a typical multicast group lifespan of several minutes. This delay will be insignificant, for example, in the case of the multimedia MBone tools. Once a multicast cycle has been established the maximum achievable throughputs are as previously reported <ref> [6] </ref>, viz. greater than 120 Mbit/s for a single sender and large packet sizes.

Reference-contexts: A host that wishes to join a multicast group sends a `join group' message as a local multicast on the group it wishes to join. This message is part of the Internet group management protocol (IGMP) <ref> [7] </ref>, and informs any multicast routers attached to the same local subnet that the host will be sending and receiving multicast IP packets on that particular address. Hosts leave multicast groups in a passive way. Multicast routers periodically send inquiries concerning group membership on their locally attached subnets. <p> IP multicast packets that are not destined for an application at that host will be filtered out by the kernel. It should be noted that this approach is similar to that taken by the standard for mapping IP multicast addresses to Ethernet multicast addresses <ref> [7] </ref>.
