Title: Quantifying the Value of Constructive Induction, Knowledge, and Noise Filtering on Inductive Learning  
Keyword: Topic Experimental studies of constructive induction systems  
Abstract: Learning research, as one of its central goals, tries to measure, model, and understand how learning-problem properties effect average-case learning performance. For example, we would like to quantify the value of constructive construction, noise filtering, and background knowledge. This paper describes the effective dimension, a new learning measure that helps link problem properties to learning performance. Like the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension, the effective dimension is often in a simple linear relation with problem properties. Unlike the VC dimension, the effective dimension can be estimated empirically and makes average-case predictions. It is therefore more widely applicable to machine and human learning research. The measure is demonstrated on several learning systems including Backpropagation. Finally, the measure is used precisely predict the benefit of using FRINGE, a feature construction system. The benefit is found to decrease as the complexity of the target concept increases.

Reference-contexts: Suppose the parameter of interest is the number of example attributes. The learning-measure function, in this case, is [Blumer et al., 1987]. The measure-to speed relation is fixed. It is where is the learning measure, is the number of examples, is the accuracy, and is a confidence parameter <ref> [Anthony et al., 1990] </ref>. In general, a learning measure should condense a learning curve into a single number. As figure 3 shows, the VC dimension accomplishes this. A learning measure should also be unique and universal so that measurements made at different times or by different researchers can be compared.
