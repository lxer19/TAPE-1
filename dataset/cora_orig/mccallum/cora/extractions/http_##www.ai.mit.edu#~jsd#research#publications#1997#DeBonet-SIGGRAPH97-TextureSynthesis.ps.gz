Title: Multiresolution Sampling Procedure for Analysis and Synthesis of Texture Images

Abstract: This paper outlines a technique for treating input texture images as probability density estimators from which new textures, with similar appearance and structural properties, can be sampled. In a two-phase process, the input texture is first analyzed by measuring the joint occurrence of texture discrimination features at multiple resolutions. In the second phase, a new texture is synthesized by sampling successive spatial frequency bands from the input texture, conditioned on the similar joint occurrence of features at lower spatial frequencies. Textures synthesized with this method more successfully capture the characteristics of input textures than do previous techniques.

Reference-contexts: For texture synthesis purposes however, a poor approximation such as direct correlation, is sufficient. The difficulty of determining a function D, to approximate D fl depends on the structure and textual complexity of the two images. Many psychophysically based approximations have been proposed (e.g. <ref> [4, 6] </ref>.) Clearly, more complex textures can be represented in larger images; therefore, determining a discrimination function, say D small , between images which have few pixels is less difficult than determining a similar function D large over larger images.

Reference-contexts: The success of these methods is dependent upon the structure of the probability density estimator used in the sampling procedure. Recently several attempts at developing such estimators have been successful in limited domains. Most notably Heeger and Bergen <ref> [10] </ref> iteratively resample random noise to coerce it into having particular multireso-lution oriented energy histograms. Using a similar distribution, and a more rigorous resampling method Zhu and Mumford [16] have also achieved some success.
