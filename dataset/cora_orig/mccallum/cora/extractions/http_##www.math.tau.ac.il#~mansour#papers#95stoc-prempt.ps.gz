Abstract: Bandwidth allocation is a fundamental problem in the design of networks that allocate, in advance, bandwidth to connections. The problem is intensified when and acceptance/rejection decisions on connections have to be done on-line, without knowledge of future requests. We show that the ability to preempt (i.e., abort) connections in service in order to be able to schedule "more valuable" connections substantially improves the overall throughput of the network. We concentrate on the case where any single call might occupy only a constant fraction of the bandwidth. We present bandwidth allocation strategies that use preemption and show that they achieve constant competitiveness with respect to the throughput. Our results should be contrasted with recent works showing that non-preemptive strategies have at most logarithmic competitiveness.

Reference-contexts: Under the assumption that no call may request more than a logarithmic fraction of the bandwidth, they presented a strategy with logarithmic competitiveness, and proved that no on-line strategy has better performance. Randomized algorithms for non-preemptive call control on tree-like networks is given in <ref> [ABFR94] </ref>, where logarithmic competitiveness is shown with matching impossibility results. Other topologies are considered in [AGLR94] with similar results. [LT94] considered non-preemptive on-line "interval scheduling" in a model similar to our line model.

The guaranteed bandwidth policy is contrasted with the more traditional policy (e.g., INTERNET), where information packets are routed as they come to the network without prior knowledge about the connections.

Reference-contexts: ffi = 1). (2) In the line model, if we let calls have arbitrary duration, and let ffi be more than half, then constant competitiveness cannot be achieved by any deterministic algorithm. (Bounds on the competitiveness of randomized preemptive bandwidth allocation algorithms in this and related models are shown in <ref> [CI94] </ref>.) We also consider a special case of the single link model where all calls have identical bandwidth, which is 1=k of the capacity of the link for some integer k. <p> In the next section we show that if we let calls have arbitrary duration, and let ffi be more than half, then constant competitiveness cannot be achieved by any deterministic algorithm. (We note that this holds even if randomization is allowed <ref> [CI94] </ref>.) More formally, assume the stations are labeled by consecutive integers increasing from left to right. A call c is characterized by its left endpoint l c , its right endpoint r c and its bandwidth requirement b c .

Reference-contexts: They achieved slightly worse than logarithmic competitive ratio and showed that no on-line algorithm can achieve a logarithmic competitive ratio. In summary, whenever preemption is not allowed the "logarithmic barrier" seems to be unbreakable, even by randomized algorithms. We remark that <ref> [LPR94] </ref> study a related problem of managing a connectionless network (e.g. 2 TCP/IP) on a connection oriented network (e.g., X.25). Their main assumption is that the number of simultaneously open connections is limited, and their main task is to decide when and which connection to close.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, some types of connections should never be preempted (e.g., phone calls). However, there exist other scenarios where preemption is acceptable, and even essential. For instance, a high priority (say, real-time) connection should be allowed to preempt a low priority connection. (See <ref> [RVG + 93] </ref> for an implementation of a channel where this type of preemption is used.) The willingness of users to communicate over preemptable, low priority, connections would depend on the price discount they would receive, compared to a non-preemptable connection.
