Abstract: Blind separation of independent sources from their convolutive mixtures is a problem in many real world multi-sensor applications. In this paper we present a solution to this problem based on the information maximization principle, which was recently proposed by Bell and Sejnowski for the case of blind separation of instantaneous mixtures. We present a feedback network architecture capable of coping with convolutive mixtures, and we derive the adaptation equations for the adaptive filters in the network by maximizing the information transferred through the network. Examples using speech signals are presented to illustrate the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Existing algorithms can be roughly divided into two categories, those that take some aspects of higher order statistics into account implicitly through some nonlinear functions (neural network-like algorithms) [14, 3, 22, 16, 9, 2, 5], and those that do it explicitly <ref> [12, 7, 27, 1] </ref>. Also, generalized cross-correlations can be used [26, 23]. A tutorial review to methods in the first category is given in [15]. <p> Bell and Sejnowski demonstrated the efficiency of this rule in the separation of as many as ten artificially mixed audio sources. The algorithm can be made more efficient and independent of the conditioning of the mixing matrix by using the so called natural gradient instead of the absolute gradient <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 CONVOLUTIVE MIXTURES Real audio signals present one example where the instantaneous mixing assumption does not hold. The acoustic environment (like a room) imposes a different impulse response between each source and microphone pair.

IEEE workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing, Kyoto, Japan, Sept 4-6 1996 2 As pointed out in <ref> [23, 2] </ref>, there are several obstacles to applying these algorithms to real world situations. These include the effect of noise to successful learning of the separating solution, possibly unknown number of sources (especially noise sources), and the assumption that the source signals are stationary. <p> No general and rigorous solution seems to exist so far, unless the approach in [21] will turn out to be one. Bell and Sejnowski have presented an appealing approach of using mutual information as the separating criterion for instantaneous mixtures <ref> [2] </ref>. In a previous paper we extended Bell's information-theoretic approach to the separation of delayed signals [25]. In this paper will show how the problem of convolutive mixtures is also solvable using the same approach. We will first review the algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski. <p> algorithm. 2 INFORMATION MAXIMIZATION Bell and Sejnowski proposed to learn the separating matrix W by minimizing the mutual information between components of y (t) = g (u (t)), where g is a nonlinear function approximating the cumulative density function (cdf) of the sources (see Fig. 1 for a two-source network) <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The existence of a separating solution requires that the stable inverse of G (z) exists (this implies that it is possible to construct mixtures impossible to separate). This network is the combined deconvolution and separation network mentioned in <ref> [2] </ref>. The adaptation rules for the filter coefficients are easy to derive directly in the time domain, again by maximizing the entropy at the output (See Appendix A). However, entropy maximization with this network does not result in the solution of (3). <p> We have presented a feedback network architecture of adaptive filters for blind separation of such sources. We have derived adaptation equations for the filters based on the information maximization principle presented by Bell and Sejnowski <ref> [2] </ref>. Experiments with speech sources demonstrate the efficiency of the approach. Though all presented examples concern only two sources, the method is easily extendable to multiple sources as mentioned in Appendix B.

The delay to the first nonzero tap was also learned by the delay adaptation rule <ref> [25] </ref>. This way we can avoid wasting resources to taps with zero coefficients in the beginning of the filter. The learning rate for the delays needs to be larger than the learning rate for the weights to make the delays "win" first. <p> Following the steps in Appendix A and in <ref> [25] </ref> for all these cases, we get: w i0i _ (1 2y i )x i + 1=w i0i ; w ikj _ (1 2y i )u j (t k): (17) The zero delay weights scale the data to maximize the information passed through the sigmoid, other weights in the direct branches

Reference-contexts: Existing algorithms can be roughly divided into two categories, those that take some aspects of higher order statistics into account implicitly through some nonlinear functions (neural network-like algorithms) [14, 3, 22, 16, 9, 2, 5], and those that do it explicitly <ref> [12, 7, 27, 1] </ref>. Also, generalized cross-correlations can be used [26, 23]. A tutorial review to methods in the first category is given in [15]. <p> As independence can be defined in terms of vanishing higher-order cross statistics, many papers learn filters for separation by either implicitly or explicitly minimizing some function of some high-order cross statistics with a range of time lags, either combined or without using second order statistics <ref> [22, 12, 11, 27, 20, 24, 17, 28, 6] </ref>. Another approach is to return to the instantaneous mixture case by means of array processing [18], by moving to the frequency domain [4, 19], or by means of multivariate linear prediction [10, 13].

Only in <ref> [28] </ref> separation experiments done with real acoustic signals in a real reverberant environment are reported. No general and rigorous solution seems to exist so far, unless the approach in [21] will turn out to be one.
