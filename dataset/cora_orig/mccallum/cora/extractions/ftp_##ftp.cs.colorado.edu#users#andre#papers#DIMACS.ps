Abstract: The problem of finding the naturally occurring structure of a protein is believed to correspond to minimizing the free, or potential, energy of the protein. This is generally a very difficult global optimization problem, with a large number of parameters and a huge number of local minimizers including many with function values near that of the global minimizer. This paper presents a new global optimization method for such problems. The method consists of an initial phase that locates some reasonably low local minimizers of the energy function, followed by the main phase that progresses from the best current local minimizers to even lower local minimizers. The method combines portions that work on small subsets of the parameters, including small-scale global optimizations using stochastic methods, with local minimizations involving all the parameters. In computational tests on the protein polyalanine with up to 58 amino acids (116 internal parameters), the method appears to be very successful in finding the lowest energy structures. The largest case is particularly significant because the lowest energy structures that are found include ones that exhibit interesting tertiary as opposed to just secondary structure.

Reference-contexts: Chemists have developed a number of empirical potential energy functions to describe the interaction between atoms in proteins. In this study we use a version of the CHARMM energy function <ref> [1] </ref> to compute the potential energy. This function depends on the coordinates of the atoms in the protein and has the form f (x) = i;j E bond + X E angle + X E dihedral + X (E V dW + E elec )(3.1) .

Reference-contexts: In internal parameters, there are two parameters per amino acid, meaning that the problems tested have up to 116 optimization parameters. Our calculations have mainly been performed on a KSR1 multiprocessor using up to 64 processors, using a parallelization strategy similar to that described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In the problems with 20, 30, and 40 amino acids, the best structure found by our algorithm in each case is a very regular alpha-helix.

Reference-contexts: The approach was applied to potential energy functions for two different cluster problems. The first problem was that of identical atoms using the Lennard-Jones potential energy function, and the second problem involved clusters of water molecules using GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION METHODS FOR PROTEIN FOLDING PROBLEMS 3 the Coker/Watts energy function <ref> [6] </ref>. These molecular cluster problems have some of the same challenges as the protein folding problem, including many parameters, a huge number of local minimizers, and many low local minimizers. <p> Lennard-Jones problems characterize the interaction of inert gasses such as argon; more importantly, Lennard-Jones terms are a key part of many empirical energy models including all commonly used energy functions for proteins. The potential energy of water clusters that we use was developed by Coker and Watts <ref> [6] </ref>, and has also been used in global optimization research by Long [14].

Reference-contexts: Polyalanine is a simple polypeptide in that each amino acid is the same and the side chain in the amino acid is simple and contributes no additional dihedral angles to the parameterization.

Our calculations have mainly been performed on a KSR1 multiprocessor using up to 64 processors, using a parallelization strategy similar to that described in [3]. <p> The 58 residue problem is considerably more interesting. There are conflicting results in the literature regarding what shape to expect for this problem. Wilson and Cui [19] found alpha-helical structures for polyalanine with up to 80 residues using a simulated annealing method; however, Head-Gordon and Stillinger <ref> [10] </ref> show that for 58 residue polyalanine, a lower energy minimizer exists whose structure is two parallel alpha-helices connected by a turn.

Reference-contexts: A major challenge in solving large-scale global optimization problems is that there is no clean mathematical basis for efficiently reaching a global minimizer, such as an analog to steepest descent or Newton's method for local minimization. Many methods have been developed for such global optimization problems (see the survey <ref> [17] </ref>), and these therefore tend to be heuristic and often require large amounts of computation time. This is true of the method presented here as well.
