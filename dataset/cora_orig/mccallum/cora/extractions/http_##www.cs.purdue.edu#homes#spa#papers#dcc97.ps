Abstract: Preliminary Experimental Results Abstract Recently, a novel image compression technique based on pattern matching was proposed, namely Pattern Matching Image Compression (PMIC). Basically, it is a lossy extension of the well known Lempel-Ziv scheme. It was proved that such an extension leads to a suboptimal compression, and that the compression ratio can as low as the so called Renyi entropy. Success of PMIC crucially depends on several enhancements such as searching for reverse approximate matching, recognizing substrings in images that are additively shifted versions of each other, introducing a variable and adaptive maximum distortion level, and so forth. In this paper, we introduce another enhancement, namely, predictive coding. More importantly, we implement Differential Predictive Code Modulation (DPCM) within PMIC scheme. We report here some preliminary experimental results which show that PMIC enhanced by prediction can improve compression ratio for good quality images as well as speed of compression for PMIC. fl This work was supported by NSF Grants NCR-9415491 and CCR-9201078.

Reference-contexts: Using this theoretical underpinning, Atallah, Genin and Szpankowski <ref> [2] </ref> have recently implemented for image compression the above idea enhanced by some salient features discussed below. <p> This novel scheme is called Pattern Matching Image Compression (PMIC), and it is briefly review in the next section (see also [4] for another implementation of a lossy Lempel-Ziv'78 scheme, however, in [4] there is no theoretical justifications for the reported results). In <ref> [2] </ref> it was concluded that for images of good quality PMIC scheme is competitive to JPEG and wavelet image compression. <p> This is in contrast with current technology, where a different approach is used for each of these types of data (e.g., text and images). We plan to explore it in our future research. In <ref> [2] </ref> several enhancements were introduced to the basic idea of PMIC that were instrumental for achieving good results. For example: searching for reverse approximate matching, recognizing substrings in images that are additively shifted versions of each other, introducing a variable and adaptive maximum distortion level, and so forth. <p> Thus, PMIC can achieve a bit rate potentially smaller than the zeroth-order entropy of the differential image. We report in this paper our implementation and preliminary experimental results. 2 Review of PMIC This section is based on Atallah et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. The reader might also want to consult [8, 9, 13, 16] for theoretical background. The detection of the above-mentioned approximate repetitiveness is done by approximate pattern matching, whence the name Pattern Matching Image Compression (PMIC). <p> Let us discuss algorithmic challenges of PMIC. It boils down to an efficient algorithm for the longest prefix of length L n in yet uncompressed file. We present below one possible implementation (for others the reader is refereed to <ref> [2] </ref>). Let x n 1 denote the database, y m n+1 denote the yet uncompressed file. As before, we write d (x i ; y j ) for a distortion measure between two symbols, where d (; ) is understood to incorporate the max-difference criterion discussed earlier. <p> Set i := i + k We have used here the notation ex and ey for x and y, as they are understood in the COMPRESS ROW algorithm of <ref> [2] </ref> and discussed briefly above, except that what is now compressed is the quantized differential image, whence the e before x and y.

Reference-contexts: The distance measure subtending the notion of approximate 3 occurrence can be the Hamming distance, or of the square error distortion, or the string edit distance, or any of the other distances considered in the distortion theory (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>). In short, let us consider a stationary and ergodic sequence fX k g 1 k=1 taking values in a finite alphabet A (think of fX k g as an image scanned row by row). For image compression the alphabet A has size jAj = 256.

Reference-contexts: As seen in <ref> [11] </ref> and accordingly to Figure 2, the configuration of the 2-D predictor is as following: ^x m = 0:75A 0:50B + 0:75C: (2) where x m = x i;j , A = ^x i;j1 , B = ^x i1;j1 , and C = ^x i1;j . <p> In the above, e m stands for the error value between the original and the reconstructed pixels: e m = x m ^x m : (3) Finally, e ? m is the quantized value of e m , as described in <ref> [11] </ref> from which Table 1 is drawn. In fact, we add an offset of 128 to e ? m , making all of the error values positive (for an 8-bit original) so that they can be printed on a output device.
