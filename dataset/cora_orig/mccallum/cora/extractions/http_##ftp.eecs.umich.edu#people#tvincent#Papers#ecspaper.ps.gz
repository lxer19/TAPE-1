Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction During microelectronic manufacturing etching and deposition processes, measurement of film thickness is very useful. Currently, single or multiple wavelength reflectometers (sometimes also called interferometers) are commonly used for both in-situ and ex-situ measurements of film thickness [1-3], but obtaining both accuracy and computational efficiency can be challenging <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Techniques for in-situ real-time measurement of etch (or deposition) rate and film thickness hold the promise of great benefit in process development, on-line process diagnostics, and real-time feedback control.

Reference-contexts: All parameters except top film depth are considered known. We will not concern ourselves with the development of models for r here. For an isotropic, homogeneous thin film on an infinite substrate with normally incident light, the reflectance is well known <ref> [10] </ref>, and given by r (d) = fi fi 1 + r 01 r 12 e 2ifi fi fi (2) where r 01 = 1 + n 1 n 1 n 2 fi = and n 1 and n 2 are the refractive indices of the thin film and substrate respectively,

Reference-contexts: This model is easily extended to multiple films, and can be formulated so that all layers below the top film are combined into an effective substrate <ref> [11] </ref>. Effects such as surface roughness or non-planar topography may complicate the model. Incorporating these effects in the context of real time etch rate estimation is the subject of future research.

Reference-contexts: For linear dynamics and a linear output equation, the Kalman Filter (KF) calculates the minimum variance estimate <ref> [12] </ref>. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a method of extending the KF to nonlinear models by linearizing around trajectories. Needless to say, this estimate is only truly minimum variance if our model is correct, including the specification of probability distributions. <p> The EKF update equations are given below <ref> [12] </ref>. In this description, y is the measured output, K is the so called Kalman gain, ^ x is the estimate, and P is an auxiliary matrix which in the EKF stochastic formulation is an approximation to the error covariance matrix.

Reference-contexts: A significant feature of this experiment is that it is quite different from how reflectometry has been used to endpoint in the past <ref> [13] </ref>. In particular, with our method the endpoint need not be at an interface between two different materials. The wafers used consisted of approximately 500nm of unpatterned silicon dioxide on a silicon substrate etched in a CF 4 /Ar plasma. <p> In standard practice, it is customary to either count the number of peaks and valleys as the etch progresses, and stop at the desired extrema, or to look for a distinct change in the reflectance which occurs at an interface <ref> [13] </ref>. In both cases, the endpoint algorithm is trying to detect a particular feature, be it a zero slope or a large change in slope. These strategies are popular because finding these features does not depend on knowing the sensor gain or offset.
