Abstract: We present a semantic representation of the core concepts of the specification language Z in higher-order logic. Although it is a "shallow embedding" like the one presented by Bowen and Gordon, our representation preserves the structure of a Z specification and avoids expanding Z schemas. The representation is implemented in the higher-order logic instance of the generic theorem prover Isabelle. Its parser can convert the concrete syntax of Z schemas into their semantic representation and thus spare users from having to deal with the representation explicitly. Our representation essentially conforms with the latest draft of the Z standard and may give both a clearer understanding of Z schemas and inspire the development of proof calculi for Z.
