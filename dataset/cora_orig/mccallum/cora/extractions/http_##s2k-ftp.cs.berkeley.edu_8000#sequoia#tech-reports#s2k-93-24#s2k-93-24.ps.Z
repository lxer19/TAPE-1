Title: TextTiling: A Quantitative Approach to Discourse Segmentation  
Author: Marti A. Hearst

Affiliation: Computer Science Division,  University of California, Berkeley  
Abstract: This paper presents TextTiling, a method for partitioning full-length text documents into coherent multi-paragraph units. The layout of text tiles is meant to reflect the pattern of subtopics contained in an expository text. The approach uses lexical analyses based on tf.idf, an information retrieval measurement, to determine the extent of the tiles, incorporating thesaural information via a statistical disambiguation algorithm. The tiles have been found to correspond well to human judgements of the major subtopic boundaries of science magazine articles.

Reference-contexts: From a computational viewpoint, deducing textual topic structure from lexical connectivity alone is appealing, both because it is easy to compute, and also because discourse cues are sometimes misleading with respect to the topic structure <ref> (Brown & Yule 1983) </ref>(ch. 3). Following Skorochod'ko, TextTiling attempts to discover coherent, interrelated subdiscussions by analyz 1 The use of `topic' here is meant to signify pieces of text `about' something, as opposed to the topic/comment distinction found within individual sentences. <p> topic structure <ref> (Brown & Yule 1983) </ref>(ch. 3). Following Skorochod'ko, TextTiling attempts to discover coherent, interrelated subdiscussions by analyz 1 The use of `topic' here is meant to signify pieces of text `about' something, as opposed to the topic/comment distinction found within individual sentences. The intended sense is that described by (Brown & Yule 1983)(p. 69): In order to divide up a lengthy recording of conversational data into chunks which can be investigated in detail, the analyst is often forced to depend on intuitive notions about where one part of a conversation ends and another begins : : : The notion of

Reference-contexts: TextTiling lengthy documents also opens the door to interesting new information retrieval paradigms, as discussed in detail in (Hearst & Plaunt 1993). Also, techniques for text summarization and for determining good index terms, as explored in <ref> (Evans et al. 1991) </ref>, could be improved by providing information about the roles individual terms play with respect to what subtopic tile they appear in.

Reference-contexts: Many texts are best characterized as having a sequential structure; a hierarchical assumption could be misleading ((Sibun 1992) discusses this point in the context of generating spoken text). Separating tiling from a subsequent functional role analysis stage might make discerning these roles easier. <ref> (Givon 1983) </ref> presents a quantitative approach to discourse analysis which focuses on identification of syntactic clues, such as pronoun anaphora and cleft/focus constructions, to discover the continuity patterns of the discourse.

Reference-contexts: Many other researchers have studied the effects of trails of pronominal reference and other discourse cues, although usually not in such quantified terms.

Reference-contexts: For example, the words residential and apartment both index the same thesaural category and can thus be considered to be in a coherence relation with one another. The chains are used to structure texts according to Grosz and Sidner's theory of intentional discourse structure <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref>. This theory 4 is intrinsically hierarchical and fine-grained, and so its goals differ somewhat from those of this paper.

Reference-contexts: The simplest ev-idence to look for is repetition of words; repetition has been shown to be a coherence enhancer (Tannen 1989), (Walker 1991). Terms that are closely related in meaning also indicate coherence <ref> (Halliday & Hasan 1976) </ref>,(Morris & Hirst 1991). 2 For example, evidence that a dense discussion of volcanic activity is taking place in the fourth segment of the example above could be the observation of words related to volcanism, such as lava and eruption. <p> The paper concludes with a discussion of how this work will be extended. 2 (Raskin & Weiser 1987), following <ref> (Halliday & Hasan 1976) </ref>, distinguishes between cohesion and coherence; cohesion relations often act to indicate coherence in a passage. They also differentiate between lexical cohesion and grammatical cohesion relations; an example of the latter is pronomial reference. <p> Morris, influenced by Halliday and Hasan's theory of lexical coherence <ref> (Halliday & Hasan 1976) </ref>, developed an algorithm that finds chains of related terms via a comprehensive thesaurus (again, Roget's Fourth Edition). For example, the words residential and apartment both index the same thesaural category and can thus be considered to be in a coherence relation with one another.

Reference-contexts: Since the algorithm is to be measured against human judgement data, it is designed to group the sentences at the level of granularity that the judges displayed.

Reference-contexts: A disadvantage is that it does require a good thesaurus. Since Roget's Fourth Edition is not openly available online, a set of 740 categories was derived from the noun hierarchy of WordNet <ref> (Miller et al. 1990) </ref>, a hand-built lexical thesaurus.

Reference-contexts: Lacking a standard test set, 5 the algorithm was evaluated on two data sources: three expository articles (length 77 to 160 sentences), and the five short general interest articles from <ref> (Morris 1988) </ref> (length 23 to 44 sentences). Human judgement data was gathered via an informal study in which several readers were given each text, with all section markers and diagrams removed, and asked to draw a line beneath a sentence wherever they perceived a change in topic.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this kind of strategy usually encounters problems with polysemy; since many words can take on more than one meaning, they are erroneously linked up with words to which they should not be related. To help alleviate the polysemy problem, a version of Yarowsky's statistical lexical disambiguation algorithm <ref> (Yarowsky 1992) </ref> was implemented. Yarowsky defines word senses as the categories listed for a word in Roget's Thesaurus (Fourth Edition), where a category is something like TOOLS/MACHINERY.
