Abstract: Recording and analyzing the dynamics of application program, system software, and hardware interactions are the keys to understanding and tuning the performance of massively parallel systems. Because massively parallel systems contain hundreds or thousands of processors, each potentially with many dynamic performance metrics, the performance data occupy a sparsely populated, high-dimensional space. These dynamic performance metrics for each processor define a group of evolving, n-dimensional points. Understanding the dynamic "shape" of these metric paths is only possible if one can examine multiple projections. We have implemented an immersive virtual world, called Avatar, that shows all the possible three-dimensional projections of a sparsely populated, n-dimensional metric space. The presentation metaphor is a three-dimensional generalization of a two-dimensional scatterplot matrix. Users can walk inside a single scatterplot cube, fly about the cube of scatterplot cubes, control selected characteristics of the scatterplot display, listen to the sounds of statistical data attributes, and interactively modify application behavior and performance in real time.

Reference-contexts: Our work differs in its generalization of scatterplot matrices to encompass three-dimensional scatterplots and the integration of history lines to show phase behavior. The closest analog to our work within the virtual reality community is Feiner and Besher's work on multi-dimensional data spaces for visualization of financial data. AutoVision <ref> [1] </ref> and it's predecessor, n-Vision [3], use "worlds within worlds" to display N -dimensional data. Both create a hierarchy of three-dimensional displays, where within a display one can recursively nest other displays by selecting a point. Our work differs by imposing no hierarchy on the data dimensions.

Reference-contexts: In consequence, the complementary scientific visualization techniques focus on intuitive renderings of regularly spaced, n-dimensional data sets. In contrast, performance data is irregular in both space and time, and other performance presentation techniques (e.g., those from statistical graphics <ref> [2] </ref>) are more appropriate. <p> As an example, Figure 2 shows an 8-dimensional scatterplot matrix, where the performance data are from a parallel genome sequencing code that involves large amounts of input/output and interprocessor communication. 3 The diagonal of this scatterplot matrix contains box and whisker plots <ref> [2] </ref> of the minimum, mean and quartiles of each metric. read durations) are highly correlated, but others are not (e.g., blocking (synchronous) message send delays and procedure invocation lifetimes). <p> Rather than enabling history for all points, we have discovered that enabling history for a subset of the points (e.g., those in a bounding volume or a few representatives) provides more insight. In this case, history lines play the role of brushing <ref> [2] </ref> in statistical graphics | if representatives are clustered in all scattercubes, then the data is clustered in all dimensions. We have found the redundant rotations of non-degenerate cubes to be especially useful. <p> In short, it will be possible to analyze the end-to-end performance as a function of user behavior and data complexity. 8 Related Research Our research draws on a long history of statistical graphics and virtual reality research.

Reference-contexts: experiences with Avatar, our plans for continued research, and the relation of our research to that of others. 2 Performance Data Complexity Although a plethora of instrumentation techniques have been both proposed and implemented, all rely on one of four basic instrumentation techniques: interval timing, counting, sampling, or event tracing <ref> [8] </ref>. All strike a different balance between performance data volume, instrumentation overhead, and behavioral detail, and an appropriate choice depends on one's goals and measurement infrastructure. Event tracing, by combining elements of both counting and timing, is the most general and also the most intrusive instrumentation mechanism. <p> Capturing multiple gigabytes of performance data both perturbs application behavior and leads to exorbitant post-mortem storage and data analysis costs. To retain the advantages of detailed event tracing while minimizing post-mortem analysis overhead, one can exploit parallel system resources to reduce and display the data in real time <ref> [9, 8] </ref>. <p> Below, we describe the software and hardware infrastructure needed to satisfy these constraints, together with the most salient aspects of their interaction. 7 4.1 Software instrumented using the Pablo 4 performance instrumentation software <ref> [9, 8] </ref>, generates a times-tamped performance data in the Pablo Self-Describing Data Format (SDDF). A data interface accepts performance data from the parallel system and buffers it for subsequent rendering by the presentation metaphor software. <p> The resulting performance data can be output to either a file for post-mortem analysis or sent directly to Avatar via a Unix socket for real-time analysis. All performance data is described by the Pablo Self-Describing Data Format (SDDF) <ref> [8] </ref>. SDDF shares features of other data meta-formats but has been designed specifically for describing performance data. Because SDDF records are self-describing, the SDDF library can extract records and record fields based on a parse of the record definitions. <p> This process continues until the test sequence has been compared against all entries in the data base. 5.2 Performance Instrumentation and Application Controls Using the Pablo instrumentation software <ref> [9, 8] </ref>, we modified the gene sequencing code to generate a timestamped trace of procedure entries and exits, message passing, and all input/output operations. Using this trace data, an extension to Pablo instrumentation software creates a reduced trace that contains sliding window averages. <p> The first step on this path is capturing and understanding the dynamic input/output behavior of current applications, and both the Pablo <ref> [8, 9] </ref> and Avatar software are the bases for this effort.

Reference-contexts: Our work differs by imposing no hierarchy on the data dimensions. All are treated as equals, and one need not assign an a priori order or importance. Finally, because Avatar supports real-time adaptive control, it bears some relation to other telepresence projects (e.g., the MBARI remotely operated vehicle (ROV) <ref> [10] </ref> and the UNC/UCLA nanomanipulator [11]). Avatar differs from both ROV and the nanomanipulator in its focus on abstract, multivariate data rather than a physical system.
