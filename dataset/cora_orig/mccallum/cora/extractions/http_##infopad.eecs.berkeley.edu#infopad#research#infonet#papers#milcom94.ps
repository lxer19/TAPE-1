Abstract: The scant bandwidth and high error rates of the wireless channel make joint source-channel coding desirable for optimizing resource usage. To this end, we propose a multiple substream abstraction for source traffic, with delay and loss characteristics negotiated between the application and network on a per-sub-stream basis. This model affords flexibility while maintaining network efficiency by only appropriating more resources (e.g. bandwidth and error protection) to more important user information. We describe an algorithm for supporting different quality of service (QOS) requirements for different traffic in an interference-limited cellular CDMA environment. The algorithm accepts QOS specifications for different substreams, accommodates them by assigning different power levels to each signal, and can be used to add or drop substream connections dynamically while ensuring that QOS specifications are not violated. Present-day power control schemes are used to combat the near-far effect; while the proposed algorithm also accomplishes this goal, it is in fact more general: via power modulation, it can provision different QOS levels for different substreams.

Reference-contexts: Hence, dynamically changing the error protection on a sub-stream with time becomes very difficult on a wireless channel with constrained bandwidth. On an ideal non-dispersive channel with bandwidth B, it is possible to send 2BT waveforms, each of duration T, with zero crosscorrelation between any pair of received waveforms <ref> [1] </ref>. A wireless channel, however, introduces multipath interference, so that this perfect orthogonality be Power Control for Variable QOS on a CDMA Channel Louis C. Yun and David G.

Reference-contexts: A fading channel complicates the analysis, but a monotonic one-to-one mapping between the average BER and the ratio E b /N o can still be derived (e.g. see <ref> [3] </ref>). We will therefore specify the reliability requirement of a substream by its desired energy-to-interference ratio.

Reference-contexts: Embedded trellis coded modulation (TCM) constellations have been suggested for the terrestrial broadcast channel, but their implementation grows very complex for more than two different levels of error protection <ref> [5] </ref>. Algebraic codes for UEP also exist [6][7], although the question of constructing good codes is still an open issue. Both these two approaches are more suited towards UEP at the bit level than at higher levels.

Reference-contexts: A simple modulation scheme satisfying this criterion is M-ary PSK: scaling an MPSK signal constellation also scales the degree of noise immunity, as desired, yet leaves the decision regions invariant. MPSK is an example of the more general group codes <ref> [10] </ref>. The points of a group code are generated by a group of orthogonal transformations of an initial vector, and lie on the surface of an N-dimensional sphere.

Reference-contexts: The points of a group code are generated by a group of orthogonal transformations of an initial vector, and lie on the surface of an N-dimensional sphere. The existence of higher dimension group codes offering greater coding gains over two-dimensional MPSK has long been predicted <ref> [11] </ref>, and it can also be shown that the maximum shaping gain is achieved by a spherical multidimensional constellation [12]. We therefore choose to construct a multidimensional MPSK constellation, consistent with the criterion for transparency of the power control layer to the decoder.

Reference-contexts: We do not generate the code vectors by applying a group of orthogonal transformations, as such a scheme is known to be suboptimal. In fact, an exact solution to the problem of uniformly packing M points on an N-sphere does not exist to date <ref> [13] </ref>. Instead, we generate the code vectors by a computer simulated relaxation algorithm, as follows: random points lying on the surface of an sphere are initially created. Each point is subjected to a repulsive force from every other point, proportional to the pairwise distance between points.
