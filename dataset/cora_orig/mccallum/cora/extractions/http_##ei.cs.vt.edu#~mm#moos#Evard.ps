Title: Collaborative Networked Communication: MUDs as Systems Tools  
Author: Rmy Evard 
Affiliation: Northeastern University  
Abstract: A systems administration group is only as effective as its internal communication mechanisms. On-line communication has traditionally been managed via electronic mail or news, which are neither real-time nor truly collaborative. Communication tools which let multiple parties work together in real-time have become widespread on the Internet in the last several years. In an effort to keep a physically disjoint systems staff working together effectively, we have explored the use of MUDs as communications tools. By allowing many people to interact in an extensible environment, MUDs have solved many of the problems that we had with on-line communication, and provided many unexpected benefits as well.

Reference-contexts: After some exploration, we decided to test a MUD for a few weeks. MUDs MUD stands for Multi User Dungeon (or, pretentiously, Multi User Dimension). The original MUD was written in 1979 by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle on a DECsystem-10 at Essex University <ref> [Bart90] </ref>. It was a game similar to the classic Colossal Cave adventure, except that it allowed multiple people to play at the same time and interact with each other. Reportedly, this was enormously popular, and the idea caught on.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps: A worried-looking squirrel scampers in through the window and says, "denali is unreachable at 3:45 pm" ... then again, perhaps not. Current research at Xerox PARC involves integrating MUDs with audio, video, and shared programs <ref> [Curt93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One tool that currently exists in our MUD is a Gopher client. We ported this code from another 1993 LISA - November 1-5, 1993 - Monterey, CA 3 Collaborative Networked Communication: MUDs as Systems Tools Evard MUD, where it was originally developed <ref> [Masi93] </ref>. Instead of simply running a command that pops a Gopher interface up on the MUD, the Gopher client was built into the spatial metaphor of the MUD, and exists in the MUD as a "Gopher slate", something like a portable computer.
