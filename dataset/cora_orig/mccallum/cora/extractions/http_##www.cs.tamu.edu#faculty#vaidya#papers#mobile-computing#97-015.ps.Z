Abstract: For mobile users who move frequently but receive relatively rare calls, a forwarding scheme has been shown to outperform the normal IS-41 location management scheme. But the forwarding scheme is more vulnerable to failure of intermediate Visitor Location Registers (VLRs) than the IS-41 scheme. We propose two simple variations to the forwarding scheme to address the fault tolerance weakness. One is based on the idea of maintaining two paths from the home location server to the last VLR. The second scheme is based on the knowledge of the neighbors of the "faulty" VLR. We evaluate and compare the performance of these location management schemes.

Reference-contexts: This is achieved using an appropriate location management strategy. A simple location management strategy would use a fixed database to store the current location of a mobile terminal (MT). This approach is used in the North American standard IS-41 <ref> [2] </ref>. As elaborated later in the paper, the IS-41 location management strategy is based on a two-tier system consisting of a Home Location Register (HLR) and Visitor Location Registers (VLR). <p> Simple data management strategies, such as IS-41, would not handle these loads efficiently [17, 16]. Therefore, several approaches have been investigated to try to reduce network loads by exploiting specific patterns of mobility and call arrival <ref> [15, 13, 2, 3, 10, 6] </ref>. This paper considers a "forwarding" strategy proposed by Jain and Lin [15]. This strategy is used for those users who move frequently, but receive calls relatively infrequently. <p> Acharya et al. [1] consider the checkpointing of distributed applications. They consider specifically schemes to tolerate the failure of a mobile host or its disconnection. No work, to our knowledge, considers delivery of calls despite a VLR failure. 3 The PCS architecture The PCS architecture consists of two networks <ref> [2] </ref> : the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and a signaling network. The PSTN is the traditional telephone system carrying voice, while the signaling network, meant for management purposes, uses the SS7 (Signaling System no 7 [18]). <p> The MSC and the VLR can be connected through the STP (SS7 signaling network) routers or with a direct X25 link. We omit some details in this architecture which are beyond the scope of this paper (please refer to <ref> [2, 14] </ref> for a good description). 4 Location Management Schemes Any location management scheme must provide two basic operations : * MOVE : to register the new location when a mobile terminal enters a new RA * FIND : to determine the current location for a given mobile terminal (to deliver <p> Second, the MSC associated with VLR V b will deliver a Temporary Local Directory Number (TLDN) to HLR H b . This TLDN will be used to set the circuit between the caller and the callee on the PSTN network <ref> [2] </ref>. When MT a dials the call, the call will reach the mobile switching center M a . M a then queries MT a's current visitor location register V a . <p> This VLR V b then forwards the call request to its associated mobile switching center M b . The MSC M b provides a "Temporary Local Directory Number (TLDN)". This TLDN is used to set up the call over the PSTN network <ref> [2] </ref>. 6 In the first of above two cases, FIND operation is not needed as both MTs are covered by the same VLR. In this case, the location management scheme used is not relevant. <p> If we assume that each VLR covers an hexagonal region, then we can approximate the cost to "bypass" a VLR with 5:T (request forwarded to five neighbors). The assumption of a hexagonal region is accurate since VLRs cover large regions <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: They present a fault-tolerant protocol to maintain this directory despite base station failures and mobile disconnections. In their scheme, all base stations are updated after each mobile moves from one base station to another. The main problem addressed is avoiding old updates from overwriting current information. Alagar et al. <ref> [4] </ref> consider the problem of base station failures. They present two schemes to tolerate such failures which are based on secondary base stations. The idea is to use replication (optimistic or pessimistic) on the secondary base stations. Pradhan et al. [19] consider recovery from failures of the mobile host.

Reference-contexts: His approach is based on periodic checkpointing of location databases. Lin derives the optimal interval for checkpointing. The fault tolerance schemes presented here are also related to work on fault tolerant linked lists (for instance, <ref> [11, 5] </ref>). However, we investigate this problem in the context of location management of mobile hosts. In [20], Rangarajan and Dahbura consider an architecture where each base station maintains the location directory of all mobiles in the network.

Reference-contexts: However, on every K-th MOVE, instead of setting a forwarding pointer, the HLR is updated, i.e., pointer chain is compressed. The expected number of compressions between two calls can be calculated as 1 (1+p) K 1 <ref> [15, 7] </ref>. Each chain compression requires an HLR update, incurring the same cost as a move operation in IS41 (this cost is denoted as M IS41 ).

This paper considers a "forwarding" strategy proposed by Jain and Lin <ref> [15] </ref>. This strategy is used for those users who move frequently, but receive calls relatively infrequently. As elaborated later, for such users, the forwarding scheme avoids the update of the Home Location Register (HLR) by setting a pointer from the previous VLR to the new VLR. <p> MOVE : to register the new location when a mobile terminal enters a new RA * FIND : to determine the current location for a given mobile terminal (to deliver a call) 4 In this section, we describe the IS-41 location management strategy, the forwarding scheme by Jain and Lin <ref> [15] </ref>, and two ways of incorporating fault tolerance in the forwarding scheme. <p> In this case, the location management scheme used is not relevant. Therefore, in further discussion and analysis, we consider only the case where V a 6= V b . 4.2 Forwarding Strategy The forwarding strategy, proposed by Jain and Lin <ref> [15] </ref>, modifies the IS-41 scheme such that it does not involve the HLR at each MOVE operation, even if the MT enters a new RA covered by a new VLR. Instead, at each move involving a new VLR, a pointer is established from the old VLR to the new VLR. <p> In this case, the pointer chain length (from VLR A to the new VLR D) would be equal to threshold K = 3. Therefore, the home location register is informed of the new VLR, and a pointer is set at the HLR to point directly to VLR D <ref> [15] </ref>. Therefore, the chain length becomes 0. 7 For the FIND operation, the chain of VLRs will be queried until getting the current VLR covering the mobile terminal. Assume that a mobile terminal a is calling mobile terminal b. <p> After mobile terminal b is found, the forwarding pointer chain is compressed as shown in Figure 4 (b). That is, after the FIND operation, the HLR for b is updated. While the forwarding scheme has performance advantages <ref> [15] </ref>, it is more vulnerable to VLR failures as compared to IS-41. For instance, in Figure 4 (a), to be able to deliver the call, VLRs A, B and C must be failure-free. With IS-41, only VLR C would need to be failure-free. <p> The cost could be in terms of bandwidth usage, time required, amount of money, etc. The actual meaning of the term cost does not affect our cost analysis. This approach is similar to that used in previous work <ref> [15, 13, 3, 10] </ref>. We will use the following notations in this section. <p> f i for the two fault tolerant schemes (i.e., i = 1; 2). 5.1 Expected cost per call C 1 for scheme 1 5.1.1 Expected cost of MOVE operations per call using scheme 1 The expression for M 1 can be obtained using the analysis presented by Jain and Lin <ref> [15] </ref>. The analysis presented by Jain and Lin does not consider failures. However, since MT movements are not influenced by failures, we can use their results to obtain M 1 . 12 p = c = m is the call-to-mobility ratio. <p> However, on every K-th MOVE, instead of setting a forwarding pointer, the HLR is updated, i.e., pointer chain is compressed. The expected number of compressions between two calls can be calculated as 1 (1+p) K 1 <ref> [15, 7] </ref>. Each chain compression requires an HLR update, incurring the same cost as a move operation in IS41 (this cost is denoted as M IS41 ). <p> While the analysis presented by Jain and Lin <ref> [15] </ref> was useful to determine M 1 , it is not useful to obtain the cost of a FIND operation using scheme 1. To derive F 1 and F f 1 , we model a chain length for a mobile terminal with a Markov model on Figure 7.
