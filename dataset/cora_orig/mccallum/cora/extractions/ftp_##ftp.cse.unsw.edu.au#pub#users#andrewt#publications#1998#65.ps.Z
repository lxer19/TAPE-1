Abstract: A recently developed theory of local reasoning with diagrams is applied to a practical domain, that of inserting a node into a singly linked list, to illustrate its explanatory power. Prior to this demonstration there was only an informal feel as to why diagrams used to explain the generation of imperative code for similar applications should work. This paper is a partial answer to the charge that theory in artificial intelligence is remote from application. On the contrary, it shows that properly constrained theories can assist in underpinning cognitive tools. Keywords: diagrammatic reasoning, imperative programming, linked lists, finite models, actions.

Both the papers use logic as the textual mode but make the point that it is not intended that one should regard diagrams as merely a more convenient mode of expression that can in principle be replaced by logic.

Reference-contexts: Definition 4 Two L structures U 1 and U 2 are elementarily equivalent, written U 1 j U 2 , if for every sentence OE 2 L, U 1 j= OE iff U 2 j= OE. These three definitions are standard <ref> [Chang and Keisler 73] </ref>. Two elementarily equivalent structures satisfy exactly the same set of sentences, and are therefore indistinguishable by sentences. This is an extremely strong condition.

Reference-contexts: Such formulas are important enough to merit a formal description. We reproduce a simplified version of such a description from <ref> [Foo 98] </ref>. Definition 1 (EnE sentences) A EnE sentence of width n based on c is 9x 1 OE 1 (x 1 ) where: OE 1 (x 1 ) is P 1 (c; x 1 ) ^ 9x 2 OE 2 (x 2 ); . . . <p> It turns out that this region can be determined precisely for pre-conditions that are EnE sentences and they are typical of many applications. The paper [Foo, et.al. 97] initiated investigations into the localness of actions, and these were subsequently embellished in <ref> [Foo 98] </ref>. The relevant definitions and results from the latter paper are paraphrased below for completeness. Definition 2 Suppose L is a first-order language with equality but no function symbols. <p> This motivates the closure definition below (reproduced from <ref> [Foo 98] </ref>). <p> Technically, the validity of this operation is confirmed by the Pre-condition and Post-condition Conservative Extension theorems below. They are only valid for actions with pre-conditions that have the EnE syntax described above (or more generally, any Boolean combinations thereof). For proofs, we refer the reader to <ref> [Foo 98] </ref>. Theorem 1 (Pre-condition Conservative Extension) Let an EnE formula OE [a 1 ; : : : ; a n ] be a pre-condition of an action instance to be applied to state U .

Reference-contexts: Corollary 1 The cut-and-paste procedure in the finite figures 1, 2 and 3 correctly reflect the node insertion logic for the potentially unbounded figure 4. As a matter of some interest we mention that in work on conceptual graphs, a diagrammatic logic introduced by Sowa <ref> [Sowa] </ref>, there is also a version of a cut-and-paste theorem but geared toward proofs. The genericity of the windows, and the schema-like semantics of action specifications is captured by the following observation, which is a corollary of the preceding theorems.
