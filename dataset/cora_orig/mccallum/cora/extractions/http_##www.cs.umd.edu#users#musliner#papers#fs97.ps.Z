Abstract: The Distributed CIRCA (D-CIRCA) project is focused on developing planning technology to concurrently build and execute real-time control plans for multiple cooperating autonomous agents. In this paper, we demonstrate how the goals of the D-CIRCA program relating to distributed, cooperating agents motivate our recent work on Dynamic Abstraction Planning (DAP). We contend that problems of incomplete knowledge, limited communication bandwidth, and state-space explosion can all be addressed by abstraction. We present a high-level description of the DAP technique and conclude by outlining several issues for future work.
