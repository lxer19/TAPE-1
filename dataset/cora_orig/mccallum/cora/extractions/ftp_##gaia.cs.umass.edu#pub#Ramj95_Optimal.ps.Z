Title: On Optimal Call Admission Control in Cellular Networks  
Author: Ramachandran Ramjee Ramesh Nagarajan Don Towsley 
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science AT&T Bell Labs Dept. Of Computer Science University of Massachusetts Holmdel, NJ University of Massachusetts  
Abstract: Two important Quality-of-Service (QoS) measures for current cellular networks are the fractions of new and handoff "calls" that are blocked due to unavailability of "channels" (radio and/or computing resources). Based on these QoS measures, we derive optimal admission control policies for three problems: minimizing a linear objective function of the new and hand-off call blocking probabilities (MINOBJ), minimizing the new call blocking probability with a hard constraint on the handoff call blocking probability (MINBLOCK) and minimizing the number of channels with hard constraints on both of the blocking probabilities (MINC). We show that the well-known Guard Channel policy is optimal for the MINOBJ problem, while a new Fractional Guard Channel policy is optimal for the MINBLOCK and MINC problems. The Guard Channel policy reserves a set of channels for handoff calls while the Fractional Guard Channel policy effectively reserves a non-integral number of guard channels for handoff calls by rejecting new calls with some probability that depends on the current channel occupancy. It is also shown that the Fractional policy results in significant savings (20-50%) in the new call blocking probability for the MINBLOCK problem and provides some, though small, gains over the Integral Guard Channel policy for the MINC problem. Further, we also develop computationally inexpensive algorithms for the determination of the parameters for the optimal policies.

Reference-contexts: The following lemma is needed to establish the optimal policy for the MINOBJ problem. Lemma 1: V k (i) is monotonically non decreasing and convex in i for all k. Proof: Refer to <ref> [7] </ref> for details of the proof. Under minor technical conditions, it can be shown that the optimal cost function for the infinite horizon problem, V (i) = lim k!1 V k (i), is also nondecreasing and convex [11, Assumption 8.28]. We now return to consider the average cost problem. <p> 2 A 2 A T 2 , then policy g T is optimal for the MINOBJ problem, with A 1 = 1, where A T 8 : W T X T 1 W T 1 X T 1 T = 1; :::; C; 1 T = 0: Proof: Refer to <ref> [7] </ref> for details of the proof. 2 Consider the Limited Fractional Guard Channel policy f k;q := [g k1 ; g k ; q]; q 2 [0; 1] (6) which admits new calls at state k 1 with probability q, and admits only handoff calls from states k through C. <p> Now, we show that f k;q is optimal for the MINBLOCK problem. We need the following lemma, the proof of which is found in <ref> [7] </ref>. Lemma 3: Consider J ! (u) = B n (u) + !B h (u). Then if A T 2 ! A T1 2 , policy g T1 is optimal by the previous lemma. <p> Similarly, differentiating B n with respect to fi, we can show that the derivative is negative. Thus, we can prove that B n decreases monotonically with fi. The reader is referred to <ref> [7] </ref> for details which show that Algorithm MINB minimizes the new call blocking probability (B n ()) while satisfying the constraint on handoff call blocking probability (B h () P h ). Informally, given the previous lemma, it is easy to see that MINB is just a root finding algorithm. <p> Algorithm MIN detailed in Figure 7 is more efficient. The following claims will be useful in proving that algorithm MIN finds the minimum number of channels that satisfies the constraints expressed in Equations (8) and (9). We encourage the reader to refer to <ref> [7] </ref> for the proof of the following claims and the correctness of algorithm MIN.

Reference-contexts: We note that the control policy that achieves the minimum cost is a stationary policy, i.e., it depends only on the current state, which we denote as u (i). Given the stationary control policy, the state of the system now evolves as a Markov decision process <ref> [8] </ref> and in particular our interest will be only in stationary policies that lead to irreducible Markov chains. <p> We now return to consider the average cost problem. The opti mal control policy for the average cost problem is also stationary and the optimality equation is given as <ref> [8] </ref>: g + h (i) = 1 min (h (i + 1) ; A 1 + h (i)) + i h (i 1) + (C i) h (i); where g = lim !1 (1 )V (0) is a constant and h (i) = lim r!1 [V r (i) V r (0)]
