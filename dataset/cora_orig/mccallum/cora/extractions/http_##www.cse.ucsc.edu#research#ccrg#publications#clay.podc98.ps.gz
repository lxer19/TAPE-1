Title: The HIP Protocol for Hierarchical Multicast Routing

Abstract: This paper presents a new, flexible approach to inter-domain multicast routing. The HIP protocol introduces the idea of "virtual routers" as a method of organizing the control of an entire domain so as to appear as a single router on a higher-level shared tree. HIP then routes between domains using the Ordered Core Based Tree (OCBT) protocol, and allows recursive application of virtual routers to create a multi-leveled hierarchy while providing efficient methods of distributing the location of the center point for the tree. The advantages of this approach include improved robustness, the ability to route between heterogeneous domains, and a significant reduction in the amount of bandwidth consumed in control traffic and in the amount of state stored at each router over existing hierarchical multicast protocols.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, OCBT uses the existing uni-cast routing table to make its routing decisions; routers do not need to maintain a separate table to locate other mul-ticast routers. OCBT functions similarly to the Core Based Tree protocol (CBT) <ref> [1] </ref> in that a router wishing to join the tree sends a join request towards the closest core.

Reference-contexts: If it were possible to define each logical level of core as an actual level of a hierarchy, it would be an simple task to create such a tree. However, both OCBT and HPIM [7], a similar construction for PIM <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, suffer in hierarchical application from the fact that it is very difficult to come up with a hierarchical placement of cores or RPs without extensive knowledge of the network topography and the receiver set.

Reference-contexts: There are four approaches to distributing this information <ref> [4] </ref>: advertisement at the application level; advertisement at the router level; a distributed directory supporting center point lookup; and algorithmic mapping.

Reference-contexts: Recognizing these benefits, the IDMR working group of the IETF has been developing a shared-tree, hierarchical protocol currently called the Border Gateway Mul-ticast Protocol (BGMP) [11]. Along with the Multicast Address Set Claim protocol (MASC) <ref> [5] </ref>, BGMP proposes a mechanism for building associating groups of multicast addresses with particular domains and then building a single level tree of domains to the domain associated with that mul-ticast address. <p> HIP does not require that this particular method of CP location be used if other methods are made popular. For example, the Multicast Address Set Claim <ref> [5] </ref> provides a method of distributing a mapping of multicast addresses to particular domain which act as center points and could be used with HIP without significant modification; however our methods allow for easy mixing of sender and receiver initiated protocols.

Reference-contexts: In a receiver initiated protocol, it starts when some internal router receives an IGMP <ref> [6] </ref> message from a subnet requesting the multicast. This physical router sends a join request to some border router of its domain and connects to it. If the border routers do not have the correct CP information, one retrieves it via the method described in Section 3.2.

Reference-contexts: It is this labeling and breaking mechanism that ensures that OCBT remains loop free. If it were possible to define each logical level of core as an actual level of a hierarchy, it would be an simple task to create such a tree. However, both OCBT and HPIM <ref> [7] </ref>, a similar construction for PIM [2, 3], suffer in hierarchical application from the fact that it is very difficult to come up with a hierarchical placement of cores or RPs without extensive knowledge of the network topography and the receiver set.

Reference-contexts: The first is to provide a means of routing between heterogeneous domains that might use any multicast protocol internally. The second, and perhaps more pressing, is that the protocol currently being used for multi-cast routing on the Internet, the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) <ref> [8] </ref>, is unable to scale with the exponential growth of the Internet. DVMRP computes and maintains its own unicast routing table between DVMRP capable routers; as the number of multicast capable subnets has grown exponentially, so has the size of the table maintained at each router.

Reference-contexts: This can be a major benefit as the virtual router can be made to use policy-based unicast routing scheme, such as BGP <ref> [9] </ref>, to route to other domains. The scheme is also flexible enough to allow for virtual routers within virtual routers if necessary. This can be used for as many levels of hierarchy as needed or desired, as demonstrated in Section 3.

Reference-contexts: The first approach was one of the motivations for creating the Ordered Core based Tree protocol (OCBT) <ref> [10] </ref>. OCBT is a hard-state protocol, so once a branch of the tree is constructed, it is not removed until a link failure occurs on the branch or all receivers lower on a branch quit from the tree; this reduces the control traffic required to construct and maintain the tree. <p> Recursive application of these proofs will then show HIP to be correct at all levels. First, OCBT has been previously proven to operate correctly; it always produces a mul-ticast tree in finite time even under unstable unicast routing and link and router failure <ref> [10] </ref>. The proof relies on the fact that timers are used to generate retransmissions, so OCBT is always live, and that the use of logical-level labels guarantees that branches will form while preventing loops in the construction of the tree. <p> These are correct assumptions for all OCBT domains, as OCBT correctly builds a tree in finite time in any connected component following a failure or partition <ref> [10] </ref>. If, in fact, the internal multicast cannot support this, the virtual router protocol encapsulating that domain will need additional functionality to fulfill those requirements.

Reference-contexts: Domains are also generally connected by fewer higher-speed links, which reduces the inherent shared-tree problem of link congestion. Recognizing these benefits, the IDMR working group of the IETF has been developing a shared-tree, hierarchical protocol currently called the Border Gateway Mul-ticast Protocol (BGMP) <ref> [11] </ref>. Along with the Multicast Address Set Claim protocol (MASC) [5], BGMP proposes a mechanism for building associating groups of multicast addresses with particular domains and then building a single level tree of domains to the domain associated with that mul-ticast address.

Reference-contexts: The end result is that each member only has to keep routes to the subnets in its domain, resulting in smaller routing tables and lower overhead. This method still creates a single spanning tree; at the highest level it appears as a tree of domains. Hierarchical DVMRP (HDVMRP) <ref> [12] </ref> divides the current flat routing region into disparate parts and assigns each a unique name. DVMRP is then used within each routing domain for intra-domain routing and between each region for inter-domain routing.
