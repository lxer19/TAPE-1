Reference-contexts: TTCN supports the use of ASN.1 definitions and there exist TTCN Compilers <ref> [1, 11] </ref> which allow to generate executable test cases from TTCN descriptions. As described in the previous sections, we specify test cases by means of MSC, RL, and ASN.1/TTCN data type and constraints definitions. The implementation of such test case specifications can be fully automated.

Reference-contexts: In the telecommunication area tests are also a prerequisite to ensure the interworking of products from several manufacturers. A typical test environment of our application area is shown in Figure 1. We want to test the functions of the layer 3 protocol Q.931 <ref> [2] </ref> within a Line Trunk Group (LTG) of an ISDN switching system. The Q.931 protocol is implemented within the LTG and there is no direct access to this implementation. Furthermore, each LTG has only one standardized interface which may be connected to an ISDN end system (e.g. a telephone).

Reference-contexts: In the following we assume that data types are defined by using ASN.1 and constraints are specified by means of the ASN.1 value notation and TTCN matching mechanisms. ASN.1 and TTCN are standardized <ref> [7, 3] </ref> and frequently used in the telecommunication area. Data type definitions The data types of a protocol are constant for all test cases. They are often provided by the standard documents, or they have to be specified once at the beginning of the test process.

Reference-contexts: Section 4). 3 MESSAGE FLOW DESCRIPTION We identified the Message Sequence Chart (MSC) language to be adequate for describing the message flow of test cases. MSC is a graphical language, it is standardized by the ITU-T Recommendation Z.120 <ref> [4, 8] </ref>, it has a formal semantics definition [9], and there exist tools which support the use of the language [5, 12, 13]. A small MSC diagram can be found in the upper part of Figure 6.

TTCN supports the use of ASN.1 definitions and there exist TTCN Compilers [1, 11] which allow to generate executable test cases from TTCN descriptions. As described in the previous sections, we specify test cases by means of MSC, RL, and ASN.1/TTCN data type and constraints definitions.

Reference-contexts: Section 4). 3 MESSAGE FLOW DESCRIPTION We identified the Message Sequence Chart (MSC) language to be adequate for describing the message flow of test cases. MSC is a graphical language, it is standardized by the ITU-T Recommendation Z.120 <ref> [4, 8] </ref>, it has a formal semantics definition [9], and there exist tools which support the use of the language [5, 12, 13]. A small MSC diagram can be found in the upper part of Figure 6. <p> Within an MSC the statements of RL are related to messages. They can be found in parentheses close to the corresponding message name, or message arrow (cf. Figure 6). This is no extension of the MSC language, because the MSC standard <ref> [8] </ref> proposes to use expressions in round brackets to assign parameter information to messages. Schematically, an RL statement has the following shape: (M ; P 1; P 2; P 11; P 12; P 21; P 22) It consists of several parts which are separated by semicolons.

Reference-contexts: A message has a hierarchical structure. A part of an RL statement represents a hierarchy level. The subparts describe elements within a hierarchy level. The message structure of the schematic RL statement presented above is shown in Figure 5. The details on RL can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. An example may provide an impression of how the reference mechanism works. The MSC in Figure 6 describes the most relevant part of the message flow of EDSAOUX, i.e. the reception of the three Information messages. The inscription of each Information message ( ; Display:DisplayEDSAOUX) is an RL statement. <p> As described in the previous sections, we specify test cases by means of MSC, RL, and ASN.1/TTCN data type and constraints definitions. The implementation of such test case specifications can be fully automated. Details on this step can be found in <ref> [12, 10] </ref>. 6 TOOL SUPPORT We implemented our test case specification method by a set of prototype tools.
