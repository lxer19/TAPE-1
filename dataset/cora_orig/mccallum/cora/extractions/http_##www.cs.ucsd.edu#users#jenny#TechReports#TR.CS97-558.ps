Abstract: Accurate performance predictions are difficult to achieve for parallel applications executing on production distributed systems. Conventional point-valued performance parameters and prediction models are often inaccurate since they can only represent one point in a range of possible behaviors. We address this problem by allowing characteristic application and system data to be represented by a set of possible values and their probabilities, which we call stochastic values. In this paper, we give a practical methodology for using stochastic values as parameters to adaptable performance prediction models. We demonstrate their usefulness for a distributed SOR application, showing stochastic values to be more effective than single (point) values in predicting the range of application behavior that can occur during execution in production environments.

Reference-contexts: For each arithmetic operation, we define a rule for combining stochastic values based on standard statistical error propagation methods <ref> [Bar78] </ref>. In the following, we assume that all stochastic values are of the form X i a i 3 and represent normal distributions, where X i is the mean and a i is two standard deviations.

Reference-contexts: By assuming that the distributions associated with the stochastic values are normal, we can take advantage of the fact that normal distributions are closed under linear combinations <ref> [LM86] </ref> to define straightforward rules for combining stochastic values. For each arithmetic operation, we define a rule for combining stochastic values based on standard statistical error propagation methods [Bar78].

Reference-contexts: Conventional performance prediction models cannot take advantage of model parameters that are stochastic values. However, knowing the range of values a model parameter may assume can improve the prediction of parallel application behavior within a production system. In <ref> [Sch97] </ref> we defined a performance prediction model representation-called structural modeling-that reflects the time-dependent dynamic mix of application performance activities occurring during execution in a production environment. <p> In the next section we show how normal stochastic data may be used to predict application performance. 2.2 Structural Modeling In this section we define and demonstrate the use of stochastic values as inputs to performance prediction models. We focus on performance prediction models represented as structural models <ref> [Sch97] </ref>. Structural models provide a flexible and adaptable mechanism for predicting application performance in dynamic production systems. By parameterizing such models with stochastic values, we can calculate performance predictions which are also stochastic values.
