Title: A COLLABORATIVE MULTIMEDIA APPLICATION FOR A MOBILE ENVIRONMENT

Abstract: With recent advances in portable computers and wireless networks, it is now feasible to provide sophisticated IT support for a range of mobile workers in areas such as the police, ambulance services and the utilities industries. However, to date, such support has been limited to providing remote access to central facilities such as email and databases. This paper focuses on extending this level of support to include collaborative applications requiring multimedia communications. Such applications make considerable demands on the underlying systems infrastructure. More specifically, the paper discusses the role of such collaborative multimedia applications in supporting field workers in the electricity industry. A prototype conferencing application is described which enables field engineers to jointly view and annotate network diagrams and maps produced by a Geographical Information System. Voice communications is also provided to enable discussions to take place. The underlying distributed systems platform is also presented. The application has been successfully demonstrated over GSM.

Reference-contexts: Such applications involve two or more mobile or fixed users cooperating to achieve a common goal involving the manipulation of information in a range of media types. In particular, these applications often require that continuous media types (e.g. audio) <ref> [Anderson90] </ref> are supported (note that providing support for continuous media types in a mobile environment is an area of increasing research activity [Keeton93, Mah93]). 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Our platform is based on the latter standard. More specifically, the implementation of our platform is based on the ANSAware software suite <ref> [APM93] </ref>. This software suite is itself based on the ANSA architecture which has had a profound influence on the RM-ODP. Thus, the platform realises many of the concepts contained within the RM-ODP while making a number of simplifying assumptions to allow efficient implementation. 4.1.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION The areas of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) <ref> [Baecker93] </ref> and mobile computing [Duchamp94] have become very topical in recent years. However, to date, little research has taken place into the design of CSCW based collaborative applications which are intended to operate in a mobile environment.

Reference-contexts: As with stream interfaces, these parameters can include a specification of the desired throughput, latency and jitter associated with the binding (more details of the specification of QoS parameters for continuous media bindings can be found in <ref> [Coulson95] </ref>). Clients are returned a binding control interface as a result of an explicit bind operation. To control the QoS of the stream once the binding has been established the control interface includes a pair of operations setQoS () and getQoS ().

Underlying Protocols The current execution protocols in ANSAware (i.e. REX and GEX) are not well suited to operate over mobile networks. The problem with the REX protocol is that it takes no account of the characteristics of the underlying network.
