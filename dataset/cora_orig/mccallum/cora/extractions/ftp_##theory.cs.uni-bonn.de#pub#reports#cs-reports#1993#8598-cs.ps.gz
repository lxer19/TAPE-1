Abstract: We present a membership query (i.e. black box interpolation) algorithm for exactly identifying the class of read-once formulas over the basis of boolean threshold functions. We also present a catalogue of generic transformations that can be used to convert an algorithm in one learning model into an algorithm in a different model.

Reference-contexts: This is also shown to hold when equivalence queries are allowed, so MJE (U)!ME (M) also exists. In contrast, we show that the reverse of the MJ!ME transformation does not exist in general.

Reference-contexts: One example is the class of (monotone) read-once formulas over the basis (AND, OR) <ref> [AHK93] </ref>. A formula is read-once if no variable appears more than once. The basis of a formula is the set of operators allowed. <p> Such transformations can be regarded as reductions, in that they reduce the problem of designing an algorithm in one learning model into the problem of designing an algorithm in another learning model. Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski <ref> [AHK93] </ref> applied a generic transformation to convert their algorithm for exactly identifying (i.e. interpolating) the class of monotone read-once formulas over (AND,OR) into a polynomial time membership and equivalence query algorithm for the non-monotone case (read-once formulas over (AND,OR,NOT)). (An equivalence query allows the learner to propose a complete hypothesis for <p> In this paper we present a more extensive set of generic transformations. As in the <ref> [AHK93] </ref> transformation, in these transformations we typically assume the technical condition that the classes being learned are projection closed (a class of functions is projection closed if taking any function in the class and "hard-wiring" a subset of input variables to specific values gives a function that is still in the <p> The membership and equivalence query research began with the above mentioned algorithm for read-once formulas over the (AND,OR,NOT) basis <ref> [AHK93] </ref> and culminated with a polynomial time algorithm to identify read-once formulas over the more general basis of arbitrary symmetric and constant fan-in gates [BHH92b]. <p> However, the algorithm obtained by the transformation is a factor of n less efficient than the one presented in this paper, which is the most efficient known. The first transformation we present, M (M)!MJ (U), is a variation of a simple transformation presented in <ref> [AHK93] </ref>. It converts a membership query algorithm for learning a monotone class into a membership query and justifying assignments algorithm for learning the corresponding unate class. <p> We then present a second transformation, MJ!ME which converts an algorithm for learning a class of formulas in the membership and justifying assignments model, into an algorithm for learning the same class of formulas in the membership and equivalence query model. The main transformation presented in <ref> [AHK93] </ref> is M (M)!ME (U) (Membership query algorithm for monotone class ! Membership and equivalence query algorithm for unate class). By combining the M (M)!MJ (U) transformation with the MJ!ME transformation, we get an M (M)!ME (U) transformation which is slightly different from the one presented in [AHK93]. As in [AHK93], <p> transformation presented in <ref> [AHK93] </ref> is M (M)!ME (U) (Membership query algorithm for monotone class ! Membership and equivalence query algorithm for unate class). By combining the M (M)!MJ (U) transformation with the MJ!ME transformation, we get an M (M)!ME (U) transformation which is slightly different from the one presented in [AHK93]. As in [AHK93], we also show that these transformations can be modified to include equivalence queries in the base and target models of the transformation (i.e. we argue that transformations of the form ME (M)!MJE (U), MJE!ME, and hence ME (M)!ME (U) all exist). <p> <ref> [AHK93] </ref> is M (M)!ME (U) (Membership query algorithm for monotone class ! Membership and equivalence query algorithm for unate class). By combining the M (M)!MJ (U) transformation with the MJ!ME transformation, we get an M (M)!ME (U) transformation which is slightly different from the one presented in [AHK93]. As in [AHK93], we also show that these transformations can be modified to include equivalence queries in the base and target models of the transformation (i.e. we argue that transformations of the form ME (M)!MJE (U), MJE!ME, and hence ME (M)!ME (U) all exist). <p> We conclude with a detailed description of the algorithm and with a theorem stating its correctness and complexity. 3.1 Finding Minterms and Maxterms Our algorithm for learning monotone read-once threshold formulas makes repeated use of the standard greedy procedure (see e.g. <ref> [AHK93] </ref>) for finding minterms of a monotone function f defined on V n , using a membership oracle for f . This procedure Findmin takes as input a subset 5 of variables Q V n containing a minterm of f , and outputs a minterm contained in Q. <p> Proof: The class of read-once threshold formulas is the unate extension of the class of monotone read-once threshold formulas. The theorem follows directly from the results of Angluin, Hellerstein and Karpinski <ref> [AHK93] </ref>, who showed that if a class M can be learned in time O (n ff ) with O (n fi ) membership queries, then the corresponding unate class can be learned in time O (n ff+1 ) with O (n fi+1 ) membership queries, and O (n) equivalence queries. 2 <p> Therefore, if A X 0 = 1 then the sign of X is negative, and if A X 0 = 0 then the sign of X is positive. To determine the sign of X, it therefore suffices to ask the membership query A X 0 . In <ref> [AHK93] </ref>, a simple transformation is presented. It converts an algorithm for learning a monotone class with membership queries into an algorithm for learning the corresponding unate class with membership queries, given the signs of the variables in the target formula as input. <p> A simple variation, handling equivalence queries, is also described. By combining the procedure described above for finding the signs of the variables, with the simple transformation from <ref> [AHK93] </ref> which takes the signs as input, we get a method for transforming an algorithm that identifies a monotone class using membership (and equivalence) queries, into one that identifies the corresponding unate class using membership (and equivalence) queries and justifying assignments. <p> Call ProjBitFlip (V 0 , P , B, S). Set V 0 , P and S to the values W , P 0 and S 0 returned by ProjBitFlip. Applying techniques from <ref> [AHK93] </ref>, we show that a modified version of ToME works if the input algorithm uses equivalence queries as well as membership queries and justifying assignments.

Reference-contexts: We do not know whether these transformations are optimal in the sense that alternate reductions may be discoverable that use fewer queries and less time. Recently an alternate version of the MJ!ME transformation has been developed that uses a factor of log n fewer equivalence queries <ref> [BGHM93] </ref>, but that uses more membership queries and running time. Even assuming we have optimal transformations, for the more difficult transformations we do not know whether optimal algorithms in the base model can yield optimal algorithms in the target model.

Reference-contexts: We note that for some classes of formulas (including the restricted classes of read-once formulas discussed by Goldman, Kearns, and Schapire [GKS90a], and the arithmetic read-once formulas discussed by Bshouty, Hancock, and Hellerstein <ref> [BHH92a] </ref>), justifying assignments can be generated with high probability using random membership queries. For such classes, it is trivial to transform a learning algorithm using membership queries and justifying assignments into an algorithm that interpolates (with high probability) using deterministic and random membership queries.
