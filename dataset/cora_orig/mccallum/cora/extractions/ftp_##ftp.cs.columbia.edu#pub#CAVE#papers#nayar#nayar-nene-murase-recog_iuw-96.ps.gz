Abstract: A real-time vision system is described that can recognize 100 complex three-dimensional objects. In contrast to traditional strategies that rely on object geometry and local image features, the present system is founded on the concept of appearance matching. Appearance manifolds of the 100 objects were automatically learned using a computer-controlled turntable. The entire learning process was completed in 1 day. A recognition loop has been implemented that performs scene change detection, image segmentation, region normalizations, and appearance matching, in less than 1 second. The hardware used by the recognition system includes no more than a CCD color camera and a workstation. The real-time capability and interactive nature of the system have allowed numerous observers to test its performance. To quantify performance, we have conducted controlled experiments on recognition and pose estimation. The recognition rate was found to be 100 % and object pose was estimated with a mean absolute error of 2.02 degrees and standard deviation of 1.67 degrees.

The algorithm we have developed for searching for the closest manifold point in a high-dimensional subspace is described and its complexity discussed.

Reference-contexts: This observation has motivated us to take an extreme approach to visual representation. What we advocate is not a representation of shape but rather appearance <ref> [12] </ref>, encoded in which are brightness variations caused by three-dimensional shape, surface reflectance properties, sensor parameters, and illumination conditions. Given the number of factors at work, it is immediate that an appearance representation that captures all possible variations is simply impractical. <p> Finally, we conclude with experiments that demonstrate the recognition rate and pose estimation accuracy of our system. 2 Appearance Matching: Overview Before we describe the recognition system, we briefly review the notion of parametric appearance matching as introduced in <ref> [12] </ref>. The appearance of an object is the combined effect of its shape, reflectance properties, pose in the scene, and the illumination conditions. While shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties that do not change for any rigid object, pose and illumination vary from one scene to the next. <p> The images of each object are then projected to eigenspace to obtain a set of points. These points lie on a manifold that is parametrized by pose. The manifold is constructed from the discrete points by spline interpolation <ref> [12] </ref>. Each object is stored in the database as a collection of eigenspace points obtained by densely resampling its appearance manifold.

Reference-contexts: The system described here uses the parametric eigenspace representation presented in [14][12]. We assume that the illumination conditions remain more or less constant and hence object pose is the only variable of interest. An analysis of the effect of illumination on the parametric eigenspace can be found in <ref> [17] </ref>. An image set is obtained for each of the 100 objects by varying pose in small increments. Each image is normalized in brightness and scale to achieve invariance to sensor magnification and illumination intensity. Images of all objects (learning samples) are used together to construct an eigenspace.

Will appearance representation suffice? Given the large number of parameters that affect appearance, it does not suggest itself as a replacement for shape representation. <p> The computational complexity is O ( k n ) where n is the number of manifold points and k is the dimensionality of the eigenspace. We have implemented two alternative schemes. The first is an efficient technique for binary search in multiple dimensions <ref> [19] </ref>. This algorithm uses a carefully designed data structure to facilitate quick search through the multidimensional eigenspace in approximately O ( k log 2 n ). off-line as follows. <p> Next, using the forward and backward maps, possible candidates are determined as ones with coordinates that are within * from those of the novel point. Exhaustive search on this short list of candidate points reveals the closest manifold point and the corresponding pose parameter. In <ref> [19] </ref>, code for the above algorithm is given and the algorithm is demonstrated to be easier to implement than most existing ones with similar complexity. In the recognition system, the above search algorithm is applied independently to the three color bands.

This, in turn, makes the computation of eigenspaces both slower and more memory intensive.
