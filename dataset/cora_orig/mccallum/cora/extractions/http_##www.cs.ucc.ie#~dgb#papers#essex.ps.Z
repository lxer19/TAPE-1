Abstract: U.K. In this paper, we present a framework for learning plausible unification-based natural language grammars. We assume that the system will have some initial unification-based grammar [Shi86] [OB93], and we use learning to overcome the incompleteness of this grammar (its , i.e. where it fails to generate strings that humans would regard as grammatical). In contrast to other researchers, we do not believe that formal grammars need be abandoned in favour of stochastic grammars [LF79] [GLS87] [SO90] [LY90] [O'D91] [MM91] [BW92] [Sam87]. We believe that undergeneration can be treated by learning the missing rules. Our approach is to use both model-driven (deductive) and data-driven (inductive) learning. Our framework requires no decision to be made about the balance between being model-driven or data-driven. We can experiment using anything from being purely model-driven to being purely data-driven. We expect the data-driven learning to compensate for weaknesses of the model-driven learning (most notably the problems of incompleteness of the model), and we expect the model-driven learning to compensate for weaknesses of the data-driven learning (most notably the likelihood that data-driven learning will learn a linguistically implausible grammar). The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of our learning framework. Section 3 then describes the model-driven learning, and Section 4 describes data-driven learning. Finally, Section 5 gives some tentative conclusions. We assume that the system has some initial grammar fragment, G, from the outset. Presented with an input string, W, an attempt is made to parse W using G. If this fails, the learning system is invoked. First, the learning system tries to generate rules that, had they been members of G, would have enabled a derivation sequence for W to be found. This is done by trying to extend incomplete derivations using what we call the . The super rule is the following unification grammar rule:
