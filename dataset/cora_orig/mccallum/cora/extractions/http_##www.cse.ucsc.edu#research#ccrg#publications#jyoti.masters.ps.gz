Reference-contexts: The advantage of using these algorithms is that they provide delay bounds for isochronous traffic. At the other end of the spectrum in single-channel MAC protocols are random-access protocols like (ALOHA) <ref> [Abr70] </ref>, Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) [TK75a], Multiple Access Collision Avoidance (MACA) [Kar90], MACA for Wireless (MACAW) [VBZ94] and Floor Acquisition Multiple Access (FAMA) [FGLA97]. These protocols require every station to contend for the channel if there is traffic to send. <p> We aimed at analyzing the increase in throughput due to correct channel/code assignment, the scalability of the algorithm and its adaptivity to mobility. Finally, Chapter 7 presents our conclusions and ideas for future work. 4 2. Background 2.1 Random-Access Protocols The ALOHA protocol <ref> [Abr70] </ref> was one of the first random-access protocols to be used in wireless communication. This protocol allows stations to transmit any time they desire.

Reference-contexts: An improvement over pure ALOHA is to synchronize the channel by slotting time into segments whose duration is exactly equal to the time for transmission of a single packet. This is know as slotted ALOHA <ref> [Abr73, KL73] </ref>. Since each station starts packets only at the beginning of a slot, when packets conflict, it is ensured that they will overlap completely rather than partially, providing an increase in channel efficiency.

Reference-contexts: Here, quasi-orthogonal codes are assigned to transmitters in a packet-radio network in such a way that hidden terminal interference is eliminated. A bound on the minimum number of codes for correct code assignments is derived. Code assignment was proven to be NP-hard in the paper by Bertossi and Bonuccelli <ref> [BB95] </ref>. Hu presented a technique using pairwise code assignment in which both the transmitter and receiver are assigned the same code. This thesis presents a distributed channel/code assignment algorithm.

Reference-contexts: There are a wide variety of single-channel MAC protocols. These include schemes, based on fixed channel assignment like FDMA and TDMA <ref> [BG94] </ref>. In FDMA the share of the channel consists of a narrow frequency band and in TDMA the share consists of a time slot.

Reference-contexts: Thickness is a measure of planarity. It is defined as the minimum number of planar graphs a given graph can be split into. However, their algorithms are not distributed and work only for an one-time schedule. All the methods described above create schedules based on topology. Chlamtac and Farago <ref> [CF94] </ref> presented an algorithm which is independent of the detailed topology. Instead, the schedule depends on global parameters like, the number of nodes and maximum degree a node can have. Transmitter-oriented code assignment is introduced by Makansi [Mak87].

Reference-contexts: However, all solutions for getting a TDMA cycle can be mapped onto the problem of assigning the least number of frequencies correctly in a network, because the requirements for a solution are similar. Chlamtac and Kutten <ref> [CK85] </ref> presented one of the first papers to address the problem of creating a TDMA cycle in a multi-hop network.

Reference-contexts: This work was further extended in a later paper, where they presented the distributed version of their protocol <ref> [CK87] </ref>; the distributed version uses a traveling token, which incurs more overhead traffic on the network. Since they set up a static schedule, they 9 are able to bound the delay a broadcast packet will suffer before it reaches all stations in a network.

Reference-contexts: The second algorithm builds a link schedule that meets a prescribed end-to-end demand in a schedule of smallest length. A different approach by Cidon and Sidi consists of using control segments during which the schedule for the transmission segments is decided <ref> [CS88] </ref>; in their model secondary conflicts are not permitted unlike the model by Hajek and Sasaki, where only primary conflicts are taken into consideration.

Reference-contexts: The number of messages generated are also proportional to the square of the degree of the network. Simulations of the algorithm were done in CPT.

Ephremides and Truong <ref> [ET90] </ref> presented a distributed solution to the scheduling problem requiring stations to exchange schedules and require each station to know the schedule of stations one-hop and two-hops away. Ramanathan and Lloyd mapped the TDMA cycle problem to the graph coloring problem [RL93].

Reference-contexts: Nodes process messages they receive in FIFO order and links transmit packets in the FIFO order. We also assume a MAC protocol that informs CADA of the code it hears the neighbors using. The floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA) family of protocols <ref> [FG95] </ref> is the example we use to illustrate the use of CADA with a MAC protocol. In FAMA, a sender transmits a request-to-send (RTS) to the receiver, which in turn transmits a clear-to-send (CTS) if it obtains the RTS free of errors.

A key advantage of these contention-based MAC protocols is that they require very little synchronization and no centralized control. <p> MACA [Kar90] was a CSMA/CA protocol that did not use carrier sensing, just like the ALOHA-based variation of SRMA. MACAW [VBZ94] is a variation of MACA with better retransmission strategies. However, both MACA and MACAW suffer from hidden-terminal interference, as proven in <ref> [FGLA97] </ref>. FAMA-NCS [FGLA97] solves the hidden-terminal problem in multihop networks. This is done by using CSMA/CA and using a CTS lasting much longer than the RTS.

Reference-contexts: Information about the transmission codes is disseminated using the control messages and not tokens or any such mechanism prone to failure. The algorithm was shown to be correct and its complexity was analyzed <ref> [GLAR97] </ref>. The storage requirement of the algorithm is very small typically proportional to the square of the degree of the network. The number of messages generated are also proportional to the square of the degree of the network. Simulations of the algorithm were done in CPT.

Reference-contexts: Since they set up a static schedule, they 9 are able to bound the delay a broadcast packet will suffer before it reaches all stations in a network. Hajek and Sasaki presented two algorithms for obtaining fixed schedules in a spread spectrum network <ref> [HS88] </ref>. Their first algorithm finds a schedule of minimum length that allows each pair of neighboring stations to converse for a prescribed length of time. The second algorithm builds a link schedule that meets a prescribed end-to-end demand in a schedule of smallest length.

Reference-contexts: The number of transmission codes is smaller than the number of nodes, and senders and receivers must agree on which transmission code to use in a way that avoids interference as much as possible. This means that stations two hops away from each other need to use different codes <ref> [Hu93] </ref>. Both the channel-assignment and code-assignment problems can be mapped onto the two-hop node coloring problem of a graph. Chapter 2 presents a brief survey of random-access protocols and previous work done in the area of dynamic channel or code allocation. <p> The node should not have a code in common with any of its two-hop neighbors. Thus, it is clear that we require d (d 1) + 1 25 codes. This is a sufficient condition to obtain valid code assignments <ref> [Hu93] </ref>. The network can still operate with fewer than d (d 1) + 2, even though some two-hop neighbors have the same codes. However, for the proof, we assume that d (d 1) + 2 codes exist.

The data transfer can be done on the receiver's code for ROCA or on the transmitter's code for TOCA. The advantage of some form of code assignment is that a node does not require all other nodes in its one-hop neighborhood to be silent while it receives a transmission.

Reference-contexts: Using CDMA in packet-radio networks permits multiple stations within range of the same receivers to transmit concurrently and without interference as long as the stations do not have the same code. Several multi-access protocols have been proposed and commercial systems have been deployed that take advantage of CDMA <ref> [Ric] </ref>. An important design consideration in a multihop packet-radio network using CDMA is the assignment of transmission codes to network nodes. CDMA has mainly been used in cellular networks in which a base station takes on the task of assigning codes.

Reference-contexts: Using a wide bandwidth reduces multipath fading because of the frequency diversity achieved. It also increases tolerance to jamming and narrow band interference. CDMA comes in two forms. In the frequency hopping (FH) systems the total bandwidth is partitioned into a set of channels of equal bandwidth <ref> [RKM95] </ref>. In this scheme, each stations is assigned a hopping pattern corresponding to its code. Both the transmitter and the receiver dwell on the same channel and hop together to another channel afterwards while talking to each other.

Reference-contexts: Ephremides and Truong [ET90] presented a distributed solution to the scheduling problem requiring stations to exchange schedules and require each station to know the schedule of stations one-hop and two-hops away. Ramanathan and Lloyd mapped the TDMA cycle problem to the graph coloring problem <ref> [RL93] </ref>. They also provided polynomial algorithms that improved the TDMA cycle length. In their analysis, the length of the schedule depends on the thickness of the network and not on the maximum degree of the network, as was the case in earlier papers. Thickness is a measure of planarity.

Reference-contexts: The spreading codes are the most important aspect of CDMA technology. The codes are Walsh codes based on a 64fi64 Walsh matrix. Multiple transmissions can be separated using coding theory as explained below <ref> [Tan96] </ref>. In DS-CDMA each bit time is subdivided into m short intervals called chips. Each station is assigned a unique m-bit code or chip sequence. To transmit a 1 bit, a station sends its chip sequence or code.

An important assumption used here is that the propagation delay on the channel is much smaller than a packet transmission time.

Reference-contexts: In the presence of hidden terminals performance of CSMA degrades to that of ALOHA. One of the first solutions to the hidden terminal problem was the BTMA <ref> [TK75b] </ref> protocol. This protocol required each wireless terminal to be within line-of-sight of a base station. The base station transmits a busy tone on a channel different from the data channel. Thus, every terminal has to listen to the channel on which the busy tone is sent, before transmitting.
