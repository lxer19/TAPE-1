Reference-contexts: Introduction Traditionally, the decision problem for first-order logic is studied for classes of formulas characterized by the quantifier prefix and/or signature restrictions (see e.g. the recent book of Borger Gradel and Gurevich <ref> [1] </ref>). Kozen [4] considered the decision problem for so-called positive first-order formulas. Recently, in connection with model building, some decidability results have been obtained for classes of formulas characterized in terms of the clause form of the formula (e.g. Fermuller and Leitsch [2, 3]).

In this paper we study the complexity of the validity problem for the class of ground-negative formulas which is a natural generalization of a class of formulas considered by Kozen [4]. <p> It is interesting that the complexity of the validity problem for ground-negative formulas does not change when equality, function symbols and universal quantifier are not allowed in formulas. The decidability of ground-negative formulas is also established by Fermuller and Leitsch <ref> [3] </ref>. They prove that this class of formulas (and even a more general class) can be decided by hyper-resolution with ordered paramodulation. Their proof does not give our complexity bounds since proofs by hyperresolution and ordered paramodulation require exponential space.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Traditionally, the decision problem for first-order logic is studied for classes of formulas characterized by the quantifier prefix and/or signature restrictions (see e.g. the recent book of Borger Gradel and Gurevich [1]). Kozen <ref> [4] </ref> considered the decision problem for so-called positive first-order formulas.

In this paper we study the complexity of the validity problem for the class of ground-negative formulas which is a natural generalization of a class of formulas considered by Kozen <ref> [4] </ref>. We show that this problem is p 2 -complete both for logics with and without equality, which is a quite unusual complexity class for natural fragments of first-order logic. <p> In this paper we shall also consider the satisfiability problem for ground-positive clauses. We shall use several statements proven by Kozen <ref> [4] </ref>. Lemma 1.4 (Kozen [4], theorem 9) The following problem is NP-complete for logics with equality. <p> In this paper we shall also consider the satisfiability problem for ground-positive clauses. We shall use several statements proven by Kozen <ref> [4] </ref>. Lemma 1.4 (Kozen [4], theorem 9) The following problem is NP-complete for logics with equality. Given a conjunction L of ground literals and a positive formula ', is the formula L ' valid? It is easy to prove that this problem is also NP-complete for logic without equality. 3 Section 2. <p> The domain of M is the set of ground terms of . The interpretation of terms is defined in such a way that any term r is interpreted by r. The only atoms true in M are atoms in A. Lemma 3.3 (Kozen <ref> [4] </ref>, lemma 4) For any (^; _; 9)-sentence ' the sentence A ' is valid if and only if M A j= '. 1 Let be the signature consisting of three predicates and , not 1 and not 2 and a countably infinite number of constants t; f; c 1 ; <p> Proof. It is enough to note that the function G 7! G t is polynomial-time computable and apply Lemmas 3.2 and 3.6. 2 Note that our reduction can be modified to prove a result that is similar to Lemma 1.4 (theorem 9 of Kozen <ref> [4] </ref>) but for logic without equality: Theorem 1 The following problem is NP-complete for logic without equality. <p> Theorem 2 The validity problem for ground-negative formulas, with or without equality and with or without function symbols is p 2 -complete. The proof of Theorem 2 also establishes a statement similar to Lemma 1.4 (theorem 9 of Kozen <ref> [4] </ref>): Theorem 3 The following problem is p 2 -complete, both for logics with and without equality and with or without function symbols.

According to a standard characterization of p 2 (see e.g. Papadimitriou <ref> [5] </ref>) in terms of polynomial size witnesses we have that the validity problem for ground-negative formulas is in p Of course, this lemma also holds for formulas without equality. 5 Section 3. p 2 -hardness Section 3 2 -hardness In this section we prove that the validity problem for ground-negative formulas <p> If this instance is true we say that this quantified boolean formula is valid. The following fact is well-known (see e.g. Papadimitriou <ref> [5] </ref>). Lemma 3.2 QBF 2 is p 2 -complete. Let A be a conjunction of ground atoms without equality in a signature having at least one constant. The least Herbrand model of A in , denoted M A , is defined as follows.
