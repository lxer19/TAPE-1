Reference-contexts: Currently, there is no standard or well-developed method for information agent evaluation. Basically, an information agent is retrieving Hypertext information intelligently. However, there is no standard for Hypertext information retrieval either. Traditional information retrieval (IR) evaluation standard using precision and recall are difficult to adapt <ref> [ Agosti and Smeaton 1996] </ref>, especially when there is no obvious method to calculate recall. Due to these reasons, our evaluation is not complete. Some results are given below. We evaluated our text parser and suburb learner using traditional IR evaluation standards.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The amount of information on the Internet is increasing dramatically, making efficient information retrieval very difficult. Information agents use artificial intelligence technology to support intelligent web access. One main group of information agents is browsing assistant agents or interface agents, such as Letizia [Lieberman 1995] and WebWatcher <ref> [Armstrong et al. 1995] </ref>, which learn from users behavior or feedback, detect users interests and assist browsing. Another major agent group is search assistant agents that search the Web automatically and carry out users specific information retrieval tasks.

Reference-contexts: CASA is a knowledge-based system. Apart from the knowledge base, it has three main parts: the text parser, the learning machine and the retrieval cycle. CASA is implemented in Eclipse Prolog as Eclipse has the HTTP library which provides basic functions for developing WWW applications <ref> [Bonnet et al. 1996] </ref>. 4 Search Based on Partial Understanding Traditional keyword search based Information Retrieval (IR) methods, which treat text as bags of unordered words, have two major problems. One is that one word may have many meanings and 4 this reduces the precision rate.

Reference-contexts: Another major agent group is search assistant agents that search the Web automatically and carry out users specific information retrieval tasks. Some examples are BargainFinder [Krulwich 1996] , FAQ Finder <ref> [Burke et al. 1997] </ref> and CiFi [Loke et al. 1996]. Our research focuses on building a knowledge-based search assistant agent for one specific domain: online real estate advertisement search. <p> It should be pointed out that our test was limited in scope and coverage. Further evaluation on more sites with a larger variety of advertisements will be conducted in the future. 8 Related work The closest work to CASA is an agent called RentMe <ref> [Burke et al. 1997] </ref>, which is a knowledge-based system that browses real estate advertisements on the Internet. It differs from CASA in that it is a browsing assistant agent that uses case based reasoning to detect users interests, whereas CASA is a rule-based and goal-driven search agent. <p> They both aim to 14 filter and deliver advertisements according to users profiles. Unfortunately, not much information is available on their Web pages. There has been research on knowledge-based information agents. Some examples are FAQ Finder <ref> [Burke et al. 1997] </ref>, Internet Fish [LaMacchia 1996] and CiFi [Loke et al. 1996] .

Reference-contexts: (e.g. the average price replaces the query price, or the query price is brought closer to the average price), and a suburb name is replaced by the name of a nearby suburb. 7 Evaluation CASA has fulfilled or partially fulfilled most of the criteria in Etzionis definition for software agents <ref> [ Etzioni and Weld 1995] </ref>, such as autonomy, temporal continuity, communication ability and adaptability. One extra feature CASA has is knowledge acquisition. The features it does not have are mobility and personality. Currently, there is no standard or well-developed method for information agent evaluation.

Reference-contexts: CASA currently monitors two web site. One is Newsclassifieds [Newsclassifieds 1997] that contains advertisements from 27 Australian newspapers. The other is Fairfax market <ref> [Fairfax 1997] </ref> that collects advertisements from 6 top Australian newspapers. The two sites are accessed alternately. If the server is busy, CASA will wait and try again.

Reference-contexts: Then, future retrieval is based on knowledge unit matching rather than key word matching. The knowledge unit representation and the text parsing algorithm is presented in Section 4. From our preliminary research <ref> [Gao and Sterling 1997] </ref>, we found that we needed a suburb database to improve text parsing accuracy and price statistics to improve the search performance (e.g. to guide price refinement). A static database and handcrafted price statistics cannot cope with the dynamic environment.

Reference-contexts: It differs from CASA in that it is a browsing assistant agent that uses case based reasoning to detect users interests, whereas CASA is a rule-based and goal-driven search agent. Regarding the application domain, the other two projects on online classified advertisement search are Ineeda <ref> [Ineeda 1997] </ref>, which is a project by Australian Newsclassifieds, and Cybergold [CyberGold 1996], which is an American classified advertisements service. They both aim to 14 filter and deliver advertisements according to users profiles. Unfortunately, not much information is available on their Web pages.

Apart from a different application domain, CASA differs from these agents in that it uses information extraction technology to enable search based on partial understanding, it has knowledge acquisition ability, and it views information retrieval as a cycle.

Both are agents that learn from Internet documents based on a small amount of domain knowledge. However their learning methods and aims are quite different from our work. ILA uses a context-free algorithm to translate information sources into its own internal concepts.

Reference-contexts: Small knowledge units can be clustered to form larger knowledge units such as real estate ad, paragraph and document. The main challenge is to extract knowledge units from text. Related previous work dates back to Schanks primitive-act frame system in the 1970s <ref> [Winston 1984] </ref>. However, our work differs from others in that it introduces the knowledge unit representation using three kinds of constraints and the parsing algorithm consisting of three steps. Our method not only concerns the text but also the HTML tags and other structures.
