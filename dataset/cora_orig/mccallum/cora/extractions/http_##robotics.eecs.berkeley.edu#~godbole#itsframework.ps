Abstract: We have developed a five-layer model, tool, and task hierarchy called Hierarchical Assessment and Requirements Tools for Crash Avoidance Systems (HARTCAS). The hierarchy is discussed in general terms and illustrated by analysis of a forward collision warning system. We show how to quantify benefits, the relationships between the effectiveness of a warning and the probability that the warning is a nuisance. In this context, three human detection models are described, and their use is demonstrated. A general modeling theory for the performance of crash avoidance systems is proposed and partially developed. We conclude by discussing further needs for modeling, tool development, and collection of experimental data.
