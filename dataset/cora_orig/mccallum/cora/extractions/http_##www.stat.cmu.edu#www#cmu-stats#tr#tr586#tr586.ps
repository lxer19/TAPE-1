Reference-contexts: Simple error estimates of this type are often conservative (they are usually a better estimate for the error in B 0 (f )) and sometimes unreliable. If combined with results from other basic rules they can be made more robust <ref> (Berntsen, Espelid and Genz, 1991a) </ref>, but the effect of these more sophisticated techniques is usually an even more conservative estimate.

Reference-contexts: For integrands with a dominant peak, one possible general transformation method is based on the assumption <ref> (Chen, 1985) </ref> that the factor ~ L () is approximately multivariate normal. This means ~ L () ' Ke 1 2 () t 1 () with = ~ and K being the normalizing constant. Here, it is advisable to initially transform the variables to improve this approximation.

Reference-contexts: The Monte Carlo integration method used for all of our tests is an antithetic variate enhanced version of crude Monte Carlo. With this standard technique <ref> (see Davis and Rabinowitz, 1984 or Evans and Swartz, 1992) </ref> for improving the convergence of crude Monte Carlo, for every random point z*[0; 1] m at which we sample the transformed integrand, we also sample at the point (1; 1; :::; 1)z.

Reference-contexts: We should acknowledge that all of our examples involve calculation of normalizing constants and expectations. These are important and sometimes challenging problems <ref> (e.g., DiCiccio, Kass, Raftery, and Wasserman, 1997) </ref>, but marginal densities are often of interest as well. Although the method described here should be applicable, there are implementation issues that would need further attention before it could be applied effectively to marginal density calculation.

Reference-contexts: From a theoretical point of view, if we want convergence of a sequence of integration rules to the integral of a continuous function, it is necessary that the sum of the absolute values of the integration rule weights remain bounded <ref> (Engels, 1980, Chapter 4) </ref>. This condition, for an integration rule sequence based on increasing d, has not been established for many of the non-product polynomial integrating rules.

Reference-contexts: This would be equivalent to using the split-t distributions as importance functions for Monte Carlo integration. Viewed in that light, our algorithm for choosing split-t distributions is a modification of that used by Geweke (1989) <ref> (see also Evans, 1991) </ref>, and we believe it will be useful in that role.

Reference-contexts: In applications there are often many such integrals, for various 1 alternative choices of g (), that need to be evaluated. Many other strategies for integration are available, especially in Bayesian analysis <ref> (see Evans and Swartz, 1995, for an overview) </ref>. Our investigation of subregion-adaptive integration was motivated by the need for a method that would be generally applicable and efficient in reasonably well-behaved problems.

Reference-contexts: Conservativeness in software like DCUHRE is needed to maintain a relatively high level of reliability for a broad range of integrands, but for better-behaved problems the error estimation strategy should be modified. An approach that has shown promise on several different problems <ref> (see Genz and Kass, 1991) </ref> is to use a combination of the conservative error estimates from the adaptive software, and differences between integral estimates from successive calls to the software.

Reference-contexts: The development of software to perform the analyses presented here is nearly complete. This software includes other transformations (such as unsplit multivariate Student-t) and other numerical integration methods such as adaptive importance sampling, modified Gauss-Hermite <ref> (Genz and Keister, 1996) </ref> and spherical-radial integration (Monahan and Genz, 1996a,b). The software will be made available through standard public domain internet sources, including statlib. Work on constructing a version for use with the S statistical computing environment is also underway.

Reference-contexts: This avoids underflow problems that can occur with some statistical problems. 4.1 A One Dimensional Example In this section we consider the computation of integrals using a Pearson Type IV density function <ref> (see Johnson and Kotz, 1970, p. 12) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We will compare subregion-adaptive methods with importance sampled Monte Carlo in the examples of Section 4. We note that it will be important to obtain good numerical approximations for both the mode and the modal covariance matrix <ref> (Kass, 1987) </ref> since the completion of the transformation construction process, and the stable evaluation of the posterior at the integration points, depend on these quantities. 3.1 The Modal Approximation Transformation The use of a transformation of variables can be viewed as a method of preconditioning the integrand so that the transformed

Reference-contexts: A feature of these low M rules is that the weights w i are not always positive. While this has been perceived by some statisticians <ref> (see Shaw, 1988a and 1988b and Dellaportas and Wright, 1991) </ref> as an obstacle to using these rules with positive integrands, the results presented in the examples given at the end of this paper do not support this perception.
