Abstract: For complex perceptual tasks that are characterized by object occlusion and non-stationarity, recognition systems with adaptive signal processing front-ends have been developed. These systems rely on hand-crafted symbolic object models, which constitutes a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. We propose an approach to automate object model acquisition that relies on the detection and resolution of signal processing and interpretation discrepancies. The approach is applied to the task of acquiring acoustic-event models for the Sound

Reference-contexts: However, at the contour level, a data-expectation discrepancy would be flagged because the data would not support a simple explanation. In addition, data-data discrepancy would also be flagged by the STFT-Wigner discrepancy detection process <ref> [ Bitar et al., 1992 ] </ref> indicating a time resolution problem.

Reference-contexts: However, the dimensions of time and frequency are orthogonal: the STFT algorithm [ Nawab and Quatieri, 1988 ] trades off resolution along the time dimension with that of frequency. The Wigner algorithm <ref> [ Claasen and Meclenbrauker, 1980 ] </ref> introduces cross terms which obscure relevant information when a source is composed of multiple frequency components. Under such circumstances it becomes necessary to combine the "views" or SPA-correlates to generate a more composite representation of the object. <p> It indicates a need for SPA/parameter adaptation. For instance, Bitar et al [ 1992 ] describe the use of the Pseudo-Wigner Distribution (PWD) <ref> [ Claasen and Meclenbrauker, 1980 ] </ref> in conjunction with the STFT [ Nawab and Quatieri, 1988 ] to detect inadequacies of time and frequency resolution. 5.2 Data-Expectation discrepancy A data-expectation discrepancy is encountered when signal processing results do not support expectations.

Reference-contexts: When the feature set is determined to be insufficient, the domain expert intervenes to suggest alternate/additional features. Vadala [ 1992 ] presents an approach for acquiring models of sounds in the context of the SUT <ref> [ Lesser et al., 1993 ] </ref> , an adaptive perceptual system for non-speech sound recognition. <p> Since some parameterizations of an SPA expose certain salient features while obscuring others, it is useful to compare the SPA-correlates obtained under different parameterizations of an SPA. This is possible using knowledge of the underlying signal processing theory which forms the basis of the SPA implementation <ref> [ Lesser et al., 1993 ] </ref> . For instance, consider the analysis of time-amplitude waveform data corresponding to an acoustic-event composed of two constant-frequency components with an inter-component spacing of 15 Hz. <p> When evidence for the presence lower level models accumulates, expectations for higher level models can be posted thus recursively supporting search effort. 5 Discrepancies and Diagnosis In this section, we discuss discrepancy detection and diagnosis <ref> [ Lesser et al., 1993 ] </ref> , which form the backbone of our learning approach. Discrepancies fall into three categories: data-data, data-expectation, and model-model. Their occurance indicates inappropriate data processing. We discuss diagnosis, the process of explaining why a certain discrepancy may have occurred, with respect to the discrepancies. <p> Default Processing Context: same as before. Assumption: Model database contains only the models for Steady-1, Steady-2 and Chirp. We examine the sequence of events that would ensue during a SUT recognition run operating in Configuration II <ref> [ Lesser et al., 1993 ] </ref> . The spectral data obtained on STFT analysis is grouped over time into spectral-activity bands, which are used to index into the model database. For the given scenario, spectral activity is restricted to a single band that indexes both Steady-1 and Steady-2.

Reference-contexts: To summarize, the above rely on human intervention to initialize critical parameters and/or suggest alternate features to extract when feature inadequacies are encountered. In the domain of vision, TRIPLE <ref> [ Ming and Bhanu, 1990 ] </ref> learns models for aircraft identification when presented two dimensional images. The features used in the individual concepts are subsets of a fixed set of features (or SPA parameterizations) determined to be sufficient for the class of objects.

Reference-contexts: With a sampling frequency of 8 KHz, a Fourier Transform based algorithm for frequency analysis would be unable to expose the relevant frequency detail unless a data window that affords the minimum required frequency resolution is used. This is illustrated using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) algorithm <ref> [ Nawab and Quatieri, 1988 ] </ref> for spectral analysis in Figure 3. Note that the uncertainty in frequency spread i.e., "width" of each component reduces when the data is processed with greater frequency resolution. frequency components, processed with (a) shorter and (b) longer STFT window. <p> For instance, consider the analysis of a near-linear rising chirp 2 sound sampled at a frequency of 8KHz. If the signal data is processed for spectral content using the STFT algorithm <ref> [ Nawab and Quatieri, 1988 ] </ref> with a small window and narrow decimation (128 and 64 data points respectively) and then contouring applied, we would obtain results as shown in Figure 4a. <p> Occassionally, as in the case of a sound event composed of parallel chirps, both good time and frequency resolution must be obtained in order to identify all the salient time and frequency characteristics. However, the dimensions of time and frequency are orthogonal: the STFT algorithm <ref> [ Nawab and Quatieri, 1988 ] </ref> trades off resolution along the time dimension with that of frequency. The Wigner algorithm [ Claasen and Meclenbrauker, 1980 ] introduces cross terms which obscure relevant information when a source is composed of multiple frequency components. <p> It indicates a need for SPA/parameter adaptation. For instance, Bitar et al [ 1992 ] describe the use of the Pseudo-Wigner Distribution (PWD) [ Claasen and Meclenbrauker, 1980 ] in conjunction with the STFT <ref> [ Nawab and Quatieri, 1988 ] </ref> to detect inadequacies of time and frequency resolution. 5.2 Data-Expectation discrepancy A data-expectation discrepancy is encountered when signal processing results do not support expectations.

Reference-contexts: Time savings are expected with any knowledge intensive approach as opposed to a pure search process. We will shortly be collecting timing data for model acquisition using DiMac and generalized time frequency compute intensive approach <ref> [ Jones and Parks, 1990 ] </ref> for determining the most appropriate processing parameters.
