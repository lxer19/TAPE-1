Abstract: Initially, Internet protocols were not designed for mobility nor were they designed for handling real-time services. Recent research efforts on Mobile-IP and RSVP are aimed at providing these features in the Internet. However, additional support is needed to provide real-time services for moving users. One such real-time service for mobile users is the concept of an Internet Cellular Phone. An IP based backbone network capable of delivering packetized voice to moving users.

Reference-contexts: Also, the problem of mapping existing cellular services as IP services is an interesting research issue. For example, the problem of providing a cellular conference call using Mobile IP Multicast <ref> (Acharya et al. 1996) </ref>. Providing integrated services in the Internet to moving users allows additional capabilities: simultaneously receiving e-mail while talking on the Internet Cellular Phone using the same network. Recent research efforts in Mobile-IP are aimed at supporting mobility in the c flIFIP 1997.

Handoff interacts with reallocation of resources, degradation of service and resource reservations. * Protocol integration: IPv6 (Deering et al. 1995) contains some unique features that provide some useful facilities to route data packets to mobile hosts efficiently (Perkins et al. 1996).

Reference-contexts: The edge network consists of base stations supporting IP cell phones or devices that can send and receive packetized voice and the backbone is the Internet. The base stations are connected to routers that support Mobile-IP routing <ref> (Perkins et al. 1996) </ref> and reservation protocols to guarantee service quality to moving users. Why an Internet cellular phone? Here's why? We believe that determining the support protocols needed in the Internet to provide real-time service guarantees to moving users is a significant research problem. <p> Handoff interacts with reallocation of resources, degradation of service and resource reservations. * Protocol integration: IPv6 (Deering et al. 1995) contains some unique features that provide some useful facilities to route data packets to mobile hosts efficiently <ref> (Perkins et al. 1996) </ref>.

This architecture describes the service classes, admission control schemes, a reservation protocol, MRSVP, which is an extension of RSVP to handle mobile users, and the handoff management schemes. In this architecture, there are two service classes, mobility independent and mobility dependent. <p> In addition to features already present in RSVP, MRSVP protocol <ref> (Talukdar et al. 1997) </ref> requires several additional fea 4 IPv6 + MOBILE-IP + MRSVP = Internet Cellular Phone? tures; e.g., active and passive reservation, reservation by proxy agents to make spatial reservations for the different classes of services to mobile users.
