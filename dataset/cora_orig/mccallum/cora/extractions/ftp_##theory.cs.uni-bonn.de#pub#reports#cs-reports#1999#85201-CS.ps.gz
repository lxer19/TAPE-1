Reference-contexts: Another interesting related question to which probably can be studied by the method of this paper is deciding irreducibility of sparse polynomials. Unfortunately for irreducibility there is no analogue of the discriminant characterization of square-freeness.

Unfortunately we do not know any nontrvial upper bounds for the aforementioned problems.

Therefore, from Theorem 2 we obtain the following statement. Corollary 2. <p> However, for sparse polynomial with fixed number of monomial we do not have the corresponding NP-hardness result for computing gcd (f; g).
