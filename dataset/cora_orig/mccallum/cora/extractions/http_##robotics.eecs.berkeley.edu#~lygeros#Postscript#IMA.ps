Reference-contexts: Then we have the following identities. 1. Bilinearity (av + bw) g = a (v g) + b (w g) 2. v (f ^ r) = (v f ) + (1) m f ^ (v g) Proof. See Abraham et al. <ref> [1, page 429] </ref>. Theorem 16. Let a 1 ; : : : ; a n be a basis for V . <p> Let T : V ! W be a linear transformation. If f is an alternating tensor on W then T fl f is an alternating tensor on V , and T fl (f ^ g) = T fl f ^ T fl g Proof. See Abraham et. al. <ref> [1, page 420] </ref>. 2.1.8. Algebras and Ideals. In Sections 2.1.5 and 2.1.6, we introduced the wedge product and interior product and demonstrated some of their properties. We now look more closely at the algebraic structure these operations impart to the space of alternating tensors. <p> Before doing this, we need to review some basic facts from differential geometry. The reader may wish to consult numerous books on the subject such as <ref> [1, 20, 31] </ref>. 2.2.1. Differentiable Manifolds. Definition 22. A manifold M of dimension n is a metric space 3 which is locally homeomorphic to R n . A simple example of a manifold is R n itself. Other examples are the circle S 1 and the sphere S 2 . <p> The natural way to do this is by defining a map f fl : T p M ! T q N by for smooth functions g in the neighborhood of q. One can easily check <ref> [1] </ref> that f fl (X p ) is a linear operator and a derivation and thus a tangent vector. The map f fl : T p M ! T f (p) N is called the push forward map of f . Proposition 25. <p> 1 ; : : : ; u s in some neighborhood U with 2r + s + 1 = dim M such that ff = dz + 2 i=1 and therefore dz = 2 i=1 Given any two points p; q 2 U we must find integral curves c : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! U with c (0) = p and c (1) = q. Since we are working locally, we can assume that the initial point p is the origin: z (p) = x i (p) = y i (p) = u i (p) = 0.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the derived flag must be recomputed for every choice of . 4.2.4. The Infinitesimal Brunovsky Form. An altogether different approach to dynamic feedback linearization is presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. It revolves around an alternative flag construction that can be used to derive a special normal form, the Infinitesimal Brunovsky Form. An interesting fact about this construction is that any accessible nonlinear system can be brought into this form. <p> The importance of this flag is highlighted by the following theorems: Proposition 63. The following statements are equivalent: 1. The system (181) satisfies the strong accessibility rank condition 2. Any non-zero form has finite relative degree 3. H 1 = f0g Proof. In <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 64. Suppose H 1 = f0g. <p> The forms f! (j) i ; 1 i m; j 0g are linearly independent. In particular, P m i=1 r i = n. Proof. In <ref> [2] </ref>. An equivalent form of the Theorem 64 is the following: Corollary 65. Suppose H 1 = f0g. <p> Proof. In <ref> [2] </ref>. The last representation, called the Infinitesimal Brunovsky form, highlights the similarity of this construction with the regular Brunovsky form: the two forms are identical, with scalar quantities replaced by one forms. Using this normal form the following theorems can be proved: Theorem 66. <p> The system (181) is linearizable by static state feedback if and only if H 1 = f0g and for all k = 1; : : : ; k fl , H k is integrable. 82 G. PAPPAS, J. LYGEROS, D. TILBURY, AND S. SASTRY Proof. In <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 67. Suppose H 1 = f0g and let = (! 1 ; : : : ; ! m ) T . <p> There exists a system of linearizing outputs y = h (x; u; : : : ; u (-1) ) 2 R m if and only if there exist an invertible polynomial operator P 2 K mfim fi d dt such that d (P ) = 0. Proof. In <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.2.5. Connection between the approaches. We now consider some results where dynamic feedback linearization is successful as opposed to static feedback linearization. A simple calculation reveals the following: Proposition 68. Consider system (180). <p> Proof. The result follows from the above proposition. In fact Corollary 69 also holds for general dynamic feedback. Theorem 70. The following statements are equivalent: 1. System (181) with m = 1 is static feedback linearizable 2. System (181) with m = 1 is dynamic feedback linearizable Proof. See <ref> [6, 2] </ref>. In other words, dynamic state feedback is only helpful in the case of multi-input systems or Pfaffian systems with codimension greater than two. The proof for Theorem 70 can be found in [6] for the vector field formalism and in [2] for the infinitesimal Brunovsky form formalism. <p> See [6, 2]. In other words, dynamic state feedback is only helpful in the case of multi-input systems or Pfaffian systems with codimension greater than two. The proof for Theorem 70 can be found in [6] for the vector field formalism and in <ref> [2] </ref> for the infinitesimal Brunovsky form formalism. It should be noted here that the second proof is extremely simple whereas the vector field proof is rather complicated.

Reference-contexts: The early theory in this area sprung from the work of Darboux, Lie, Engel, Pfaff, Carnot and Caratheodory on the structure of systems with non-integrable linear constraints on the velocities of their configuration variables, the so-called nonholonomic control systems (for a good development of this see <ref> [3] </ref>). This was followed by the work of Goursat and Cartan, which is considered to contain some of the finest achievements of the mid-part of this century on exterior differential systems. <p> Let r be the smallest integer such that () r+1 ^ ! 1 ^ ^ ! s = 0 Then the retracting space C (I ) is of dimension 2r + s. 20 G. PAPPAS, J. LYGEROS, D. TILBURY, AND S. SASTRY Proof. See Bryant et al. <ref> [3, pages 11-12] </ref>. 2.2. Differential Geometry and Forms. Since the tangent space to a differentiable manifold at each point is a vector space, we can apply to it the multilinear algebra presented in the previous section. Before doing this, we need to review some basic facts from differential geometry. <p> See Bryant et al. <ref> [3, pages 27-29] </ref>. For more general exterior differential systems we have the following integrability results. Theorem 33. If the Cauchy characteristic distribution A (I ) of I has constant dimension r in a neighborhood, then the distribution A (I ) is integrable. Proof. See Bryant et al. [3, page 31]. <p> For more general exterior differential systems we have the following integrability results. Theorem 33. If the Cauchy characteristic distribution A (I ) of I has constant dimension r in a neighborhood, then the distribution A (I ) is integrable. Proof. See Bryant et al. <ref> [3, page 31] </ref>. Theorem 34. Let I be a differential ideal whose retracting space C (I) has a constant dimension n r. <p> There is a neighborhood in which there are coordinates y 1 ; : : : ; y n such that I has a set of generators which are forms in y 1 ; : : : ; y nr . Proof. See Bryant et al. <ref> [3, pages 31-33] </ref>. 2.3.4. Derived flags. If the algebraic ideal generated by a Pfaffian system does not satisfy the Frobenius condition, then it is not a differential ideal. However, there may exist a differential ideal which is a subset of the algebraic ideal.

Reference-contexts: &gt; s 2 , that is, there is one tower which is strictly longer than the others, it can be shown that if there exists any which satisfies the congruences, then there also exists an integrable 0 which also satisfies the congruences (with a rescaling of the basis forms), see <ref> [4, 21] </ref>. However, if s 1 = s 2 , or there are at least two towers which are longest, this is no longer true. Thus, the assumption that is integrable is necessary for the general case.

Reference-contexts: As pointed out by Gardner and Shadwick in [11], this normal form is very close to the Goursat normal form for exterior differential systems. The problem of dynamic state feedback linearization, on the other hand, remained largely open, despite some early results by <ref> [6] </ref>. In his dissertation work Sluis [26] attempted to extend the exterior differential approach in this direction. This tutorial paper is divided into three parts. Section 2 contains the necessary mathematical background on algebra and geometry for defining exterior differential systems. <p> The feedback compensator is allowed to have its own dynamics, and we search for a transformation on the extended space, including the states of the original systems and the controller, into a linear form. 4.2.1. Problem Statement. Following the notation of Charlet, Levine, and Marino <ref> [6] </ref>, the problem of exact linearization by dynamic state feedback and coordinate transformation can be stated as follows: Problem 3. (Dynamic Feedback Linearization Problem) 8 Given a control system of the form (180), find, if possible, a dynamic feedback compensator: _w = a (x; w) + B (x; w)v where w <p> The problem of linearization by general dynamic state feedback and coordinate transformation is still mostly open. Even for the special case of dynamic extension no necessary and sufficient conditions exist. The following results are proven by Charlet, Levine, and Marino <ref> [6] </ref>: Theorem 60. If system (181) is locally dynamic feedback linearizable, then its Jacobian linearization at the origin is completely controllable. Proof. In [6]. Theorem 61. <p> Even for the special case of dynamic extension no necessary and sufficient conditions exist. The following results are proven by Charlet, Levine, and Marino <ref> [6] </ref>: Theorem 60. If system (181) is locally dynamic feedback linearizable, then its Jacobian linearization at the origin is completely controllable. Proof. In [6]. Theorem 61. <p> PAPPAS, J. LYGEROS, D. TILBURY, AND S. SASTRY then the system is locally dynamic feedback linearizable by dynamic extension and a local diffeomorphism on a neighborhood of the extended state space R n+ . Proof. In <ref> [6] </ref>. In [6], the necessary condition of Theorem 60 is shown not to be sufficient and the sufficient condition of Theorem 61 is shown to not be necessary by means of counterexamples. <p> PAPPAS, J.

The result follows from the above proposition. In fact Corollary 69 also holds for general dynamic feedback. Theorem 70. The following statements are equivalent: 1. System (181) with m = 1 is static feedback linearizable 2. System (181) with m = 1 is dynamic feedback linearizable Proof. See <ref> [6, 2] </ref>. In other words, dynamic state feedback is only helpful in the case of multi-input systems or Pfaffian systems with codimension greater than two. The proof for Theorem 70 can be found in [6] for the vector field formalism and in [2] for the infinitesimal Brunovsky form formalism. <p> System (181) with m = 1 is dynamic feedback linearizable Proof.

It should be noted here that the second proof is extremely simple whereas the vector field proof is rather complicated. <p> As noted by Charlet, Levine, and Marino <ref> [6] </ref>, this system does not satisfy the conditions of Theorem 61. We have seen that the system is linearizable after a dynamic extension of order 3 on u 2 . <p> This problem was first addressed in [14] and later, more formally, in [28]. A different approach, related more to input-output linearization is taken in [18] and <ref> [6] </ref>. It would be interesting to compare the two approaches, and hopefully determine classes of systems that are better suited for one or the other.

Reference-contexts: For nonlinear systems in particular, most of the research has concentrated on the analysis of the Lie algebras associated with controllability, reachability and observability. In recent years, however, a small but influential trend has begun in the literature on the use of other methods, such as differential algebra <ref> [9, 8, 10] </ref> and exterior differential systems [13, 11] for the analysis of nonlinear control systems and nonlinear implicit systems. In this paper we survey some key results from the theory of exterior differential systems and their application to current and challenging problems in robotics and control.

It can be shown (see <ref> [11] </ref>) that time need not enter into the transformation at all; that is, if the conditions of Theorem 46 are satisfied, a time-invariant state feedback and coordinate change can always be found. In addition the coordinate transformation can also be chosen to be independent of both time and input.

Reference-contexts: Some examples illustrate this conjecture. Example (Modified Ball and Beam). This example is inspired by the well known system of a ball rolling on a beam <ref> [14] </ref>; the small-angle approximation has been used to eliminate the sine term which appears in the dynamic equations, and all the constants have been normalized to unity. This is a single input system which is not linearizable by static (and hence dynamic) state feedback. <p> It is therefore useful to know what, if anything, can be done about systems which do not satisfy these conditions, as most systems encountered in practice fall into this category. This problem was first addressed in <ref> [14] </ref> and later, more formally, in [28]. A different approach, related more to input-output linearization is taken in [18] and [6]. It would be interesting to compare the two approaches, and hopefully determine classes of systems that are better suited for one or the other.

Reference-contexts: According to Theorem 47, the system is not linearizable by static state feedback. Example (VTOL <ref> [15] </ref>). This example is inspired by the dynamic equations for a planar vertical take-off and landing aircraft; parasitic effects have been eliminated to simplify the analysis. This is an example of a two input system that is not linearizable by static state feedback, but is linearizable by dynamic extension.

Reference-contexts: The first results in this direction were necessary and sufficient conditions for exact linearization of a nonlinear control system using static state feedback. The conditions were obtained using techniques from differential geometry (for a full discussion of this see <ref> [17, 23] </ref>). It was shown that a system that satisfies these conditions can be transformed into a special canonical form, the so called Brunovsky normal form. As pointed out by Gardner and Shadwick in [11], this normal form is very close to the Goursat normal form for exterior differential systems. <p> In the next section, we will consider the problem of dynamic feedback linearization. 4.1.1. Problem Statement. Following the notation of Isidori <ref> [17] </ref>, the problem of exact linearization by static state feedback and coordinate transformation can be stated as follows: Problem 1.

The standard results on linearization by static state feedback and coordinate transformation concern systems which are affine in the input (181). The relevant theorems can be found in <ref> [17, 23] </ref>; we will use the notation and definitions of Isidori [17]. Theorem 56. <p> The Vector Field Approach. The standard results on linearization by static state feedback and coordinate transformation concern systems which are affine in the input (181). The relevant theorems can be found in [17, 23]; we will use the notation and definitions of Isidori <ref> [17] </ref>. Theorem 56. <p> The distribution G n1 has dimension n 3. for each 0 i n 2 the distribution G i is involutive 74 G. PAPPAS, J. LYGEROS, D. TILBURY, AND S. SASTRY Proof. In <ref> [17, 23] </ref>. If the system has only one input (m = 1), the involutivity of G n2 will imply the involutivity of the other G i . Thus, the conditions for static feedback linearization can be restated in the single-input case as follows: Corollary 57.

Reference-contexts: It would be interesting to try to relate this observation with the maximal linearizable subsystem <ref> [19] </ref> and add more substance to this observation. To summarize, in this section we have approached the problem of feedback linearization of control systems using techniques such as vector fields, exterior differential systems, and the infinitesimal Brunovsky form. All give equivalent conditions for the static feedback linearization problem.

Reference-contexts: &gt; s 2 , that is, there is one tower which is strictly longer than the others, it can be shown that if there exists any which satisfies the congruences, then there also exists an integrable 0 which also satisfies the congruences (with a rescaling of the basis forms), see <ref> [4, 21] </ref>. However, if s 1 = s 2 , or there are at least two towers which are longest, this is no longer true. Thus, the assumption that is integrable is necessary for the general case.

Reference-contexts: The first results in this direction were necessary and sufficient conditions for exact linearization of a nonlinear control system using static state feedback. The conditions were obtained using techniques from differential geometry (for a full discussion of this see <ref> [17, 23] </ref>). It was shown that a system that satisfies these conditions can be transformed into a special canonical form, the so called Brunovsky normal form. As pointed out by Gardner and Shadwick in [11], this normal form is very close to the Goursat normal form for exterior differential systems. <p> The Vector Field Approach. The standard results on linearization by static state feedback and coordinate transformation concern systems which are affine in the input (181). The relevant theorems can be found in <ref> [17, 23] </ref>; we will use the notation and definitions of Isidori [17]. Theorem 56. <p> The distribution G n1 has dimension n 3. for each 0 i n 2 the distribution G i is involutive 74 G. PAPPAS, J. LYGEROS, D. TILBURY, AND S. SASTRY Proof. In <ref> [17, 23] </ref>. If the system has only one input (m = 1), the involutivity of G n2 will imply the involutivity of the other G i . Thus, the conditions for static feedback linearization can be restated in the single-input case as follows: Corollary 57.

Reference-contexts: Transformation 2. Coordinates of the origin seen from the last trailer. Yet another choice for f 1 corresponds to writing the coordinates of the origin as seen from the last trailer. This is reminiscent of a transformation used by Samson <ref> [24] </ref> in a different context, and is given by z 1 := f 1 (x) = x n cos n + y n sin n : (139) This has the physical interpretation of being the origin of the reference frame when viewed from a coordinate frame attached to the n th

Reference-contexts: Another version of the extended Goursat normal form Theorem is given here, which is easier to check, since it does not require finding a basis which satisfies the congruences but only one which is adapted to the derived flag. One special case of this theorem is proven in <ref> [25] </ref>. 56 G. PAPPAS, J. LYGEROS, D. TILBURY, AND S. SASTRY Theorem 47 (Extended Goursat Normal Form).

Reference-contexts: As pointed out by Gardner and Shadwick in [11], this normal form is very close to the Goursat normal form for exterior differential systems. The problem of dynamic state feedback linearization, on the other hand, remained largely open, despite some early results by [6]. In his dissertation work Sluis <ref> [26] </ref> attempted to extend the exterior differential approach in this direction. This tutorial paper is divided into three parts. Section 2 contains the necessary mathematical background on algebra and geometry for defining exterior differential systems.

Reference-contexts: Proof. The proof is easy to understand in the exterior differential systems framework. If k integrators are added to each input, then the k th derived system of the extended system is equal to the original system. For details see <ref> [27] </ref>. Therefore, dynamic extension is only useful for feedback linearization if a different number of integrators are added to each input channel, and there is at least one input channel to which no integrators are added. Corollary 69. <p> Only recently have upper bounds been determined on the number of dynamic extension steps required to feedback linearize a system <ref> [27] </ref>. No bound is known on the necessary dimension of a general dynamic state feedback. All of these are properties depend only on the system dynamics, it should therefore be possible to answer the above questions given only the system equations.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore useful to know what, if anything, can be done about systems which do not satisfy these conditions, as most systems encountered in practice fall into this category. This problem was first addressed in [14] and later, more formally, in <ref> [28] </ref>. A different approach, related more to input-output linearization is taken in [18] and [6]. It would be interesting to compare the two approaches, and hopefully determine classes of systems that are better suited for one or the other.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the prolonged system J can be put into Goursat normal form, paths can be found for the transformed system using one of the methods described in <ref> [36, 32] </ref>, and these paths can be projected down onto the original Pfaffian system I to give integral curves. <p> It should also be noted that most of the literature is concerned with dynamic extension and non-singular input transformations. Of the theorems presented here only Theorem 67 claims to address the general dynamic state feedback case. Singular input transformations are briefly discussed in <ref> [32] </ref> and compared with the corresponding results using the extended Goursat normal form and prolongations. Both of these topics merit further attention.

Reference-contexts: Our attention was first attracted to exterior differential systems through their applications in path planning for nonholonomic control systems. Our initial results were for the problem of steering a car with trailers <ref> [34] </ref>, [22], the so-called "parallel parking a car with N trailers problem." This involved the transformation of the system of nonholonomic rolling without slipping constraints on each pair of wheels into a canonical form, the so-called Goursat normal form. <p> There are no singularities of the second type for the unicycle (n = 0) or for the front-wheel drive car (n = 1). Once the constraints are in the Goursat normal form, paths can be found which connect any two desired configurations. See Tilbury, Murray, and Sastry <ref> [34] </ref> for details. 3.3. The Extended Goursat Normal Form. While the Goursat normal form is powerful, it is restricted to Pfaffian systems of codimension two. In order to study Pfaffian systems of higher codimension, we present the extended Goursat normal form.

Reference-contexts: In [36] we showed how the multi-steering N trailer system could be converted into a generalized Goursat normal form, which was easy to steer. The full analysis of the system from the exterior differential systems point of view was made in <ref> [35] </ref>. In parallel with this activity in nonholonomic motion planning there has been considerable activity in the nonlinear control community on the problem of exactly linearizing a nonlinear control system using (possibly dynamic) state feedback and change of coordinates.
