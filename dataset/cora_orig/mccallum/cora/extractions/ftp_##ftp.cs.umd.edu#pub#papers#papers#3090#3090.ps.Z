Reference-contexts: The readers need for supporting tools has been recognized by some software designers. Scrolling, string searching and sorting tools are common place in word processing and database applications. Hypertexts have prompted the development of tools that assist browsing, exploration, and discovery <ref> (e.g. Allinson & Hammond, 1989) </ref>. This paper seeks to show that such tools are likely to be needed in all electronic documents and that the potential of a vast range of other tools remains to be exploited.

Reference-contexts: Consider people who intend making a day trip to a large city and who have access to a hypermedia database about the city. A visitor to Glasgow, Scotland, for example, may access the hypermedia database Glasgow Online <ref> (Baird & Percival, 1989) </ref>. Such visitors may have agendas that include key places they want to visit (e.g. a museum, an art gallery, a park) and things that they want to do which may not be totally place specific (e.g. see a play, buy a book).

Reference-contexts: The most familiar pointer tool is perhaps the bookmark. This differs from the pointer tools considered so far in that it requires deliberate placement by the reader, rather than being an automatic output of the search activity. Bookmarks have been included in some hypertext systems <ref> (e.g., Benest, 1990) </ref> as well as in a range of word processing applications (from Wordstar to Nisus). In terms of their display characteristics, electronic bookmarks can differ in many ways.

Reference-contexts: In particular, planning tools can act as intelligent assistants which help readers transform their goals of finding, comparing and deciding into the activities of searching, collecting and applying criteria (cf. Carlson and Ram, 1990). Although there already exist demonstrations of intelligent support for navigation within hypertexts <ref> (Boyle and Snell, 1990) </ref>, the major advantage of an intelligent planning assistant is that it can suggest how to do the task as well as provide tools for actually carrying out the plans once made. These two aspects of planning are depicted in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: However, computer-based tools can enhance readers planning behaviour in much more powerful ways. In particular, planning tools can act as intelligent assistants which help readers transform their goals of finding, comparing and deciding into the activities of searching, collecting and applying criteria <ref> (cf. Carlson and Ram, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Moreover designers are inventing new typographic cues with new meanings such as boxes, pointers, and animated words. Embedded links may only become apparent when requested by readers (e.g. GUIDE). Readers might wish to create their own personal routes through the text, routes which they could re-navigate whenever they wanted <ref> (Chin, 1989) </ref>. This might be done on either a temporary (e.g. task specific) or a permanent basis. Such functionality requires new tools and perhaps also new skills being made available to readers. There are important issues about the integration of navigation control with the display (s) of the text content.

Reference-contexts: Such tools take advantage of the processability of electronic text. Electronic documents are not all alike. They include linear texts generated by word processors, databases generated by file management applications, hypertexts generated by architectures that facilitate the creation of links among items of information <ref> (cf. Conklin, 1987) </ref>, and hypermedia where sound and animated graphic displays supplement the written information (cf. Ambron & Hooper, 1988; Laurel et al., 1990).

Reference-contexts: courses of action (e.g., to visit X or to visit Y), possible states of the world (e.g., X may be closed or Y is nearby), and an associated set of probabilities and payoffs are analyzed and searched for the optimal choice on the basis of Bayesian and expected utility theory <ref> (Edwards, 1961) </ref>. In multiattribute decision making, a set of available alternatives is listed with their associated attributes and the utility of having those attributes.

Reference-contexts: The extent to which the use of such novel and powerful tools may have important consequences for human problemsolving and decision making cannot even be conjectured at this stage <ref> (cf. Engelbart et al, 1973) </ref>. Planning tools can assist not only with structuring the task and with finding relevant information, but also with the collection and manipulation of that information.

Reference-contexts: Without such help it is easy for searchers to either define the search target so narrowly that many relevant items are missed, or define the target so broadly that the information being sought is swamped by a mountain of irrelevant material <ref> (cf. Lesk, 1989) </ref>. The kinds of search tools required will depend on the specificity of the target. At one end of the specificity continuum, it may be possible to use a string search to find the few instances of an easily specifiable target (e.g. the whereabouts of Picasso exhibits).

Reference-contexts: A number of sophisticated computer-based tools for decision making and problem solving exist <ref> (e.g. MacLean and Sol, 1986) </ref> and their relevance to serious reading will be considered below. But the kinds of data manipulation that could be useful to readers include many simpler tools. Readers may want to sort the collected information in various ways.

Reference-contexts: McAleese, 1989; McAleese and Green, 1990; Shneiderman & Kearsley, 1989). It is also a domain where there exists research evidence relating to some of the constituent activities of serious reading tasks <ref> (e.g. Marchionini, 1988) </ref>. A concrete example of the kinds of serious reading task being addressed here will help to make salient the categories of tools that could be useful to readers.

Reference-contexts: NoteCards has the potential for graphically showing the semantic relationships among the items found, or at least the relationships of these items to some view of the text structure <ref> (Marshall and Irish, 1989) </ref>. This may well have advantages over the more conventional table of contents, but even for fairly small documents it is not obvious that untutored readers will have the ability to make good use of this richer display.

Reference-contexts: This theme is consonant with other suggestions that the slow spread of information in hypertext form has been partly due to the failure to integrate hypertexts with the other computer-based applications that readers may be working with to achieve their superordinate task goals <ref> (Meyrowitz,1989) </ref>. Hypertext documents provide readers with access to relevant information but they do not help readers collect and manipulate that information easily, nor do they facilitate its integration with other software.

Reference-contexts: Readers could be told how many targets would be found if pizza were changed to include other fast food places or if the location were moved. Without such help many searchers would have to start again in an almost blind fashion if the first search failed <ref> (Norman and Butler, 1989) </ref>. Target specificity is not the only factor which contributes to peoples difficulties in finding material relevant to their reading objectives. Readers may know how to formulate their query but lack the mental capacity to apply that knowledge, perhaps because of other concurrent task demands.

Reference-contexts: Helping people structure their tasks and refine their goals so that they make best use of the information resource can be much harder, although inroads are being made into such problems <ref> (e.g. Pavlin, 1990) </ref>. The need for guidance in doing the task is apparent when considering visitors to town who first decide where to have lunch and then discover that they are too far from the museum to get there before it closes.

In Proceedings of Hypertext '87. </title> <institution> University of North Carolina, </institution> <address> Raleigh, NC. </address>
Reference-contexts: In contrast, third party vendors could provide software for generating indexes and might supply some of the nonembedded navigation aids. SuperBook offers one example of just such a division of labor between author and the provider of additional navigation assistance <ref> (Remde et al. 1987) </ref>. Tools from third parties are particularly valuable as a resource for dealing with materials which have already been written, or which are being written primarily for printed distribution but are available electronically. <p> Existing hypertext systems have instantiated pointer tools in many different ways. For example, SuperBook integrates the results of any search with the display of the table of contents. This shows how the targets frequency of occurrence varies throughout the document <ref> (Remde, et al., 1987) </ref>. In contrast, HyperCard displays the results of a search in a single window, where the location of only one retrieved item can be seen at a time.

Reference-contexts: The advent of electronic documents makes this aspect of readers behaviour more salient, and urges its incorporation within theories of reading. Certainly in some serious reading tasks it has been found desirable to provide a diversity of navigation options in order to meet readers requirements <ref> (e.g. Salomon, 1990) </ref>. The embedded links within a hypertext can be instantiated in many ways and can have very different display characteristics. Sometimes typographic cues, such as bold and italic type, are stripped of their conventional meanings and reassigned to navigation functions.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in expert problem solving, such as fault diagnosis and anomaly resolution, information collected may be a set of possible states, actions, and goals <ref> (Schank and Riesbeck, 1981) </ref>. The expert system would act on this information to search for a possible solution and/or to request additional information. Because expert systems require domain specific knowledge, they will be developed for subgroups of serious readers rather than being widely available.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes typographic cues, such as bold and italic type, are stripped of their conventional meanings and reassigned to navigation functions.

On the other hand, designers could take advantage of the conventional meanings of typographic cues by associating their connotation with the type of link provided. For example, parenthetic citations could be used to go to that reference.

Reference-contexts: Work by Black (1990) suggests that this record of prior problem solving activity can be very important in supporting the creative performance of typography students creating a page layout. Tools have been built that address this problem, tools such as the Designers Notepad <ref> (Sommerville, et al, 1990) </ref> which allow users to designate any partial solution as a node from which they can then branch out in one or more directions. The benefits of such manipulation tools are likely to extend beyond information which can be thought of as design history.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that most of the reading done in the context of work is some form of "reading to do" <ref> (Sticht, 1985) </ref>.

In time, conventions for navigating in electronic documents may become established.
