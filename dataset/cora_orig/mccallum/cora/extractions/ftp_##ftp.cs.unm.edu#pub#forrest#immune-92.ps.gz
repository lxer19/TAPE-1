Abstract: This paper describes an immune system model based on binary strings. The purpose of the model is to study the pattern recognition processes and learning that take place at both the individual and species levels in the immune system. The genetic algorithm (GA) is a central component of the model. The paper reports simulation experiments on two pattern recognition problems that are relevant to natural immune systems. Finally, it reviews the relation between the model and explicit fitness sharing techniques for genetic algorithms, showing that the immune system model implements a form of implicit fitness sharing.

Reference-contexts: An elaborate genetic mechanism involving the combinatorial association of a number 2 of gene segments underlies the construction of these receptors, so that an animal has the genetic capability of expressing over 10 10 different receptors on B cells <ref> (Berek & Milstein, 1988) </ref> and over 10 16 different receptors on T cells (Davis & Bjorkman, 1988). In mice and humans, it is thought that the resident population of lymphocytes expresses a repertoire of about 10 7 different receptors at any time.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the individual cells and molecules (lymphocytes, antibodies, etc.) that comprise the immune system encode and operate the control mechanism in parallel. The enormous diversity of the molecules employed by the immune system is the key to its pattern recognition capabilities. The underlying principle is called clonal selection <ref> (Burnet, 1959) </ref>. Clonal selection is related to Darwin's theory of natural selection but applied to the cell populations within the immune system. Recognition in the immune system is performed by B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. Each lymphocyte expresses receptor molecules of one particular shape on its surface.

Reference-contexts: However, there is an important distinction to be drawn between fitness sharing and the implicit sharing in the immune system simulations. In fitness sharing, oe s is a strict cutoff based on d ij , which Deb <ref> (Deb, 1989) </ref> recommends setting based on the volume of a hypersphere around a given peak. In the immune system algorithm, oe dictates a cutoff based on the proportion of the population within a hypersphere around a given antigen.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we summarize the analysis described in (Smith et al., in press) which shows the relation between our algorithm and earlier fitness sharing algorithms developed for GAs. 2 Binary Immune System Model Our immune system model is based on a universe first introduced by Farmer et al. <ref> (Farmer et al., 1986) </ref> in which both antigens and antibodies are represented by binary strings. This is a simplification from the real biology in which genes are specified by a four-letter nucleic acid alphabet and recognition between antibodies and antigens is based on their three-dimensional shapes and physical properties.

Maenner (Eds.), </editor> <title> Parallel Problem Solving from Nature, </title> <publisher> Berlin. Springer-Verlag (Lecture Notes in Computer Science). </publisher>
Reference-contexts: Using this basic idea, many different specific functions can be defined that are linear or nonlinear in l i . We have studied several different match functions, including simple linear, exponential, and threshold functions <ref> (Forrest & Perelson, 1991) </ref>. Here we shall use the simplest of these functions: M 0 = i M 0 simply counts the total number of bits that differ between antigen and antibody. Using the bit string representation for antibodies, we construct random populations of antigens and antibodies.

Reference-contexts: These patterns are analogous to the schemas described in the GA literature <ref> (Goldberg, 1989) </ref>. Experiments were conducted using the GA described for the multiple-peaks problem described above. For these experiments we used a population of 100 antibodies (initialized randomly), ran the GA for 500 generations, used crossover and mutation rates of 0.5 and 0.001, respectively, and varied oe between experiments.

Reference-contexts: tend not 11 to do well in this problem because the antigen that a specialist antibody recognizes is unlikely to be presented to that same antibody in subsequent generations (unless ae is very high). 3.1 How well can the GA detect common schemas? Using the Genesis public domain software package <ref> (Grefenstette, 1984) </ref>, modified to accommodate our fitness function (see Section 4), we studied how the GA solves the schema detection problem, in which antigens contain predefined schemas.

Reference-contexts: The model presented here makes the important simplification that a bit string represents both the genes that code for an antibody and the phenotypic expression of the molecule. For example, mutation operates on the bit string and causes antibodies to mutate. In another model we explicitly consider V-region genes <ref> (Hightower et al., 1993) </ref> , the construction of antibody molecules by joining a set of small gene segments, and recombination of genes between individuals in a population. Here, antibodies are created directly rather than by genetic operations on a set of gene segments.

Reference-contexts: The learning task is thus to evolve a set of antibodies that meets the coverage requirement. In (Smith et al., in press) we pointed out the need for generalization in populations of coadapted individuals (e.g., for set cover problems, recognition problems, and almost any learning classifier system <ref> (Holland et al., 1986) </ref>), and we discussed why generalization is not always required for GA applications. The generalization issue arises when there are not enough individuals in the population to assign one individual (or subpopulation) to each task, niche, or fitness peak.

Reference-contexts: To perform these tasks the immune system must be capable of distinguishing self cells and molecules, which it should not destroy, from foreign cells and molecules (antigens), which it should destroy. The enormity of this task has not been fully quantified, but Inman <ref> (Inman, 1978) </ref> has calculated that the immune system appears to be able to recognize at least 10 16 foreign molecules.

Reference-contexts: The degree of match is quantified by a matching function M : Antigen fi Antibody ! &lt;. Figure 1 illustrates the matching procedure. There are many possible match rules that are plausible physiologically <ref> (Perelson, 1989) </ref>. For example, M can simply count the number of complementary bits or M can identify contiguous regions of complementary bitwise matches within the string.

Reference-contexts: For clonal selection to work efficiently the receptors on lymphocytes need to be diverse enough to recognize essentially any antigen. Immunologists call a repertoire complete if there exists at least one receptor that can recognize any antigen. Using a probablistic model Perelson and Oster <ref> (Perelson & Oster, 1979) </ref> define precise conditions for repertoire completeness and show that if the 10 7 receptors in the repertoire are made at random then one would expect the repertoire to be complete. However, receptors are not made entirely randomly. <p> The number of these antibodies is not known precisely and seems to vary from one antigen to the next. Typically tens or hundreds of different antibodies are found that match an antigen with sufficient strength to be important in an immune response. From the work of Perelson and Oster <ref> (Perelson & Oster, 1979) </ref> one can estimate that if antibodies are made at random, then about 10 5 antibodies would be required to cover the space of antigens.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 illustrates the matching procedure. There are many possible match rules that are plausible physiologically (Perelson, 1989). For example, M can simply count the number of complementary bits or M can identify contiguous regions of complementary bitwise matches within the string. Stadnyk <ref> (Stadnyk, 1987) </ref> introduced a function M that computes the lengths l i of the complementary regions, and combines them such that long regions are rewarded more than short ones. Using this basic idea, many different specific functions can be defined that are linear or nonlinear in l i .
