Title: NetCrypt: A Transparent Secure Communication Service  
Author: Andrew Adams, Patrick D. McDaniel, David Stephenson 
Date: April 17, 1997  
Abstract: In this paper we describe the architecture and performance characteristics of a transparent, secure communication service developed for the Linux operating system. We address two key issues: performance and distributed key management. In distributed systems, conventional cryptography provides good performance at the cost of unacceptable key distribution overhead, while public key cryptography provides scalable key distribution but suffers from poor performance. We present a hybrid solution which uses public key cryptography for key management and conventional cryptography for fast block encryption. Detailed discussions of the system design, operation, and protocols are given. Finally, we present the results of our performance testing, and analyze to what extent we attained our stated goals.

Reference-contexts: Not only do these environments complicate network administration, but a high development cost is incurred when applications are retooled to take advantage of these security services. The Ker-beros infrastructure <ref> [1, 2] </ref> is an example of such a phenomenon. The reason for the lack of operating system level support for secure communication is twofold. <p> A hybrid of conventional and public key cryptography are used achieve integrity and secrecy. There are many similar protocols in the literature that achieve these goals <ref> [3, 4, 1, 2, 5] </ref>. These protocols are session based and provide mutual authentication. The traffic serviced by the NetCrypt system may not be session based (as in the case of UDP traffic).

Firstly, the cryptographic algorithms used by NetCrypt should be strong enough such that no known attacks against them are computationally feasible by any but the most well equipped attackers. <p> Conventional cryptosystems have the advantage of being significantly faster than public key cryptosys-tems, especially when implemented in hardware. Implemented in software, DES runs about 100 times faster than RSA. In hardware, DES runs about 1000 times as fast <ref> [4] </ref>. Unfortunately, the cost of key management for conventional cryptosystems scales badly as the network size increases. A network with ff hosts requires the generation and distribution of O (ff 2 ) shared keys. <p> Con--sequently, no decrypted message keys are ever visible outside the kernel. The mechanics of chosen ciphertext attacks are fully described in <ref> [4] </ref>. 5.1.3 RSA Key Generation Attacks Most known attacks against the RSA algorithm take advantage of poorly chosen numeric elements during key generation. Detailed descriptions of these attacks and heuristics for avoiding them are given in [4]. <p> The mechanics of chosen ciphertext attacks are fully described in <ref> [4] </ref>. 5.1.3 RSA Key Generation Attacks Most known attacks against the RSA algorithm take advantage of poorly chosen numeric elements during key generation. Detailed descriptions of these attacks and heuristics for avoiding them are given in [4]. The NetCrypt system relies upon the RSAREF library to generate public/private key pairs and to avoid keys susceptible to attack. 5.1.4 DES Attacks The DES cipher is the single most widely used cryptographic algorithm. <p> Any attacker able to determine the set of random numbers used by the NetCrypt system will be able to foil all provided security. Obtaining true randomness is a non-trivial problem, and random number generation is an area of much past and present research <ref> [9, 10, 4] </ref>. For example, the PGP program (see section ??) measures time intervals between keystrokes to seed its random number generator. <p> PEM gains flexibility by allowing the user more choices of cryptographic algorithms. 7.2 Pretty Good Privacy Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a freeware program for encrypting and authenticating electronic mail <ref> [4] </ref>. 10 Like NetCrypt, PGP uses a hybrid cryptosystem in-corporating a conventional block cipher, IDEA, to encrypt messages, RSA public/private keys to encrypt the message key, and MD5 as a one-way hash function for signatures. PGP also provides facilities for generating and managing RSA public/private key pairs. <p> PGP's weakest aspect is key revocation, as there is no means to inform all users when a key is compromised. PGP uses IDEA, instead of a DES variant, for encrypting the message text. IDEA is faster than DES and believed to be more secure. <ref> [4] </ref> Like PEM, PGP runs as a user process and must be explicitly invoked. 7.3 IP/Secure IP/Secure is a modification to the Internet Protocol to provide for encryption and authentication. It also includes Internet Security Control Protocol (ISCP), a key management and distribution system based upon RSA public/private key pairs.

Reference-contexts: Attacks that were considered computationally infeasible in 1975 are possible with relatively inexpensive hardware today. Thus the 64-bit (with 56 bits of keying material) keys of the original proposal can be broken within a matter of weeks using readily available hardware. Other attacks, such as differential cryptanalysis <ref> [8] </ref> perform better than brute force attacks, and can be used to decrease the time to break a key. The strength of DES against attacks can be greatly increased using computationally inexpensive methods.
