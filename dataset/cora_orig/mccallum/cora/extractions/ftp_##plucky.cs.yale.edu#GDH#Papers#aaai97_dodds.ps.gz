Abstract: Landmark-based approaches to robot navigation require an "interest operator" to estimate the utility of a particular image region as an effective representative for a scene. This paper presents a color interest operator consisting of a weighted combination of heuristic scores. The operator selects those image regions (landmarks) likely to be found again, even under a different viewing geometry and/or different illumination conditions. These salient regions yield a robust representation for recognition of a scene. Experiments showing the reproduceability of the regions selected by this operator demonstrate its use as a hedge against environmental uncertainties.

Reference-contexts: In the latter case, the results of the algorithm are dependent on which tile is chosen to seed to next potential landmark. While we have found experimentally that different choice strategies do not greatly affect perfor mance, other algorithms <ref> (Baumgartner & Skaar 1996) </ref> do eliminate this dependence on the seed choices. Reproduceability of Landmarks The color-histogram representation itself serves the goal of finding image landmarks under changing viewpoint geometry. Fundamentally, a histogram measures the area covered by each of the colors in a feature.

Landmark-finding Algorithm Our algorithm for finding landmarks uses a standard region-growing technique <ref> (Beveridge et al. 1989) </ref> where the similarity measure among subsets of an image is the inner product of their color histograms: * Divide the image into tiles of a small, fixed size. * Compute the color histograms of these image tiles. * Starting with a seed tile as the current feature,

Reference-contexts: The halogen light was considered the canonical composition; match scores were then taken with the other four lights. Note that a color constancy algorithm was not used in this experiment; pre-processing the image to appear as if illuminated by a standard illuminant, <ref> (Forsyth 1990) </ref>, would further improve the results. The three regions considered were (1) the reddish mountains, (2) a blue portion of the poster beside them, (3) a low-saturation, off-white patch (one of the image regions deemed least suitable for use as a landmark).

Reference-contexts: As modeled in <ref> (Funt 1995) </ref>, a change in ambient lighting intensity corresponds to a linear variation in pixel values along all three axes of RGB space. In the Hue-Saturation-Intensity color space, however, such a change corresponds only to a variation of the vertical intensity axis. <p> Hanging next to a red exit sign, however, its range and its reproduceability based on color information alone are much smaller. The edges between color patches have been used to make Swain and Ballard's color-histogram indexing technique more robust to differing illuminant intensities. <ref> (Funt 1995) </ref> We adapt this idea by considering the relationship between a landmark and its boundary, or frame. By definition, a landmark's frame must differ in its color composition from the its body.

Reference-contexts: Its often-cited shortcoming are its sin-gularities at the vertex, where hue and saturation are undefined, and along the intensity axis, where hue is undefined. <ref> (Liu & Yang 1994) </ref> Dividing up HSI space into bins along lines of hue and saturation would necessarily group all of the greyscale pixels into a single bin. Such a scheme runs counter to our intuitive segmentation of a scene.

Reference-contexts: The Stan-ford Cart had one of the first artificial vision systems which looked for regions of interest from the scenes it recorded. <ref> (Moravec 1983) </ref> The Cart's "Interest Operator" sought corners and areas of high contrast in order to localize and avoid obstacles between it and its goal. We propose in this paper a "Color Interest Operator," also suited for robotic localization and navigation tasks.

Reference-contexts: The dominant color, a mean color value, or another statistically-based measure might be used to characterize a portion of an image. We follow Swain and Ballard's work in color histogramming, originally proposed to enable fast indexing into an image database. <ref> (Swain & Ballard 1991) </ref> We represent a landmark as two histograms: one which stores the colors of the feature itself and another which stores the colors immediately around the first: f and b from equation 2.
