Abstract: Due to the scaling down of device geometry and increasing frequency in deep sub-micron designs, crosstalk between interconnection wires has become an important issue in VLSI layout design. In this paper, we consider crosstalk avoidance during global routing. We present a global routing algorithm based on a new Steiner tree formulation and the Lagrangian relaxation technique. We also give theoretical results on the complexity of the problem.

Reference-contexts: We can model all parameters except coupling capacitance by a crosstalk coefficient. For each net i, the crosstalk coefficient from net j is a real number e ij 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> which is the crosstalk on net i contributed by one unit of coupling capacitance from net j. <p> The general theory for sub-gradient method states that if k ! 0 and j=1 j ! 1 as k ! 1, it will converge to an optimal solution <ref> [1] </ref>. But we must notice that an optimal solution to the LMP does not always give an optimal solution to the re-routing for crosstalk control problem.

Reference-contexts: All these factors increase the coupling effect (inductive and capacitive) between interconnection wires. Increased coupling effect not only increases signal delays, but also decreases signal integrity due to transmission line behavior. This phenomenon is called crosstalk <ref> [2] </ref>. Most previous works on crosstalk avoidance are focused on detailed routing [3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 14], where the estimation of crosstalk is accurate but the flexibility to avoid it is restricted.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we assume coupling capacitance only exists between neighboring parallel wires and is given by the following formula: C = ff length distance fi ; (2) where fi is a constant which was estimated to be about 2 in <ref> [10] </ref>. 3 Problem formulation In traditional design flow, routing is divided into global and detailed routing. In global routing, the set of regions a net goes through is decided. In detailed routing, the actual route in each region is then computed.

Reference-contexts: Five circuits from the CBL/NCSU building block benchmarks: ami33, ami49, apte, hp, and xe- rox are used. Since these benchmarks do not come with placement information, we use a floorplaner based on simulated annealing <ref> [12] </ref> to give placements. Using different parameters, we obtain two different placements for both ami33 and ami49: ami33.1, ami33.2, ami49.1, ami49.2, and three different placements for xerox: xerox.1, xerox.2, xerox.3.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is often not possible to find a crosstalk-feasible solution in detailed routing if the global routing is crosstalk- blinded. In order to make a global routing solution crosstalk risk- free, Xue et al. <ref> [13] </ref> proposed a post global routing adjustment procedure to modify a given routing solution. It used a gridded model and assumed that the crosstalk only exists between adjacent wires. That is, if there is a spare track between two wires, then there is no crosstalk between them. <p> If a region still requires extra tracks after bound partitioning and net ordering, some nets in the region are ripped up and re-routed using other regions. In this paper, we consider crosstalk avoidance during global routing. We use a crosstalk model which is more general than that of <ref> [13] </ref>. In order to have an accurate crosstalk estimation, we extend global routing to include layer and track fl This work was partially supported by the Texas Advanced Research Program under Grant No. 003658288. assignments. Based on this extension, a novel Crosstalk- Constrained Global Routing problem is defined.
