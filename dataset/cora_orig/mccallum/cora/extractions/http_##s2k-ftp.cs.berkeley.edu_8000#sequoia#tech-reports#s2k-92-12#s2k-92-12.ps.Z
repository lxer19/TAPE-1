Title: THE SEQUOIA 2000 STORAGE BENCHMARK  
Author: Michael Stonebraker, James Frew, Kenn Gardels and Jeff Meredith 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: EECS Dept. University of California,  
Abstract: This paper presents a benchmark that concisely captures the data base requirements of a collection of Earth Scientists working in the SEQUOIA 2000 project on various aspects of global change research. This benchmark has the novel characteristic that it uses real data sets and real queries that are representative of Earth Science tasks. Because it appears that Earth Science problems are typical of the problems of engineering and scientific DBMS users, we claim that this benchmark represents the needs of this more general community. Also included in the paper are benchmark results for four example DBMSs, ARC-INFO, GRASS, IPW and POSTGRES.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION There have been numerous benchmarks oriented toward DBMS performance in a variety of application areas. Perhaps the most famous one, TP1 <ref> [ANON85] </ref> is oriented toward business data processing, and has spawned a collection of derivative benchmarks, the most recent being TPC-A, TPC-B and TPC-C. These benchmarks represent the typical needs of a transaction processing user of a DBMS.

Reference-contexts: Such users typically store large data arrays, and their needs appear to be similar to the simulation users described above. In <ref> [BELL88] </ref> one can find additional information on the concerns of this class of users. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present the data base that we use in the benchmark. Section 3 presents the operations that must be performed.

Reference-contexts: We have purposely designed the benchmark for durability in the face of technological change. Many other benchmarks, become quickly obsolete because of increasing storage capacities at all levels of a storage system. For example, the Wisconsin benchmark <ref> [BITT83] </ref>, originally designed as a disk benchmark, now fits easily into most common main memory caches, thereby dramatically reducing its utility. 3. THE BENCHMARK QUERIES In this section we present the 11 queries that form the benchmark.

Reference-contexts: These benchmarks represent the typical needs of a transaction processing user of a DBMS. They consist of short update-oriented transactions that will stress the transaction system and the basic overhead of simple command processing. Another benchmark <ref> [CATT92] </ref> is oriented toward electronic computer aided design (ECAD) applications.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the technique used to perform the recursion is much less important than the utilization of input pruning. Optimizing this query will require different capabilities than available in current systems with recursive processing, such as LDL <ref> [CHIM91] </ref> and NAIL [ULLM85]. 4. BENCHMARK CONSTRAINTS AND REPORTING CONVENTIONS There are several points that we wish to make in this section. First, it is permissible to run the benchmark on any combination of hardware and software that the user desires.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of our benchmark is twofold. First, SEQUOIA 2000 Computer Scientists need a standard baseline case on which to judge new technical ideas. Second, publication of this benchmark should heighten awareness in the DBMS community of ES needs. Although DBMS research has yielded spatial access methods e.g. <ref> [ROBI81, NIEV84, GUTM84, FALO87, SAME84, LOME90] </ref> and spatial query languages e.g [ROUS85], little of this work has found its way into real general purpose systems. We hope that this benchmark will cause system builders to focus more energy in the direction of ES users.

Reference-contexts: An extensive collection of other DBMS-oriented benchmarks is contained in <ref> [GRAY91] </ref>. We feel that there is a broad application area, namely engineering and scientific data bases, that has special needs not addressed by any of the above benchmarks. This community is typified by Earth Scientists, whose DBMS needs we are trying to support in the SEQUOIA 2000 research project [STON92].

We hope that this benchmark will cause system builders to focus more energy in the direction of ES users. <p> For the medium benchmark, Query 1 can be broken into a collection of partial loads, if it is more convenient that way. For POSTGRES we implemented the schema discussed earlier and used the standard copy utility included in the system. We chose to build R-tree <ref> [GUTM84] </ref> indexes on location in the POINT and POLYGON classes and on segment in the GRAPH class. We also require B-tree indexes on time and band for RASTER, name for POINT, and name for POLYGON.

Reference-contexts: THE BENCHMARK QUERIES In this section we present the 11 queries that form the benchmark. In each case, we write the query in words and also express it in POSTQUEL <ref> [MOSH92] </ref>. <p> in the POINT class INT-1: an integer, set for this benchmark at 64 FLOAT-1: a floating point number, set for this benchmark at 1.0 FLOAT-2: a floating point number, set for this benchmark at 10.0 For each task we show the code that is required in the query language, POSTQUEL <ref> [MOSH92] </ref> for the schema discussed earlier. This is done to assist the reader in understanding the semantics of the operation. 3.1. Data Load Query 1: Create and load the data base and build any necessary secondary indexes. Earth Scientists expend much effort loading new data into their computer systems.

Reference-contexts: Since none offer a spatial access method or support for arrays, we would have to simulate these features. To use B-trees for spatial indexing, we would have to transform two-dimensional spatial data into a one-dimensional structure suitable for B-tree indexing. Z transforms <ref> [OREN86] </ref> are one of several techniques that could accomplish this task. However, Queries 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 deal with spatial areas and not points. To solve any of these queries one must investigate multiple intervals in the one-dimensional space, thereby slowing performance.
