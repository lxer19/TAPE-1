Title: Stability in ATM Networks  
Author: Chengzhi Li Amitava Raha and Wei Zhao 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the issues of stability in ATM networks. A network is stable if and only if all the packets have a bounded delay. We first consider ATM networks with FCFS scheduling policy. We then study networks with priority driven scheduling policy. For each network, we develop criteria for testing the stability of an ATM network and methods of deriving delay bounds in a stable network. In previous work, the Cruz-Gallager-Parekh ring has been a "benchmark" architecture to study the stability problem. For example, Gallager and Parekh claimed that the ring with size no more than four switches is stable when the total utilization of the links is less than 100% [10]. We validated this result. Furthermore, we find that a ring with large number of switches is stable if the total utilization of the links is less than or equal to 73%.

Reference-contexts: In [10], system stability was ensured by considering a specialized weight assignment for the PGPS scheduling policy in order to restore the connections traffic at the output of a sever. The other approaches deal with the problem using information on network topology or application semantics. For example, <ref> [1, 10] </ref> considered ATM networks with the specialized ring topology. In [12], a CAC algorithm for real-time applications was developed. The CAC algorithm addresses the traffic dependence issue and determines if all the deadlines of real-time messages can be met. <p> Therefore, the input ports, the switching fabric, the output ports, and the physical links can be modeled as servers serving ATM connections. The servers are classified into two categories: constant servers and variable servers <ref> [1, 12, 13] </ref>. A constant server is the one that offers a constant delay to each cell that uses it and does not by itself change the traffic flow characteristics of a connection. For example, physical links and the switching fabric are constant delay line servers. <p> We assume that a link into server j is uniquely identified by an integer in the range <ref> [1; L j ] </ref>. * F k;j (I) is the maximum number of cells that can arrive at server j over its k th input link in any interval of length I. * m i;j;k denotes the membership of connection M i in the k th link into server j. <p> F i;j (I) specifies the maximum number of cells that can arrive at server j in any interval of length I. We further assume that the cell traffic at the input of connection M i is characterized by the piecewise linear model with parameters fi i ; and i <ref> [1] </ref>. Hence, for any connection M i , we have F i;s (i;1) (I) = min (I; fi i + i fl I): (6) The cell traffic of many applications can be characterized by the linear model. <p> Hence, the iterative procedure converges. 4.2 Cruz-Gallager-Parekh Ring In this subsection, we study ATM networks with a specialized ring topology. This topology has been used as an representative benchmark by Cruz, Gal-lager, and Parekh to study the problem of stability in ATM networks <ref> [1, 10] </ref>. Henceforth, we shall refer to this topology as the Cruz-Gallager-Parekh (C-G-P) ring. The architecture of the C-G-P ring is described as follows. <p> We have focused on the development of criteria for testing the stability of an ATM network and the determination of the delay bounds in a stable network. The problem of stability in ATM networks was studied by many researchers <ref> [1, 10, 12] </ref> However, our work differs from the previous work by making the following contributions: We introduced two important results to analyze ATM networks.

Reference-contexts: There have been several approaches to solve the problem. The first approach considers ATM networks with specialized mechanism's (both hardware and software) so as to prevent cyclic interdependencies between connections. Much of the previous studies using this approach have concentrated on designing specialized scheduling policies for ATM switches <ref> [5, 10, 15] </ref>. In [5, 15], non-work conserving systems were studied where traffic regulation and restoration are used to ensure the network stability. <p> The first approach considers ATM networks with specialized mechanism's (both hardware and software) so as to prevent cyclic interdependencies between connections.

Reference-contexts: Network stability has been a research problem studied by many researchers. For example, it was established that for satellite packet switching using the ALOHA protocol if the network throughput is pushed much above 36% then the network can be potentially unstable <ref> [7] </ref>. We choose ATM to address the issue of stability. ATM networks are expected to provide guaranteed quality of services (QoS). With the proliferation of multimedia applications, bounded delay has become an important quality of service requirement.

The results of Corollary 1 means that any ATM network with the C-G-P ring topology is stable if the maximum link utilization in the network is less than 73:2%. <p> An interested reader is referred to <ref> [8] </ref>. Theorem 6 establishes the criteria for stability and gives the expression for the worst case delay experienced by a connection in an ATM network with SFGDP servers. <p> We also extend our results to ATM networks with servers employing work conserving scheduling policies other than FCFS and SFGDP. The proofs are not given in this paper due to space limitation. An interested reader is referred to <ref> [8] </ref>. 6.1 General Source Traffic Recall that in Theorems 3, 5, and 6 we assumed that the source traffic of the connections were constrained by the piecewise linear traffic description function.
