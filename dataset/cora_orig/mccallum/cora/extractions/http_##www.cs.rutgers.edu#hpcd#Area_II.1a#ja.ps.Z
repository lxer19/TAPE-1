Abstract: An automated design methodology incorporating industry-standard Navier-Stokes codes and a gradient-based optimizer has been developed. This system is used to redesign the well-known NASA P2 and P8 hypersonic inlets. First, the Navier-Stokes simulations of the original P2 and P8 inlet designs are validated using numerical convergence studies and comparison with wind-tunnel experimental data for the original inlets published by NASA in the early 1970s. Second, the P2 and P8 inlets are redesigned with the objective of canceling the cowl shock (and, in the case of the P8 inlet, the additional cowl-generated compression) at the centerbody by appropriate contouring of the centerbody boundary. The original inlets were intended to achieve these same objectives, but detailed experimental measurements indicated that a substantial reflected shock system was present. We have obtained several different redesigns which achieve approximate cancellation of the cowl shock and additional cowl-generated compression. The choice of the objective function, which is used to drive the optimization, has a significant impact on the final design. Several different formulations for the objective function have been employed, and improvements of 60% to 90% in the objective function have been achieved. This automated design system represents one of the first successful combinations of numerical optimization methods with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics simulation for high speed inlets, and demonstrates a new area in which High Performance Computing may have considerable impact on problems of military and industrial significance.

Reference-contexts: This validation process refines the physical and numerical models and also establishes an envelope in which these models can be used for design. For example, Navier-Stokes codes have been developed and used for turbomachinery design <ref> [1] </ref>. But these codes are typically used by designers, who guide the selection and shape modifications for aerodynamic shapes to achieve goals by a manual, labor intensive process requiring constant monitoring by an expert designer. The complex flows in aerodynamic applications make it unlikely to attain optimum designs manually.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a prototype software system that combines Navier-Stokes simulations and numerical optimization methods. This system has been tested by redesigning the P2 and P8 inlets. The P2, P8, and P12 inlets were designed in the 1970s for a proposed hypersonic cruise vehicle for Mach 10 to 12 <ref> [9] </ref>. Models were built at approximately 1/3 scale and tested in the NASA Ames 3.5 foot hypersonic wind tunnel. <p> Extensive experimental data were gathered and reported in a NASA technical report <ref> [9] </ref>. Since then, 2 several researchers e.g. [10, 11] have performed two-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulations of these inlets, the earliest being Knight [12]. The internal original contours were designed with the objective of providing high total pressure recovery and approximately uniform static pressure at the throat. <p> To meet this objective, it was deemed essential to cancel the incident shock (and additional compression system in the case of the P8 inlet) through surface turning at the point of impingement of the shock on the centerbody <ref> [9] </ref>. The necessary surface turning was computed using the method of characteristics in conjunction with a boundary layer model. The experimental results showed that the cowl shock was not canceled by the centerbody contour for any of the three inlets. <p> The cowl surface is unchanged, thereby yielding the same incident wave system as the original inlets. The achievement of our objective would imply an approximately uniform static pressure at the inlet throat, which is a condition generally considered desirable at the combustor entrance <ref> [9] </ref>. 2 Validation of CFD Codes The GASP (General Aerodynamic Simulation Program from Aerosoft Inc. [13]) and NPARC (Cooper and Sirbaugh [14] and [15]) codes are employed for the Navier-Stokes simulations. <p> Tables 1 and 2 show properties of each grid used in our convergence study for the original P2 and P8 inlets. In constructing the grids, the shape of the inlet is determined using spline interpolation through the (x; y) points specified in Table 1 of the NASA technical report <ref> [9] </ref>. However, the leading edge of the cowl is extended 2.79 cm upstream in order to correctly position the shock wave generated by the cowl. <p> Our grids use equal spacing in the x direction and exponential spacing in the y direction (near both the cowl and centerbody) with an upper limit on cell growth. The experimental data <ref> [9] </ref> indicate an incoming centerbody boundary layer thickness (ffi 0 ) of 1.1 cm, and Tables 1 and 2 show that the number of points our grids have in this centerbody boundary layer compares favorably with the 30 points suggested by the traditional rule of thumb. <p> This profile is used as a fixed upstream boundary condition for the CFD codes and is propagated throughout the domain to give an initial flow field for the calculations. Our flow simulations for the P2 and P8 inlets are in good agreement with experiments of NASA <ref> [9] </ref>. The pressure contours in Figures 2 and 3 show the incident and reflected shock in the original P2 and P8 inlet respectively. Figure 4 shows both the experimental and computed pitot pressure for the P8 inlet at x = 1:0414 m.
