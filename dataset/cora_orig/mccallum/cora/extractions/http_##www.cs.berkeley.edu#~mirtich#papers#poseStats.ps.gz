Abstract: In automated assembly lines, part feeders often impose a bottleneck that restricts throughput. To facilitate the design of parts and assembly lines, we'd like to estimate feedrates based on CAD models of parts. A previous paper [ 8 ] described how to predict throughput for a vision-based robotic part feeder given the distribution of part poses when parts are randomly dropped on a conveyor belt. Estimating this distribution is also useful for the design of traditional feeders such as vibratory bowls. In this paper, we describe three algorithms for estimating pose distributions. We review the quasi-static estimate reported in [ 21 ] and introduce a refinement that takes into account some measure of dynamic stability. The perturbed quasi-static estimate can be computed very rapidly and is more accurate than the quasi-static. Still more accurate are estimates based on Monte Carlo simulation using Impulse [ 12; 13 ] , although the latter comes at the penalty of increased computation time. We compare estimates from all three algorithms with physical experiments. We believe this is the first paper to systematically compare estimators with experiments using real industrial parts.

Reference-contexts: The robot arm then picks up each part and moves it into a desired final pose as illustrated in Figure 1. To facilitate rapid programming, we are developing a simulator that models feeder mechanics. Goldberg et. al. <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> outline how feeder throughput can be estimated based on estimates of pose statistics, conveyor speed, and arm cycle time. In this paper we describe several algorithms for estimating pose statistics. high-speed robot arm, and pivoting gripper. This illustration shows the system feeding car-stereo pushbuttons. <p> The authors note that the feedrate for a parts feeder is related to the probability that parts are aligned correctly when they encounter a mechanical filter and give a quasi-static estimate for the orientation of rectangular and cylindrical parts dropped at random. Similarly, the throughput analysis in <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> requires knowl edge about the distribution of poses, particularly orientation, when the parts are scattered on the flat worktable. [ 21 ] generalized and improved on the Boothroyd estimate by treating the convex hull of any polyhedral part and propagating probability from unstable faces.

Reference-contexts: This seems prohibitive for two reasons. First, the interaction between the part and environment is very collision intensive, and it is notoriously difficult to model the dynamics of collisions with friction <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> . Second, dynamic simulation is much slower than the previous described prediction algorithms, and so obtaining a statistically significant number of trials may take too long. Mirtich and Canny have studied impulse-based simula-tion, a paradigm for dynamic simulation that addresses these problems.

Finally, we discuss results from full dynamic simulation of dropped parts to obtain stochastic data. <p> In all three algorithms, we assume that the workspace is flat and much larger than X, and that X does not collide with other parts. 2 Quasi-static algorithm Our first approach to the EPS problem was proposed by Wieg-ley, et. al. The algorithm, presented in detail in <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> , is summarized here. Motion of the part is assumed to be quasi-static; inertia and velocity are neglected. After computing the part's convex hull H, the idea is to project the facets of H onto a unit sphere centered at the center of mass c. <p> Clearly, QSG is acyclic. We propagate probability along the QSG using a breadth-first traverse. The algorithm is O (n 2 ) in the number of polyhedral edges <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> . 3 Perturbed-Quasi-Static (PQS) Estimate Since the quasi-static analysis does not model dynamic disturbances, it often overestimates the probability of landing on a facet that is stable but easily dislodged by small vibration. <p> We have compared the predictions from these algorithms to physical test results, and believe that this is the first systematic comparison of pose estimators with experiments using real industrial parts. Our results indicate that a perturbed quasi-static algorithm, based on a refinement of the quasi-static algorithm presented in <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> , produces significantly more accurate results, with negligible added computation time. The perturbed quasi-static algorithm certainly has the highest accuracy to execution time ratio of all three algorithms studied.
