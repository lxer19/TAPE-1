Abstract: A new class of continuation methods is presented which, in particular, solve linear complementarity problems with copositive-plus and L fl -matrices. Let a; b 2 R n be nonnegative vectors. We embed the complementarity problem with a continuously differentiable mapping f : R n ! R n in an artificial system of equations

The classes of L fl -matrices [ 6 ] and copositive-plus matrices <ref> [ 23 ] </ref> fall in this category. Another purpose of this paper is to fill this gap. We will apply the model (c) to LCP [M ; q] with an L fl -matrix M and a copositive-plus matrix M . 4 2. <p> (26) and the boundedness of the set S of solutions (x; y; ) of (25) with &gt; 0, we need to impose appropriate assumptions on the mapping g. 18 Such an extension is especially useful when we deal with the problem LCP [M ; q] associated with a bimatrix game <ref> [ 23 ] </ref> , where M and q are of the form M = O A # Let a 0, and Then we can easily verify that (26) has a unique solution and that the set S of all solutions (x; y; ) of (25) is bounded.
