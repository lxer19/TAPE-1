Title: The Algebraic Structure of Pencils and Block Toeplitz Matrices 1  
Author: Daniel L. Boley 
Abstract: We prove several results majorizing the sequences of Kronecker and/or Jordan indices obtainable after small perturbations to a given matrix pencil. The proofs are simple consequences of a theory of majorization for semi-infinite integer sequences, developed in this paper. In particular, new simple bounds are proved on the indices obtainable after appending a single row or column to a matrix pencil. This corresponds to bounding the controllability and/or observabil-ity indices after adding a single input or a single output to a linear time-invariant dynamical system.

Reference-contexts: In Sec. 4 below, we present these results, extending the results of [8] to general pencils, not necessarily semi-regular. Several papers discuss the effect of perturbations of pencils on the indices, or the structure of the Kronecker indices reachable in the closure of the orbit of a pencil. In <ref> [2] </ref>, the effect on the Jordan indices for the eigenvalues of a matrix lying within a region of the complex plane under perturbations to a pencil was discussed. <p> This stratification is used to determine which structures are reachable by arbitrarily small perturbations to given pencils and furthermore to produce the specific perturbation needed for each case. In <ref> [2] </ref>, they consider the sequence of Jordan indices in descending order for a matrix M, or actually a general class of (linear) operators. <p> A typical result, expressed for matrix polynomials, is Theorem 4 <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> We remark that this theorem was proved in <ref> [2] </ref> for the case where e n K = n K , but generalized to eigenvalues lying within a contour of the complex plane. <p> It always the case that g 1 e g 1 (otherwise it would be that G k &lt; e G k for some sufficiently large index k). But the case where the number of right Kronecker blocks remains unchanged is of particular interest. This was the case proved in <ref> [2] </ref>, but generalized to eigenalues within a contour on the complex plane. A particular example of this is the ordinary eigenvalue problem in which there are no Kronecker indices, as illustrated above with M.

If the rank (E sF ) equals the normal rank of the pencil E F , then the order of the smallest Kronecker block is the smallest k such that the right nullity of A k+1 is bigger than zero. <p> The first nonzero nullity appears for k + 1 = 4. This "corner" in the A curve at k = 3 corresponds to the order of the smallest right Kronecker block, namely 3. Following the proof in <ref> [6] </ref>, we can deflate out the smallest Kronecker block, removing the "corner" in Fig. 1 at k = 3; the effect on the curve is to subtract k 3 from A k for all k &gt; 3.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The close links between the concepts of Controllability, Reachability, and Observability of linear time-invariant dynamical systems on the one hand, and Kronecker, Jordan indices of appropriate matrix pencils on the other hand have been well established in the literature (see e.g. <ref> [7, 12] </ref>). Though the complete structure of the Kronecker canonical form (KCF) is often not required, it has been found that the detailed structure of the KCF is needed in order to compute transmission zeroes or to know which zeroes may be placed by suitable inputs [5, 1].

Reference-contexts: collected for each eigenvalue in descending order, are known as the Segre characteristics [11, p79-81] The relation of these to the so-called Weyr characterstics (the nullities of (M sI) k , for k = 1; 2; 3; : : :, where M is a square matrix, [11]) was extended in <ref> [8] </ref> to the case of semi-regular pencils, based on the fact that the Weyr characterstics are also exactly the nullities of the block Toeplitz matrices (2). <p> The analogous construction (1) was used earlier by [6] to prove many basic properties for the Kronecker canonical form, including its existence.

The remaining features shown in Fig. 1 will be developed in Sec. 4 In <ref> [8] </ref>, a similar construction was used to relate the Jordan indices for eigenvalue zero to the block Toeplitz matrices (2). Any other eigenvalue can be handled by a suitable shift s as in (E sF)F . <p> Analogous to the above discussion for Kronecker blocks, the smallest Jordan block for eigenvalue zero is the smallest k such that the rank of G k+1 is strictly greater than (k+1) rank (E). In <ref> [8] </ref>, this result was used to prove relations between the Segre characteristics and the Weyr characteristics for a semi-regular pencil. There are many ways to describe the relationships between the between the Segre characteristics and the Weyr characteristics, but perhaps the simplest is the following.

Let a = fa 1 ; a 2 ; : : :g denote a semi-infinite sequence of integers. We implicitly define a i = 0 for all i 0. <p> If the first majorization is strict, then so is the second, among the finite entries. Proof: in the appendix. An analog of this theorem for descending sequences appeared in <ref> [9] </ref> for the case of "strong" majorization. This case can be proved as a special case of Theorem 9, or proved directly using the analog of Lemma 8. We now state and prove a theorem on weak majorization for descending sequences.

That is, we restate a result which guarantees when given Kronecker structure is reachable from a given pencil via arbitrarily small perturbations in terms of conditions on the sequences of nullities. <p> In view the Theorem 26, this value is also a lower bound on the perturbation to (13) needed to obtain a pencil whose orbit-closure does not contain the original given pencil (13). This deserves further investigation. 6.2 Types of Fundamental Transitions The proof in <ref> [10] </ref> of the result cited above was based on proving that one can always apply at least one of the transitions described below to the original pencil such that the sequences of nullities of the resulting intermediate pencil still majorize the corresponding sequences of the target perturbed pencil. <p> The transition KL-&gt;J (not shown) would have the effect of adding a new corner to the G sequence. The other transitions would have effect analogous to those for the A sequence, moving corners around in appropriate ways. To prove Theorem 3, Pokrzywa <ref> [10] </ref> proved that if one is given "source" and "target" sequences of nullities corresponding to two valid pencil configurations, where the source sequence majorizes the target sequence, then a sequence of transitions of exactly the types outlined above can be applied to the source pencil to reach the target pencil.
