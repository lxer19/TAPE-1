Title: Sensor Based Planning for a Planar Rod Robot: Incremental Construction of the Planar Rod-HGVG  
Author: Howie Choset and Brian Mirtich and Joel Burdick 
Abstract: This work considers sensor based motion planning for rod-shaped robots in unknown environments. The motion planning scheme is based on the rod hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (rod-HGVG). The rod-HGVG is a roadmap for rod-like robots, and is an extension of a prior roadmap for point-like robots. We give an incremental method to construct the rod-HGVG, thereby enabling exploration of unknown environments. An important practical feature of the algorithm is its sole reliance upon the use of work space distance measurements to objects that are within line of sight. Such measurements can be readily provided by conventional range sensors. Moreover, motion planning in a configuration space is achieved without explicitly constructing each configuration space obstacle. A key result derived in this paper is the distance gradient between two convex sets.

Reference-contexts: This paper focuses on the incremental construction procedure of the rod-HGVG. The approach, described in this paper, is based on the point-HGVG incremental construction procedure <ref> [3] </ref>. The advantage of the point-HGVG incremental procedure is that it uses only line of sight information and functions in non-planar environments. The drawback of the point-HGVG procedure is that it assumes distance measuresments are made in a configuration space (or some parameterization of it). <p> This incremental construction procedure is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 Rod Distance Function Definition 4.1 (Rod) A rod R is a line segment of length L that has two end points P and Q. The configuration space of the rod is SE (2) (SE (2) ' R 2 fiS 1 ). <p> Both of these structures can be incremen tally constructed using only line of sight information in a fashion similar to the incremental construction of point-GVG edges described in <ref> [3] </ref>. Just like the point-GVG edges, the rod-GVG edges are traced in an incremental manner using an adaptation of numerical continuation techniques [7]. <p> Practically speaking, this result states that the numerical procedure defined by Equation (8) will be robust for reasonable errors in robot position, sensor errors, and numerical round off. 6.2.2 R-edges The incremental construction of the R-edges requires a slight modification of the already existing point-GVG incremental edge construction procedure <ref> [3] </ref>. The prediction step is identical: the rod robot takes a step in the tangent direction of a point-GVG edge.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Sensor based planning makes use of sensor information reflecting the current state of the environment, in contrast to classical planning, which assumes full knowledge of the environment prior to planning. Recent work <ref> [4] </ref> includes the definition of a new roadmap structure termed the rod hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (rod-HGVG) which serves as a basis for sensor based planning for a rod shaped robot operating in the plane. <p> A limitation of these roadmaps is that distance measurements are assumed to be made in a configuration space (or some parameterization of it). Previous work <ref> [4] </ref> introduces the rod-HGVG, which is a configuration space roadmap defined in terms of workspace distance measurements which are obtainable from realistic sensors. This paper focuses on the incremental construction procedure of the rod-HGVG.

Reference-contexts: planning methods are limited because: (1) many are based on heuristic algorithms, and it is therefore impossible to prove if they will work in all possible environments; (2) proof of convergence for other algorithms is limited to the case of a point in two-dimensional environments (for example, Lumelsky's "bug" algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>); or (3) the robot is assumed to be a point in configuration space, where its sensors can measure distance in configuration space. The rod-HGVG is based upon the generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD) which was aplied to motion planning of a disk by O'Dunlaing and Yap [12].

Note that the gradient in Equation (16) depends upon the choice of a body-fixed coordinate frame; this reflects the lack of bi-invariance in SE (2) and SE (3).

Reference-contexts: The predictor step moves the robot for a small distance along the tangent of the rod-GVG. The tangent direction is the null space of r y G rod <ref> [16] </ref>. Since r y G rod comprises distance information, it can be readily computed with line of sight sensor information. Typically, the prediction step takes the robot off of a rod-GVG edge, so a correction procedure is required to bring the robot back to the rod-GVG.
