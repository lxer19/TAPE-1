Abstract: Some of the problems which emerge when wireless access to high speed (ATM) networks is considered are identified and discussed. As actually standards for wireless LANs (IEEE 802.11, HIPERLAN) are only emerging we have stressed especially the question whether approaches defined in these standards seem to be suitable for future use as access technologies. Difficulties occurring in this context have been illustrated with results of simulational studies.

Reference-contexts: HIPERLAN offers a transmission rate of 23,5294 Mbit/s. Wireless Access to High Speed Networks 5 3.2 IEEE 802.11 The IEEE 802.11 draft standard <ref> [1] </ref> is basically a Carrier Sense Multiple Access Protocol, i.e. after the carrier has been sensed idle a station, that intends to transmit waits for a random backoff time and starts transmitting if no other station started meanwhile. <p> When using packets of 53 byte length, the maximum total throughput is around 32%. A promising approach concerning the handling of short packets can be seen in the concept for segmentation of long MSDUs in the draft standard <ref> [1] </ref>. Once a station succeeded in the backoff phase, it is allowed to transmit all remaining fragments of the MSDU after the Short Interframe Space (SIFS), which is normally only used for answering purposes (e.g. for CTS after RTS, DATA after POLL).

Reference-contexts: Not all the possible combinations of the different features have been found to be equally interesting. In fact recently a lot of work is being done to provide global mobility with modem-type speed in using the rapidly proliferating digital mobile telephone technology as in the CDPD-approach <ref> [2] </ref>. On the other hand in order to support global, disruptive data service, concepts for the mobile IP have been discussed very intensively [3].

Reference-contexts: Second, some packets have to travel via more than one wireless link to their destination. As wireless links are known as error-prone this increases the risk of errors. In order to investigate the influence of introducing forwarding we have investigated two scenarios depicted in figure <ref> [5] </ref>. Both scenarios examine either traffic from or to a single terminal which is without radio range of a second cluster. Please note that we have chosen such artificially terminal configuration in order to stresses the problems one has to be aware of in the case of forwarding.

Reference-contexts: They combine a local mobility with a high data rate. An overview about WLAN-products currently on the market <ref> [7] </ref> lists datarates from 860 Kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s and operation ranges between 600 to 800 ft.

Reference-contexts: In [21] the authors present the design of a wireless broadband ad-hoc ATM local area network. In this approach they use pre-determined virtual paths between all base stations and source and destination home station in order to provide mobility. In <ref> [9] </ref> the authors introduce a new concept referred to as the virtual connection tree. This approach avoids the need to involve the network call processor for every cell handoff attempt.

Reference-contexts: The proposed channel throughputs range from 1 to 2 Mbit/s. 4 STRATEGIES OF INTERCONNECTION The question of interconnecting wired, static networks of different kind with ATM has been extensively discussed in <ref> [12] </ref>. Therefore we will not repeat this concentrating on the particularities caused by the wireless technology and the mobility aspect. Generally there are two thinkable strategies to interconnect wireless LANs and high-speed ATM networks the 'IP-approach' (see Figure 1) and the 'native-ATM-approach' (see Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: This means that in case of a handoff the connection path has to be rerouted. In the latter alternative the end-point of an ATM connection has to be changed [20]. In the literature one can identify some approaches dealing with these problems. <ref> [14] </ref> shows that a hitless path-switch in ATM networks is possible at least on demand without major modifications to the existing ATM node concepts.

Reference-contexts: A continuous service is only possible in the case of overlapping cells. Further, sophisticated algorithms are needed which prepare the handoff so that the connection is not disrupted when the mobile host leaves the radio range of its recent base station. One such algorithm is discussed in <ref> [15] </ref>. In the case of none overlapping cells one has to attack the problems of in sequence transmission of the ATM cells and buffering of ATM cells as long as the mobile host in not within radio range of any base station.

Reference-contexts: It does not seem likely that a multimedia application will be continuously used in a large area, calling for global mobility support! The bandwidth requirements of the currently multimedia applications do not exceed a few megabits per second <ref> [19] </ref>. Within the above mentioned scenarios several stations will be simultaneously sending within a single picocell.
