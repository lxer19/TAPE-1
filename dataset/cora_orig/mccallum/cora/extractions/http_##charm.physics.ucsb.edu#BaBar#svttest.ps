Reference-contexts: For the purposes of testing, we have decided to control the VME processor from a remote Unix workstation through a transparent RPC bridge based on software developed for CDF silicon detector test stands <ref> [1] </ref>. The user interacts with this package through an easy to use graphical interface based on Tcl-Tk, see Figure 13. Immediate feed-back is provided by on-line histograms generated using the HistScope package [2]. The data can also be written out to a file for o*ine analysis.
