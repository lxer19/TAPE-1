Abstract: This paper describes a usability study of the Hypertext navigation facilities provided by two popular World Wide Web client applications (also termed `browsers'). We detail the navigation tools provided by the clients and describe their underlying page retrieval models. We introduce a notation that represents the system states resulting from the user's navigation actions in World Wide Web subspaces. The notation is used to analyse the client applications. We find that the client user interfaces present a model of navigation that conflicts with the underlying stack-based system model.

Reference-contexts: Stack-based Navigation The clients' Forward and Back buttons do not control browsing of a temporal ordering of previously visited pages, but rather determine the currently displayed page in a stack of pages. This has also been highlighted by Brown and Shillner <ref> [1] </ref>. At the top of the stack is the page that has been most recently loaded. At the bottom of stack is the page that was least recently loaded. The stack of recallable pages is termed History-list in Mosaic and Go list in Netscape.

Reference-contexts: It has recently been reported by 1 Netscape Communications Corporation, 501 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View, CA 94043. 2 NCSA Mosaic is a product of the Software Development Group of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Catledge and Pitkow <ref> [2] </ref> that Mosaic accounts for 53% of all WWW related access to HTTP servers. We include Netscape in the study because it is widely regarded as a popular successor to Mosaic. The number of commercial and non-commercial WWW browsers available is increasing rapidly. <p> Catledge and Pitkow <ref> [2] </ref> found that selection of hyperlinks and use of the back command accounted for 93% of all navigational activity in their study of WWW browsing strategies. One explanation for this may be that users backtrack to a page several times in order to investigate links within it. <p> The two parts of the study focus on the usage of the Back function of the browsers. This function has been identified as the most common technique of page display using system provided navigation functions (discounting link selection) <ref> [2] </ref>. Task 1 investigates the accuracy of users' models of page availablility when pages are removed from the History-list. Task 2 investigates the accuracy of those models when pages appear repeatedly in the History-list. The Subjects. Eleven subjects were studied. <p> No subjects investigated the history list to support their answer to the navigation question posed in Task 1. This may imply a lack of awareness of the feedback provided by the History-list with regards to the accessibility of pages. This is supported by Catledge and Pitkow <ref> [2] </ref>, who found that History-list access to WWW pages accounted for a very small proportion of all page accesses. A learning effect accounts for some interesting observations in Task 2. There are two sides to the learning effect.

Reference-contexts: Using the notation, with reference to a sample WWW subspace, we analyse system behaviour in certain browsing scenarios. This analysis reveals system behaviour that, we contend, is likely to exacerbate users' feelings of being `lost in hyperspace' <ref> [3] </ref>, and cause them difficulties in navigating WWW subspaces. The usability study reported later in this paper supports this contention. A Notation for Browsing The navigational features of the client applications can be described more formally by use of the following notation.

Reference-contexts: Catledge and Pitkow [2] that Mosaic accounts for 53% of all WWW related access to HTTP servers. We include Netscape in the study because it is widely regarded as a popular successor to Mosaic. The number of commercial and non-commercial WWW browsers available is increasing rapidly. Kent <ref> [4] </ref> provides an overview of currently available browsers, most of which adopt similar schemes to Mosaic and Netscape. This section describes the navigation functions available in Mosaic and Netscape. Classes of Page Display The browsers support similar models of navigation: that is, the designers' models are almost equivalent.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The smallest of usability problems, when multiplied across thousands or millions of users, becomes a source of massive inefficiency and untold frustration <ref> [7] </ref>. With the rapid increase of Internet usage, particularly of the World Wide Web (WWW), it is clear that popular WWW client applications (also termed browsers) such as Netscape and Mosaic are highly susceptible to this problem of escalating errors.

Reference-contexts: With the rapid increase of Internet usage, particularly of the World Wide Web (WWW), it is clear that popular WWW client applications (also termed browsers) such as Netscape and Mosaic are highly susceptible to this problem of escalating errors. Nielsen and Sano <ref> [8] </ref> estimate that "it costs the world economy about half a million dollars in lost user productivity every time we add one more design elements (sic) to Sun's home page." If a single home page can induce losses of this scale, then the most trifling of usability flaws in the clients <p> They direct page designers to consider the distance of information from home pages, and the provision of indexes to support efficient use of such strategies. Well considered page design will help support users in effective and efficient navigation through the WWW <ref> [8] </ref>, but no set of page design style-guides or other techniques will be adopted unilaterally across the web. We believe that the effects of poor page design can be ame liorated by improved support for navigation in WWW browsers.
