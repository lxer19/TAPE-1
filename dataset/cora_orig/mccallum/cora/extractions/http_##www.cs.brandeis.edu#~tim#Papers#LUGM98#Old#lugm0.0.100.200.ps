Reference-contexts: Typically such test code is not interactive. An interactive test loop can take a significant amount of code that can be unique for each class. While a testing tool, such as JUnit <ref> [1] </ref> may make writing test cases easier, it may not be interactive enough to fully diagnose a problem. Below we give an example of a session in which the user has tested some of the methods and constructors from a Java program.

Reference-contexts: The Scheme primitives are stored in their own class so that it would be easy to switch from R4RS to R5RS <ref> [2] </ref> scheme primitives. Once these class design issues are out of the way, the rest is pretty easy. In order to build a Scheme interpreter, you basically need six things: 1. Read and write. The reader goes in the InputPort class.
