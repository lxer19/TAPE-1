Abstract: We consider the M=M=c queue, where customers transfer to a critical state when their queueing(sojourn) time exceeds a random time. Lower and upper bounds for the distribution of the number of critical jobs are derived from two modifications of the original system. The two modified systems can be efficiently solved. Numerical calculations indicate the power of the approach. 1. Introduction. We consider an M ()=M ()=c queue, where customers transfer to a critical state when their queueing(sojourn) time exceeds a random time. This

Reference-contexts: It follows that the class of discrete probability measures f T ; T = 0; 1; : : :g on S = f (m; n) 2 N 2 g is tight. Consequently, by Pro-horovs theorem (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>, Theorem 6.1) the class f T g is relatively compact, meaning that each subsequence T n 0 contains a further subsequence T n 00 that converges weakly to some discrete probability measure ~ on S.

Reference-contexts: The Markov reward technique used in the present paper to establish computable bounds is also a powerful tool to prove qualitative properties, like e.g. monotonicity properties in queueing networks (cf. [13]) or optimality of routing policies to parallel queues (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>). The model with an additional input stream of jobs which are critical from the beginning has been studied by De Waal [12] and Van Rooij [11]. They use this model to describe corrective and preventive maintenance of components in an installation like, e.g., a plant at an oil refinery.

For the determination of R efficient algorithms have been developed (see, e.g., <ref> [9] </ref>). From the equilibrium distribution T it is now straightforward to determine global performance characteristics. For instance, for L u T we find, by inserting (3), that L u 1 X n n c1 X n n T (I R) 2 e + (c 1) c 5. Numerical results.

In this section we briefly describe the analysis of the upper bound model, which is based on the matrix geometric theory developed by Neuts <ref> [10] </ref>. The analysis of the lower bound model is identical (and therefore not included). The upper bound model can be described by an irreducible Markov process with states (m; n), where m is the number of non-critical jobs in the system and n the number of critical ones. <p> Note that the generator A 0 + A 1 + A 2 is irreducible, so we can conclude from (the continuous time version of) Theorem 1.5.1 in <ref> [10] </ref> that n T R nc ; n c ;(3) where the matrix R (the so-called rate-matrix) is characterized as the minimal non negative solution of the matrix quadratic equation A 0 + RA 1 + R 2 A 2 = 0 : The vectors b T and c T follow
