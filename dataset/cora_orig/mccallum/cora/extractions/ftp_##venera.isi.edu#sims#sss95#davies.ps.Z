Abstract: Agent-Based Knowledge Discovery provides a new technique for performing data-mining over distributed databases. By combining techniques from Distributed AI and Machine Learning, software agents equipped with learning algorithms mine local databases. These agents then cooperate to integrate the knowledge obtained, before presenting the results to the user. We are currently exploring the use of a new software agent language, Agent-K and the application of first order learning techniques to data-mining. However, the main area of investigation is how the agents should interact, and how the knowledge should be integrated.

Reference-contexts: Failures result in communication with other agents which are passed subgoals, which are then treated as tasks. Both MALE and ANIMALS used propositional learning methods. First Order Knowledge Discovery Some ILP systems have been applied to data-mining. One example is ENIGMA <ref> (Bergadano, Giordana & Saitta, 1991) </ref>, which learnt fault diagnosis rules based on mechanical vibration data. Another is GOLEM (Muggleton, King & Sternberg, 1992), which learnt rules that predicted structural features in new proteins from existing protein data.

Reference-contexts: MALE (Sian, 1991) is a homogeneous, blackboard-based system. Each agent has a data-source and a clustering algorithm. The agents propose rules which characterise the data and critique other agents' proposals. Eventually a consensus about the knowledge extracted from the data is reached. ANIMALS <ref> (Edwards & Davies, 1993) </ref> is a heterogeneous multi-agent learning system. Each agent has local knowledge and either an inductive or deductive learning algorithm. Agents attempt to solve a problemsolving task by either retrieving the knowledge required, or by using learning to acquire it.

Reference-contexts: Preliminary Work To date we have tackled the following issues: the nature of the agent architecture; and the possible interactions between the agents during the data-mining process. Agent-K The first step in designing our agent was to modify Agent-0 (Shoham, 1990) to use KQML <ref> (Finin et al., 1993) </ref> communication performatives. This is detailed in Davies & Edwards (1994). We hope to extend Agent-K to use the Knowledge Interchange Format and Ontolingua ontologies (Patil et al., 1992). This would allow our discovery agents to share knowledge with other KSE-based agents.

Reference-contexts: If agents interact upon completion of learning, knowledge integration may be computationally intensive. Another question is how agents should be selected to work on a given discovery goal. This might be addressed by the work on Site Description Languages <ref> (Levy, Sagiv & Srivastava, 1994) </ref>. Our long term goal is that agent-based knowledge discovery will allow distributed databases to be mined in a distributed manner: maximising the usage of distributed computing resources, and minimising network traffic.

Related Work Multi-Agent Learning A number of cooperative distributed learning systems have been produced. MALE (Sian, 1991) is a homogeneous, blackboard-based system. Each agent has a data-source and a clustering algorithm. <p> However, the learning techniques used for both are similar, and ILP algorithms in particular appear to make little distinction between revising clauses in response to new examples, and combining two sets of clauses and then revising them to fit the existing examples <ref> (Pazzani & Kibler, 1992) </ref>. Our initial decision to use an ILP learning algorithm was based on the insight that many ILP algorithms provide support for theory revision and knowledge integration. An agent based on such an algorithm could be used to both induce and integrate knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Distributed Database Mining One approach which has emerged for mining distributed databases is to use a distributed database manager to provide seamless integration of the distributed data to data-mining algorithms <ref> (Simoudis, 1994) </ref>. Our approach differs in that communication traffic between agents is restricted to the exchange of knowledge. Preliminary Work To date we have tackled the following issues: the nature of the agent architecture; and the possible interactions between the agents during the data-mining process.

We also plan to replace the basic Agent-0 interpreter with a variation on PLACA <ref> (Thomas, 1993) </ref>, which would provide agents with a planning capability. Agents would thus have a means to plan interaction amongst themselves and with other KSE agents. We believe that Agent-K has already been a success, as it has demonstrated that the AOP approach is compatible with that of KQML.
