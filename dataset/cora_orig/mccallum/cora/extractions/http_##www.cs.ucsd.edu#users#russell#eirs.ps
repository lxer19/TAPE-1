Abstract: Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson [2] discuss the circuit depth complexity of n bit Boolean functions constructed by composing up to d = log n= log log n levels of k = log n bit boolean functions. Any such function is in AC 1 . They conjecture that circuit depth is additive under composition, which would imply that any (bounded fan-in) circuit for this problem requires dk 2 (log 2 n= log log n) depth. This would separate AC 1 from NC 1 . They recommend using the communication game characterization of circuit depth [3]. In order to develop techniques for using communications complexity to prove circuit lower bounds, they suggest an intermediate communications complexity problem which they call the Universal Composition Relation. We give an almost optimal lower bound of dk O(d 2 (k log k) 1=2 ) for this problem. In addition, we present a proof, directly in terms of communication complexity, that there is a function on k bits requiring (k) circuit depth. Although this fact can be easily established using a counting argument, we hope that the ideas in our proof will be incorporated more easily into subsequent arguments which use communication complexity to prove circuit depth bounds.

Reference-contexts: If this same bound were proven for the Iterated Multiplexor Function, it would yield an (log n q log log n ) bound on circuit depth by setting d = * k logk for a suitable constant * &gt; 0. Using different (and highly interesting) techniques, H-astad and Wigderson <ref> [1] </ref> obtained a lower bound of dk 2 O (d) . This is better for small values of d. The goal now, in order to separate AC 1 from N C 1 is to use these techniques to prove the lower bound for the Iterated Multiplexor function. <p> Player P 0 is given (v 0 ; f ) and player P 1 is given (v 1 ; f ). The players' goal is to find an index i 2 <ref> [1; k] </ref> for which the vectors are different. In fact, this is the Iterated Multiplexor Game for d = 1 in which the adversary promises to give the same function to both players. It is the R f game, when f is part of the input. <p> Applying it to t = k2 log c bits of communication, by property 2, after no more than V still contains at least three vectors. At this point, the communication game is over and the protocol must specify an index 2 <ref> [1; k] </ref> for which the vectors v 0 and v 1 are different. At least two of the three vectors in V have the same bit at the specified index. One of these two vectors is given to the A-player and the other to the B-player.

Reference-contexts: In this notation, CC (R f ) = Depth (f ). Based on this characterization, Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson <ref> [2] </ref> sketched a plan of attack for proving a super-logarithmic lower bound for the circuit depth required to compute a specific function in P . (In fact, the function is in AC 1 ). This function, which we will refer to as the Iterated Multiplexor, can be described as follows. <p> Hence, if there are d = log n= log log n levels of these, then the necessary ciruit depth should be approximately dk 2 (log 2 n= log log n) . Proving that circuit depth is additive under composition seems extremely difficult. Therefore, <ref> [2] </ref> suggested an abstraction of the communication game for the Composition of Functions. They call this game the Universal Composition Relation, since any protocol solving this problem will also solve the associated communication game for any composition of functions.

Reference-contexts: It follows that 8v 2 V; 9a v 2 f0; 1g; 8f 2 F 0 ; [b v;f 2 fa v ; flg]. This completes step 1. For step 2, we use the following result from extremal set theory: Lemma 12 ([Sauer, <ref> [4] </ref>]) Let S f0; 1g n , jSj P d n . Then there exist a set of d coordi nates on which the projection of S is the whole d-cube. 19 We view F 0 as a subset of f0; 1g V .

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2 ([([KW])]) CC (R f ) = D (f ). The following is from <ref> [5] </ref>. It is proved using a counting argument, comparing the number of Boolean circuits of depth d to the number of functions on f0; 1g k . Theorem 3 Let f be a randomly chosen Boolean function on f0; 1g k . <p> Theorem 5 The Same Function 1-Multiplexor Game requires (log jU j) bits of communication. In particular, for U = f0; 1g k , (k) bits are needed. Note that Theorem 5 can be proved by a simple counting argument. Riordan and Shannon in 1942 <ref> [5] </ref> prove there are many more functions in f0; 1g f0;1g k than there are circuits with depth O (k). Since CC (R f ) = Depth (f ), it follows that there are functions with high communication complexity. <p> It is not difficult to see that the converse is also true; a lower bound for the Same Function 1-Multiplexor Game yields , within a constant factor, a matching bound for R f for some f . However, the counting argument of <ref> [5] </ref> is notorious for yielding no intuition for constructing hard functions. Hopefully, our new techniques will provide new insight especially when combined with other communication complexity type proofs.
