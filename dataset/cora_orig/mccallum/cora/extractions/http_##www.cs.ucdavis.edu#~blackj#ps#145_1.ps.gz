Abstract: Problem 2.5 Theorem: 8S f1; 2; : : :; 3ng such that jSj = n + 1; 9fa; bg S such that ja bj 2: Proof: Make n equivalence classes where the classes are induced by di=3e; 1 i 3n. Notice that for any a; b in a class, ja bj 2. By the pigeonhole principle, at least 2 members of S must occur in some class. Therefore, there always exists a pair fa; bg S with ja bj 2.
