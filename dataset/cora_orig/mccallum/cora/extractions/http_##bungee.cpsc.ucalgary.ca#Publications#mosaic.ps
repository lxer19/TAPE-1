Abstract: The ATM-TN TeleSim project has designed and implemented a synthetic workload model for Internet mosaic traffic, to be used as input to a parallel simulator for high speed ATM networks. This paper describes the workload characterization and modeling process for this synthetic workload model, as well as the design, implementation, and validation of this traffic model.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose, good resource discovery and navigation tools are needed. One of the most popular resource discovery tools for navigating the Internet is mosaic <ref> (Andreessen 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Measurements were collected using techniques similar to those reported in the literature (Claffy 1994; Paxson 1994; Paxson and Floyd 1994). This section describes the network measurement and workload characterization process. For all network traffic measurements, the trace collection facility was tcpdump <ref> (Jacobson et al. 1989) </ref>. Tcp-dump is a software network monitor that provides user-level control of trace collection, including filtering on a host, protocol, or port basis.

Reference-contexts: The transfer of one file must complete before the transfer of the next file begins. Mosaic provides full TCP/IP based communications support, including HTTP, Gopher, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol), WAIS (Wide Area Information Server), Archie, finger, and whois <ref> (Obraczka et al. 1993) </ref>. It is also possible to mail documents from mosaic using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and to telnet to various servers (An-dreessen 1993).

Reference-contexts: The HTTP protocol is an application layer protocol that defines the rules for exchanging HTML documents between WWW sites. HTTP uses TCP as its transport layer protocol <ref> (Tanenbaum 1988) </ref>. TCP is a connection-oriented transport protocol that provides reliable byte stream delivery between two hosts on the Internet. A single HTML document can result in multiple TCP connections, one for each file that appears as part of the WWW page.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents data only for WWW traffic (i.e., HTTP traffic that uses TCP port 80), representing 5.5% of the total byte and packet network traffic in the four day trace. An analysis of the complete TCP traces is presented in <ref> (Zhu 1994) </ref>. A total of 7070 WWW-related TCP connections were recorded in the first set of traces. These connections accounted for 97 Megabytes of data transferred on the network, for a mean of 14,380 bytes per TCP connection.
