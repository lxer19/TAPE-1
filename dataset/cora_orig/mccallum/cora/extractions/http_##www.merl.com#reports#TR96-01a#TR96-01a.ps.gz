Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of applying ATM technology in designing distributed industrial plant control applications with integrated real-time communication requirements. In particular, we first examine (1) the design space using current ATM service categories and their corresponding traffic models, and (2) the mathematical and practical implications of the traffic models. We then present a taxonomy of the algorithms available to implement the service categories that can provide performance guarantees. Through the examination, we shed light on the gap between what is usually assumed in research and what the actual ATM network will provide. We then show how real-time communication can be mapped onto ATM service categories, and demonstrate the limitations of ATM services. Finally, we describe the concept of User Level Multiplexing as a means to overcome the limitations.

Reference-contexts: Here research is needed to close the gap between what real-time and multimedia application designer needs and what the ATM network actually provides. Research at the middleware level deals with problems of QoS map-ping, user level multiplexing, transport protocols, connection management, and adaptive QoS management <ref> [1, 16] </ref>. Middleware level research also needs to address the design of QoS based API that can provide real-time programming services and interface to the applications. Effective research at the middleware level requires a thorough understanding of what is provided by the communication services in an ATM network.

Reference-contexts: In figure 1, we illustrate this concept. There are five service categories currently defined by the ATM Forum Traffic Management Subworking Group <ref> [2] </ref>, namely CBR (Constant Bit Rate), rt-VBR (real-time Variable Bit Rate), nrt-VBR (non-real-time Variable Bit Rate), ABR (Available Bit Rate), and UBR (Unspecified Bit Rate). Traffic control will be applied to meet QoS requirements of applications using these services.

Reference-contexts: Let's analyze the properties of traffic generated from a rt-VBR connection V C i . Given the three traffic parameters of V C i , i.e., PCR i , SCR i and MBS i , at the traffic source we can derive (1) the traffic contraint function <ref> [3] </ref>, (2) the minimum interval between maximum bursts of cells, and (3) the maximum earliness of a cell. <p> deterministic traffic model ensures that only a fixed number of leaky buckets is needed by the virtual scheduler for cell transmission at a source (e.g., in the network interface card for a workstation) and by the traffic policer at the UNI (User Network Interface) or NNI (Network to Network Interface) <ref> [3] </ref>. Since a leaky bucket can be implemented with one counter and a single timer [17], the traffic model is thus simple enough to enable the network traffic to be monitored and controlled in real-time at ATM data rates.

Reference-contexts: There has been a lot of research done at the ATM network level. Research at this level is concerned with traffic specification models, CAC (Connection Admission Control) algorithms, and cell scheduling algorithms that can provide deterministic or statistical real-time guarantees for video, audio and data traffic types <ref> [5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 18, 21, 20, 25] </ref>. Network level research also addresses new protocols and service models, such as the work presented in [7, 22, 24]. Research at the middleware level has just begun. <p> Although Virtual Clock and PGPS are rate-based 4 scheduling algorithms, lately it has been shown that they can also provide delay guarantees to connections <ref> [5, 18] </ref>. However, not all DP algorithms are equal in (1) their efficiency to utilize the network bandwidth while providing inidividual delay bounds, (2) their CAC calculation, and their implementation complexity. <p> the following: | In the calculation of the priority (e.g., the virtual clock value in the Virtual Clock algorithm) for each arriving packet/cell, rate-based algorithms only needs the previous priority value (which may depend on the arrival time of the previous cell) and an algorithm dependant constant as described in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> On the other hand, rate-based dynamic priority algorithms are very attractive. In addition to supporting individual priorities and the firewall property, another advantage of rate-based algorithms is that there exist methods to determine end-to-end delay bounds in heterogeneous networks. In <ref> [5] </ref>, a class of Guaranteed Rate (GR) scheduling algorithms was defined, and a method for determining an upper bound on the end-to-end delays for a network of switches each of which employs a scheduling algorithm in the GR class was developed.

For future research, we are continuing to address the issues of evaluating User Level Multiplexing algorithms for both local and distributed applications, and analyzing their performance and implementation implications.

Reference-contexts: This is particularly attractive since we cannot require all the network vendors to use the same scheduling algorithm. Moreover, there is evidence that it will be feasible to search a queue of cells electronically in the near future <ref> [11] </ref>, therefore we postulate that rate-based dynamic priority algorithms will be employed for future CBR and rt-VBR traffic. In this section, we have presented a taxonomy of the scheduling algorithms that can be used to implement CBR and rt-VBR service categories to provide deterministic guarantees.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In this paper, we consider the problem of applying ATM technology in designing distributed industrial plant control applications with integrated real-time communication requirements <ref> [12] </ref>. In such a real-time application environment, many types of communication, including plant monitoring data, operator command and control, video, images and audio, must be accommodated. Traditionally, such distributed plant control systems have been built mostly with proprietary network components. Real-time constraints are met with physical isolation of sub-networks.
