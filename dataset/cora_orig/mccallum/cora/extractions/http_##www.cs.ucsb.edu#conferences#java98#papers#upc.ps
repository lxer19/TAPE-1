Abstract: Universal Personal Computing (UPC) supports nomadic computing on the Internet by allowing mobile users to access their personalized computing resources anywhere on the Internet using any available terminal. Since UPC must deal with heterogeneous systems in a mobile environment, independence of computing pla t-forms and support of portable objects are imperative, which leads to the choice of Java. The system is mo d-eled as distributed objects with CORBA as the common bus that facilitates distribution, interfacing, and int e-gration of the objects. The combination of Java and CORBA constitutes an ideal env ironment for UPC.

Reference-contexts: In such an environment, nomadic computing should provide independence of location, of motion, of platform and with widespread presence of access to remote files, systems and ser vices <ref> [2] </ref>. In other words, the essence of such a computing paradigm is to retain ones personal computing e n-vironments and access capabilities wherever one happens to be.

Reference-contexts: The calling object does not even have to know the location of the invoked object provided the object reference is known. This model fits well into UPC since it essentially provides a homogeneous distributed processing environment. CORBA also defines a wide range of services ( CORBAservices <ref> [6] </ref>) and facilities ( CORBAfacilities) to extend the core capabilities of the ORB. These services are important for the UPC system since they make many aspects of UPC easier to implement. Currently we only use CORBAservices in our UPC system.

Reference-contexts: Typically, this is achieved by physically ca r-rying a computing device such as a laptop or a PDA with appropriate Internet connectivity (via wireless or wired links) and mobility support such as mobile IP <ref> [7] </ref>. We envisage another form of nomadic computing on the Internet in which it is the users personal co m-puting environment that is mobile. A personal computing environment consists of the set of resources, ser vices, and personal preferences as configured by the user at his home network.

Reference-contexts: The CORBA services in particular help in dealing with object distribution, interfacing and integr ation. We consider UPC as an effort in realizing the ubiquitous computing <ref> [10] </ref> on Internet by making users computing environment available on any Internet-connected machines. The only requirement is that the m a-chines support Java and CORBA, which should be reasonable considering the widespread use of distributed object computing on the Internet.
