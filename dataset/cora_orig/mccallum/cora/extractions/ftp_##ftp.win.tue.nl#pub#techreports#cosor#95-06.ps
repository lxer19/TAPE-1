Reference-contexts: Finally, the inequality jcx 0 C y 0 j &gt; 1 has to be satisfied. These conditions together are easily seen to be sufficient. The following system shows an example of this: A :D 0 1 1 ; c :D <ref> [1; 0] </ref>; y 0 :D 1; U :D f0g: Here, x 0 :D 0 is the unique completely saturated initial state. fl Because of this lemma, we see that the observability problem is equivalent to a particular controllability problem: We have to find out what initial states can be controlled to <p> Hence the space of APF's is linear. In particular, any finite sum of periodic functions is an APF. This is the type of APF we are going to encounter. It is well known (see <ref> [1] </ref>) that an APF is bounded and uniformly continuous. We will need two more properties of APF's: LEMMA 6.1 Let f be an APF. <p> This implies the required result. 2. Take in the above decomposition, Nv D [v 0 1 ; 0] 0 , where v 1 :D <ref> [0; : : : ; 1] </ref> 0 , and apply the previous result. fl 9

For this, we refer to <ref> [2] </ref>, [3] (for the case without an offset). Let us now give a more specific description of the problems we are going to investigate.
