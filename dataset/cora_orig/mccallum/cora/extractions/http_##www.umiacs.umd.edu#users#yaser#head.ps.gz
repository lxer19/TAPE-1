Title: Recognition of Head Gestures Using Hidden Markov Models

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for the recognition of head gestures. A gesture corresponds to a particular pattern of head movement. The facial plane is tracked using a parameterized model and the temporal sequence of three image rotation parameters are used to describe four gestures. A dynamic vector quantization scheme was implemented to transform the parameters into suitable input data for the HMMs. Each model was trained by the iterative Baum-Welch procedure using 28 sequences taken from 5 persons. Experimental results from a different data set (33 new sequences from 6 other persons) demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

Reference-contexts: This planar model has proven to be a reasonable approximation of the face image motion under a wide range of head movements. The image motion of a rigid planar region of the scene can be described by the following model <ref> [1] </ref>: u (x; y) = a 0 + a 1 x + a 2 y + b 0 x 2 + b 1 xy where the a i and b j are parameters to be estimated and u (x; y) and v (x; y) are the horizontal and vertical components of

Reference-contexts: P3 The training problem: given and O, how to adjust the model parameters to maximize P [Oj]. Although there is no known way to analytically solve this problem, a model can be chosen such that P [Oj] is locally maximized using the iterative Baum-Welch method <ref> [2] </ref>. The first task is to build individual gesture models by using the solution of the training problem P3 to optimally estimate their parameters. Refinements of the model can be made by using the solution of P2, that helps us understand the meaning of the states of the model.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, isolating the roles of individual body-parts and their actions turns out to be a difficult task [5]. In this paper we focus on the recognition of a subset of head gestures. Automatic face segmentation, tracking and recognition of face expressions have recently been reported <ref> [3, 4, 10] </ref>.

We use the system developed by Black and Yacoob <ref> [3] </ref> to track the face and estimate its image motion parameters. The face is treated as a rigid body moving in 3D space, and its motion is characterized using 8 parameters. The parameters are coded by a vector quantization scheme to obtain a single data stream suitable for the HMMs. <p> The next section describes the implementation of our whole system. 3. System Implementation The block diagram of our head gesture recognition system is presented in Figure 1. We use the approach developed by Black and Yacoob <ref> [3] </ref> to track the motion of the face. A brief description of the relevant part of this system is given in Section 3.1. The rigid-motion of the face is characterized by 8 parameters. <p> The description of the head gestures used for the experimentation of the system and their models are given in Section 3.3. 3.1. Tracking the Face Rigid Motion The face tracking system developed by Black and Yacoob <ref> [3] </ref> is able to track face rigid and non-rigid motion based on some facial features. The face is treated as a rigid-body moving in 3D space and it is approximated by a plane viewed under perspective projection. <p> The image-curl in Figure 2 is a measure of rotation given by image-curl = a 4 a 2 . Other measures of facial motion and the tracking of some facial features are described in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.2. Vector Quantization Vector quantization [7] is used to code the parameters of interest into observation symbols that can be processed by the HMMs. The face tracking system provides streams for the eight motion parameters, from which the three image rotations are obtained.

Hidden Markov Models Hidden Markov Models are an extension of the theory of discrete Markov chains. Rabiner <ref> [8] </ref> presents a tutorial on HMMs with applications to speech recognition. The special case of a discrete, first order, Markov chain is completely described by a set of states, a set of state transition probabilities and the specification of the initial state. <p> This concept of Markov model can be extended to include the case where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, so that the state is not directly observable, i.e., hidden. Formally, an HMM is defined by the following <ref> [8] </ref>: 1. A set of states S = fs 1 ; s 2 ; :::; s N g of the model, where N is the number of states of the model.
