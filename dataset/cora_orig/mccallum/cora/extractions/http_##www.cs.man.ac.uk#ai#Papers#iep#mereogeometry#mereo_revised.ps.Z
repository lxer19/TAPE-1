Title: Ontologies for Plane, Polygonal Mereotopology  
Author: Ian Pratt Oliver Lemon 
Address: Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Manchester  
Abstract: Several authors have suggested that a more parsimonious and conceptually elegant treatment of everyday mereological and topological reasoning can be obtained by adopting a spatial ontology in which regions, not points, are the primitive entities. This paper challenges this suggestion for mereotopological reasoning in 2-dimensional space. Our strategy is to define a mereotopological language together with a familiar, point-based interpretation. It is proposed that, to be practically useful, any alternative region-based spatial ontology must support the same sentences in our language as this familiar interpretation. This proposal has the merit of transforming a vague, open-ended question about ontologies for "practical" mereotopological reasoning into a precise question in model theory. We show that (a version of) the familiar interpretation is countable and atomic, and therefore prime. We conclude that useful alternative ontologies of the plane are, if anything, less parsimonious than the one which they are supposed to replace.

Reference-contexts: Proof: It is straightforward to show that P j= OE [a] iff P j= OE [ b] by induction on the complexity of OE, and using lemma 4.9. 2 Lemma 5.2 Q R. Proof: According to the Tarski-Vaught lemma (Hodges <ref> [20] </ref> p. 55), if Q R and, for any n-tuple a of Q and any formula OE (x) of the form 9y (x; y) such that R j= OE [a], there exists b 2 Q such that R j= [a; b], then Q R. By construction, Q R. <p> But it is not immediately obvious that corresponding facts apply to T ; and that is what we must show. Once we have done this, the development parallels that of the polygonal case. The following result is well-known (see, e.g., Hodges <ref> [20] </ref> p. 92 for an explanation): Theorem 6.3 Any definable subset of IR is a finite union of points and open intervals (possibly unbounded); moreover, the endpoints of these intervals are all definable.

Reference-contexts: Various logicians have sought to give deductive theories of space and space-time (Basri [4], Carnap [7], Goldblatt [16], Henkin, Suppes and Tarski [19]), many in terms of modal logics (Balbiani et al. [3], Rescher and Garson [29], Rescher and Urquhart [30], Segerberg [32], Shehtman [34], von Wright <ref> [38] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: If regions are first class entities and points are logical constructions based on them, then who knows what interesting new ways of considering spatial entities and relations there might be? Clarke [11], [12], following an idea of Whitehead <ref> [39] </ref>, sought to reconstruct mereotopology in terms of a primitive relation of connection holding between regions. Following this work, Biacino and Gerla [5] have studied models of Clarke's theory.
