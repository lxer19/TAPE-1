Title: A Network-Conscious Approach to End-to-End Video Delivery over Wide Area Networks Using Proxy Servers  
Author: Yuewei Wang, Zhi-Li Zhang, David H.C. Du, and Dongli Su 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel network-conscious approach to the problem of end-to-end video delivery over wide-area networks using proxy servers situated between local-area networks (LANs) and a backbone wide-area network (WAN). We develop a novel and effective video delivery technique called video staging via intelligent utilization of the disk bandwidth and storage space available at proxy servers. We also design several video staging methods and evaluate their effectiveness in reducing the backbone WAN bandwidth requirement. Our results demonstrate that the proposed proxy-server-based, network-conscious approach provides an effective and scalable solution to the problem of the end-to-end video delivery over wide-area networks.

In formulating the problem of design multiple video staging scheme, we assume that the user access pattern at a LAN is characterized by a known Zipf distribution with skewness parameter ff.

Reference-contexts: The problem of end-to-end real-time transport of stored video over a network has been studied in many contexts. In particular, a number of researchers have considered using video smoothing techniques to reduce the variability in transmitting stored video from a server to a client across a high-speed network (see <ref> [2] </ref> and reference therein) by take advantage of the client buffer capabilities. These video smoothing techniques (implicitly) assume a homogeneous underlying network environment, and thus do not address the issue of heterogeneity in the underlying networking environment. <p> This ratio will be referred to as bandwidth reduction ratio. In this section, we present several video staging methods for a single video, and based on these methods, we study the effectiveness of video staging in reducing the backbone WAN bandwidth. We also integrate the optimal video smoothing technique <ref> [2] </ref> into the design of video staging methods to achieve further backbone WAN bandwidth reduction when clients have extra buffering capabilities available for smoothing. rate 2.1 Video Staging without Smoothing We first consider the case where clients have no extra buffering capabilities available for smoothing and describe a simple video staging <p> Let ~ D i denote the effective disk bandwidth consumed in this case. Then the bandwidth reduction ratio becomes R i = P i T i ~ D i 2.2 Video Staging with Smoothing If clients have extra buffering capabilities, the video smoothing (e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>) can be incorporated into the design of video staging methods to further reduce the backbone WAN bandwidth requirement. <p> We describe these two ap proaches below, and assume that he optimal video smoothing algorithm developed in <ref> [2] </ref> is used for video smoothing. 2.2.1 Cut-off After Smoothing Consider video i with N i frames and a sequence of frames with size s j i , j = 1; : : : ; N i .

Reference-contexts: In the next round, the buffers are swapped. The effective disk bandwidth depends on the block size used in disk retrieval. Based on the experimental study in <ref> [4] </ref>, we choose a block size of 200KB which yields an effective bandwidth of approximately 5MB/s.

Reference-contexts: Due to the page limitation, we do not present the formal formulation of this problem here. The readers may refer to <ref> [5] </ref> for the details of the problem formulation. The optimal solution to this problem is prohibitively complicated, if not impossible. As an alternative, we present two heuristic algorithms. <p> For the given CP i , the video with largest R i should be chosen, and CP i percentage of its video data as determined by the CAS method will be staged at the proxy server. The readers may refer to <ref> [5] </ref> for the details of LBRRF algorithm. 3.4 Empirical Evaluation In this section, we evaluate the performance of the two heuristic approaches, SHVO and LBRRF based on simulation. The disk system model is again based on the Sea-gate Elite-9 disk, the parameters of which is listed in Table 2.2.2.
