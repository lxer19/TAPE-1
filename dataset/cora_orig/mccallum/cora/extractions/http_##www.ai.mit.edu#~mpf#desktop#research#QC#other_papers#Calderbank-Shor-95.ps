Abstract: A quantum error-correcting code is defined to be a unitary mapping (encoding) of k qubits (2-state quantum systems) into a subspace of the quantum state space of n qubits such that if any t of the qubits undergo arbitrary decoherence, not necessarily independently, the resulting n qubits can be used to faithfully reconstruct the original quantum state of the k encoded qubits. Quantum error-correcting codes are shown to exist with asymptotic rate k=n = 1 2H 2 (2t=n) where H 2 (p) is the binary entropy function p log 2 p (1 p) log 2 (1 p). Upper bounds on this asymptotic rate are given. PACS numbers: 03.65.Bz, 89.70.+c

Reference-contexts: We have thus unitarily restored the original state and corrected t decohered bits. 2 As in Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>, we correct the error by measuring the decoherence without disturbing the encoded information. Intuitively, what we do is to measure the decoherence without observing the encoded state; this then lets us correct the decoherence while leaving the encoded state unchanged.

Reference-contexts: 1 H 2 (2t=3n); H 2 1 q i for t=n &lt; 1 2 .

These bounds are plotted in Fig. 1 in Section V. II. DEFINITIONS Our constructions of quantum error-correcting codes rely heavily on the properties of classical error-correcting codes. We will thus first briefly review certain definitions and properties related to binary linear error-correcting codes. <p> We will next use this observation to obtain an upper bound on the channel capacity of quantum channels. An upper bound for the amount of classical information carried by a quantum channel is given by the Levitin-Kholevo theorem <ref> [10] </ref>.

In this paper, we define fidelity slightly differently from the definition in Refs. [15]; we make this change as these previous papers discuss channels that transmit some distribution of quantum states given a priori, whereas we want our channel to faithfully transmit any pure input state. <p> Since quantum information can be used to carry classical information, the Levitin-Kholevo bound can be used to obtain an upper bound for the rate of a quantum error-correcting code. Consider the following quantum channel discussed in Ref. <ref> [11] </ref>; this channel treats each qubit independently. With probability 1 p, a qubit is unchanged, corresponding to the identity transformation 0 1 . <p> This bound is plotted in Fig. 1. For this channel, the bound is achievable for classical information, but we believe it is unlikely to be tight for quantum information. Another question that has been studied is: how much entanglement can be transmitted over a quantum channel <ref> [11] </ref>. Since any means of transmitting quantum states with high fidelity can also be used to transmit entanglement, upper bounds for entanglement transmission also apply to the quantum information capacity of a quantum channel. For the above channel, the upper bound proved in Ref. [11] is H 2 ( 1 2 <p> be transmitted over a quantum channel <ref> [11] </ref>. Since any means of transmitting quantum states with high fidelity can also be used to transmit entanglement, upper bounds for entanglement transmission also apply to the quantum information capacity of a quantum channel. For the above channel, the upper bound proved in Ref. [11] is H 2 ( 1 2 + p (1 p)) for p &lt; 1 2 . This bound is also plotted in Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: The codes C and C ? correspond to C 2 and C 1 , respectively, 11 in the Section III; we have now added the requirement that C ? 1 = C 2 . We follow MacWilliams et al. <ref> [13] </ref>. They call a code weakly self-dual if hh1 n ii C C ? : (20) Given a vector v with even weight we need that the number of k-dimensional weakly self-dual codes for which v 2 C ? is independent of v. <p> In other words, the number of k-dimensional weakly self-dual codes C contained in a given hyperplane v ? is independent of v. We apply Theorem 2.1 of Ref. <ref> [13] </ref> (actually a stronger statement established in the proof). Let n;k;s be the number of k-dimensional weakly self-dual codes C [n;k] that contain a given s-dimensional code C [n;s] . Then the numbers n;k;s are independent of the code C [n;s] that was chosen.

Reference-contexts: The probability distribution could also be concentrated entirely in the inital mixed state of H env , and a fixed unitary transform U be used <ref> [14] </ref>, but this leads to a slightly less intuitive description of the one quantum channel that we later discuss in detail.
