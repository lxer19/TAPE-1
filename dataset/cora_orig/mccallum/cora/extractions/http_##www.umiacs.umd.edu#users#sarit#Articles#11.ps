Abstract: Note: This paper appears in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Abstract The area of automated negotiation has been of particular interest in AI due to the important role negotiations play in facilitating understanding and the achievement of cooperation among entities with differing interests, whether they be individuals, organizations, governments, or automated agents. This paper presents a strategic model for negotiation of alternative offers, with specific application to international crises. In this model, both players can opt out, and while one loses over time, the other gains (up to a point). Specific issues are: conflicting objectives and utility functions of parties and the impact of time on bargaining behavior in crisis. The general model has relevance to the hostage crisis from which it was built, and subsequent applicability in building an automated negotiation agent for experimental and training purposes.

Reference-contexts: The research in planning and agent architectures of the last decade has been focused precisely on the transformation of single-agent, atemporal, static theories into multi-agent, temporal, dynamically capable ones. A community of researchers working on distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) has arisen (for a survey of DAI see <ref> [1, 15] </ref>). One of the most difficult subjects that has occupied the efforts of the DAI community has been the subject of negotiation [55, 19, 59, 41, 5, 9, 47, 51, 34, 64, 33, 11, 35, 61].

Reference-contexts: This is a direct outgrowth of the serious consideration currently being given to agents operating in challenging, real-world environments. For many years, highly restricted domains were considered sufficient for AI research purposes, and agents such as Shakey <ref> [12] </ref> could be designed and built for operation in simplified, restricted environments. The research on agent architectures and on planning typically made several standard assumptions, including the existence of a static domain, the lack of deadlines, and the existence of a single agent, i.e., our agent.

Rather, we think that after relaxation of the full information condition and taking into consideration the behavior of a third party, delays in reaching an early agreement will appear.

Reference-contexts: Rosenschein and Genesereth [47] used certain game-theoretic techniques to model communication and promises in multi-agent interaction. There, the process of negotiation was severely restricted; the agents could only make single, simultaneous offers. This work was extended by Zlotkin and Rosenschein in [63]. Using game theoretic results (mainly of Harsanyi <ref> [21] </ref>), they introduced a negotiation protocol for the case of agents who are able to share a discrete set of tasks with one another. <p> The formal game theory approach is also divided into two central sub-approaches concerning the bargaining problem (see <ref> [21] </ref>). The first is the strategic approach. The players' negotiating maneuvers are moves in a noncooperative game and the rationality assumption is expressed by investigation of the Nash Equilibrium. 1 The second approach is the axiomatic method.

Reference-contexts: Egypt and the terrorists negotiate a deal involving release of the hostages and safe passage for the terrorists 6. The terrorists give up. Each party to the negotiation has a set of objectives, and a certain number of utility points is associated with each (see <ref> [28] </ref>). Utility points were assigned in order to express a complex set of preferences in such a way that subtle distinctions can be made among them. <p> 1, then if I is the first player P ( ^ f ; ^g) = (^s P;0 ; 0). 4.6 Player I 's situation changes from winning to losing over time In the hostage crisis there is some point when the terrorists stop gaining and start losing over time (see <ref> [28] </ref>). We want to consider such models and to show that our results are still valid. Suppose there is some T c 2 such that from that period on player I stops gaining and starts losing over time. <p> Commitments are enforced. 5. Assumptions (1)-(4) are common knowledge. In our case S = f (0; 799); (1; 798); :::; (799; 0)g. Since we assume that an agreement between Israel and the terrorists requires that Israel release at least one prisoner <ref> [28] </ref>, an agreement (s 1 ; s 2 ) 2 S is interpreted as Israel releasing s 1 + 1 prisoners. Israel is a player of type P and the terrorists initiate the crisis (type I). We denote Israel by P Is and the terrorists by I T .

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we will use the stronger notion of (subgame) perfect equilibrium (P.E.) (see [53]) which requires that the players' strategies induce an equilibrium in any subgame (see <ref> [29] </ref> for the full definition). 4.3 Zone of Possible Agreement When analyzing the model, the main question is whether a possibility exists that the players will reach an agreement.

See <ref> [31] </ref> for an extension of the model to an n-player game. 11 Negotiation is an iterative process that may include several iterations and may even continue forever.

Reference-contexts: The hijackers will eventually demand the release from Israeli security prisons of an undetermined number of Arab prisoners, and safe passage for the hijackers to an as yet undisclosed destination (for additional details see <ref> [32] </ref>.) The hostage crisis was chosen as a typical case of multiparty negotiation. Although this hypothetical case is quite specific in details, the intention is to build a general model of negotiation. <p> This can be done by examining the factors that influence the outcomes in each of the cases. Do we think that in real situations and even in simulations of such situations an agreement 26 will be reached in the first or second periods? We suspect not (see <ref> [32, 20, 50] </ref>).

Unlike Snyder and Diesing, Leng's typology is based on the joint behavior of the crisis dyad.

Reference-contexts: Davis and Smith's work on the Contract Net [55] introduced a form of simple negotiation among cooperative agents, with one agent announcing the availability of tasks and awarding them to other bidding agents. Malone refined this technique considerably by overlaying it with a more sophisticated economic model <ref> [41] </ref>, proving optimality under certain conditions. While Davis and Smith's original work assumed some autonomy among agents, these agents willingly bid for tasks without explicit motivation.

Reference-contexts: Also, our model takes the passage of time during the negotiation process itself into consideration, 4 which in turn influences the outcome of the negotiations and avoids delays in reaching an agreement. Matwin et al. <ref> [42] </ref> developed an expert system shell called Negoplan to support single party participants in a negotiation. Negoplan simulates the changes in the positions of the parties during the negotiation, based on their anticipated behavior.

Reference-contexts: The first is informal theories which attempt to identify possible strategies for a negotiator and to assist a negotiator in achieving optimal results (see [13, 8, 22]). The other approach is the formal theory of bargaining originating with the work of John Nash ([43] <ref> [44] </ref>), who attempted to construct formal models of negotiation environments and to prove different theorems about the best strategies a negotiator can follow under different circumstances. This formal game theory approach provides clear analyses of various situations and precise results concerning the strategy a negotiator should choose.

Reference-contexts: Rubinstein [49] and Sta _ hl [57] developed models of alternating offers, which take time into consideration.

Reference-contexts: assumptions we will be forced to make in developing the general strategic model will not be applicable in some situations, and in such cases we intend to use the informal theorems, referred to above, in order to fill in the gaps (in this respect our approach is similar to Raiffa <ref> [46] </ref>). The formal game theory approach is also divided into two central sub-approaches concerning the bargaining problem (see [21]). The first is the strategic approach. <p> In particular, no agent regrets either making an offer that was rejected or rejecting an offer (see, for example, the discussion of "decision-regret" in <ref> [46] </ref>). In studying the Hostage Crisis case we identified a set of conditions that the players' preference relations should satisfy. We determined that those conditions fit a wide variety of cases.

Reference-contexts: Our work takes as a point of departure the work of researchers who have studied the negotiations that could take place among agents that serve the interests of truly distinct parties <ref> [59, 47, 63, 25, 30, 31] </ref>. The agents are autonomous; they have their own utility functions, and no global notion of utility plays a role in their design. The agents are individually motivated. <p> While she concentrated on the perspective of the mediator (see also [23]), we want to analyze such situations from the point of view of the autonomous agents that participate in the conflict, and to concentrate on the time constraints of the situations. Rosenschein and Genesereth <ref> [47] </ref> used certain game-theoretic techniques to model communication and promises in multi-agent interaction. There, the process of negotiation was severely restricted; the agents could only make single, simultaneous offers. This work was extended by Zlotkin and Rosenschein in [63].

Shaked and Sutton [54] extended these works by developing models in which a player can opt out of the game. <p> Any strategic model includes a detailed description of a bargaining procedure. Ours is a modification of Rubinstein's model of alternative offers which focuses on the passage of time and the preferences of the players for different agreements as well as for opting out of the negotiations <ref> [49] </ref>. The outcomes of the model will be defined as perfect equilibria which require that a player's strategy be optimal in each step of the game. Using these notions we will analyze different kinds of negotiation situations. <p> A3 Opting Out Over Time: If t 1 &lt; t 2 (O; t 1 ) P (O; t 2 ) and (O; t 2 ) I (O; t 1 ). 4 Previous work on models of alternating offers (see, for example <ref> [49] </ref>, [54]) assumed that time is of value to all parties. The Hostage Crisis is a situation in which one side (the terrorists) gains over time, while the other side (Israel) loses over time.

Reference-contexts: This can be done by examining the factors that influence the outcomes in each of the cases. Do we think that in real situations and even in simulations of such situations an agreement 26 will be reached in the first or second periods? We suspect not (see <ref> [32, 20, 50] </ref>). Rather, we think that after relaxation of the full information condition and taking into consideration the behavior of a third party, delays in reaching an early agreement will appear.

Reference-contexts: However, the use of Nash Equilibrium is not an effective way of analyzing the outcomes of the models of alternating offers since it puts few restrictions on the outcome ([49]). Therefore, we will use the stronger notion of (subgame) perfect equilibrium (P.E.) (see <ref> [53] </ref>) which requires that the players' strategies induce an equilibrium in any subgame (see [29] for the full definition). 4.3 Zone of Possible Agreement When analyzing the model, the main question is whether a possibility exists that the players will reach an agreement.

This is the result of our assumption that the utility function of opting out changes differently over time than the utility function of an agreement. Therefore, we need the following definition in order to compare agreements with opting out.

Reference-contexts: The analysis of negotiation and bargaining behavior in crisis situations has fallen predominantly in the domain of political science. Studies in this area include a focus on deterrence [18], the bargaining process itself <ref> [56] </ref>, cross national models of crisis decision making [2, 58], cognitive closure and crisis management [36], quantitative analysis of bargaining [38] and studies of crisis prevention [17]. <p> Our approach in the development of a model of strategic negotiation has been guided most directly by two studies. According to Snyder and Diesing <ref> [56] </ref>, the three types of bargaining in crisis are accommodative, coercive, and persuasive. In the accommodative approach, we note a convergence of the bargaining positions of the parties toward a settlement through a sequence of bids or proposals for settlement, involving demands, offers, and concessions.
