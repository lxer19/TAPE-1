Reference-contexts: to proceed seamlessly; input from both users can be used to place the injectors in optimal positions, rather than requiring one user to remotely direct another in the proper placement of injectors. 4 Performance Results The interactive analysis tool described in the preceding section was demonstrated at Supercomputing '95 (SC'95) <ref> (Diachin et al., 1995) </ref> on an experimental, high-performance computing and network platform called the Information Wide Area Year (I-WAY) (Korab and Brown, 1995). The I-WAY was built by linking supercomputing resources and advanced visualization devices around the country with a high-bandwidth Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network.

Reference-contexts: The calculation is separate from the visualization process. The communication layer used to transfer information between the two software components is the CAVEcomm message-passing library developed at Argonne National Laboratory <ref> (Disz et al., 1995) </ref>. For a specific commercial boiler installation, this design paradigm can be used to obtain an initial injector configuration.

Reference-contexts: Both the simulation code and the graphics code use the MPI clock MPI Wtime () <ref> (Gropp et al., 1994) </ref> to record elapsed wall clock time in seconds for these two components. As expected, the calculations for the array of three hundred streamlines are the most computationally expensive, requiring 22 seconds on the Onyx and 35 seconds on the SP.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the particle tracking model used to model the sprays from the injectors can be improved in several ways. For instance, we can increase the resolution and hence the numerical accuracy around the nozzle by incorporating unstructured mesh techniques such as those developed in the SUMAA3d <ref> (Jones and Plassmann, 1994) </ref> project. We can also improve the statistical accuracy of the model by using parallel processing to increase the number of droplet trajectories sampled and by incorporating a more realistic droplet evaporation model.

Reference-contexts: An additional critical technology is the network infrastructure necessary to support the high-bandwidth communication between remote collaborators; a prototype of such a network was demonstrated as part of the Information Wide Area Year (I-WAY) <ref> (Korab and Brown, 1995) </ref> at the Supercomputing '95 (SC'95) conference. In this paper, we describe the development of a real-time, interactive simulation and analysis environment used in the design of pollution control systems for commercial boilers and incinerators. <p> requiring one user to remotely direct another in the proper placement of injectors. 4 Performance Results The interactive analysis tool described in the preceding section was demonstrated at Supercomputing '95 (SC'95) (Diachin et al., 1995) on an experimental, high-performance computing and network platform called the Information Wide Area Year (I-WAY) <ref> (Korab and Brown, 1995) </ref>. The I-WAY was built by linking supercomputing resources and advanced visualization devices around the country with a high-bandwidth Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network. This platform represented an ideal testbed for examining the performance of the interactive and collaborative components of the virtual boiler over long distances.

Reference-contexts: Currently, the commercial CFD code PHOENICS (PHOENICS Reference Manual, 1991) is used to compute the steady-state combustion solutions. The fluid flow solutions and temperature distributions obtained from the solution of the CFD models are used as the input for modeling the chemical reactions involving the injector systems <ref> (Patankar, 1980) </ref>. The results of the chemical kinetics model for each injector configuration give the predicted effectiveness of the pollution control system. Finding the optimal configuration of the injection system is an iterative process in which the only parameters that can be adjusted are nozzle location and specific spray configuration.
