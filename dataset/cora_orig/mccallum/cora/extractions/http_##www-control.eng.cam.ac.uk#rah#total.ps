Reference-contexts: The theory of optimal control originated with Zames in 1981 [Zam81]. The solution techniques at the time only effectively addressed the SISO case as the frequency domain solution methods ran into technical problems for the multivariable case. The later state-space solution (see for example Francis <ref> [Fra87] </ref>) were able to address the multivariable case, but resulted in controllers of high state dimension. The most recent solution to the standard problem is that of [DGKF89], [GD88], and is referred to as the DGKF solution.

Reference-contexts: Freudenberg shows in <ref> [Fre89] </ref> that robust performance is synonymous to tolerating simultaneous uncertainty at different points in the loop. Figure 4.6 illustrates simultaneous uncertainty at two different points in the loop. A solution to the problem of maximising robustness to simultaneous and can be found using the structured singular value.

Reference-contexts: Some justification of the weights selection procedure is given, and it is shown how the procedure is easily configured to meet the aircraft handling quality requirements given in chapter 3. The procedure is also discussed in the light of recent work by Freudenberg <ref> [Fre90] </ref> on loop-shaping. Finally some design examples are presented, including hover and fully wing-borne flight examples for the GVAM, and also a design on a fractional distillation column which is used as an example of poorly conditioned plants. <p> For both of these examples the plant is well conditioned at the desired bandwidth. To illustrate the procedure applied to a poorly conditioned plant, an example design on a fractional distillation column is given in 4.8. Freudenberg <ref> [Fre90] </ref> has examined the problem of multivariable loop-shaping for ill-conditioned plants. His approach is to examine the dependence of closed-loop properties at one point in the loop on the open-loop singular values at another. <p> When applying the procedure to ill-conditioned plants, the fact that the loop weights chosen are round reflects the plant directionality, and produces realistic designs given the plant's inherent limitations. This approach is consistent with Freudenberg's conclusions in <ref> [Fre90] </ref>. In the next section his results are reviewed, and then related to the loop-shaping procedure given here. <p> This approach is consistent with Freudenberg's conclusions in [Fre90]. In the next section his results are reviewed, and then related to the loop-shaping procedure given here. The desirability of round controllers and plants is easily seen from <ref> [Fre90, Proposition 4.1] </ref> : = 0 = 0 (1 [ ]) [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] (4.5) If ( ) = 1, then [ ] = [ ]. Hence a rounded compensator ensures similar levels of disturbance rejection at the plant input and output.

Reference-contexts: Hence ( ) is a measure of the smallest structured that causes instability. Notice that the maximum singular value of is an overbound in ( ), and as such is conservative. Comprehensive software is now available which solves for general complex or mixed complex and non-repeated real blocks <ref> [FTD91] </ref>. Structured singular value analysis is made use of in chapter 6 for analysis of scheduled systems. Approximate synthesis is also possible with the structured singular value using the so-called DK-iteration. <p> The real structured singular value in this case is given by ( ) = max : is a real eigenvalue of (see <ref> [FTD91] </ref>), and so can be calculated exactly. However, this does not allow for uncertainty in the LFT model of the plant, nor does it check performance. To address both of these points an extra complex block can be added to represent the /loop-shaping cost function.

Reference-contexts: It has a divergent response in roll which means the pilot must ensure that he doesn't put on too much bank angle. In yaw there is very low directional stability, and high yaw rates at low speeds are potentially lethal <ref> [Gai90] </ref> 2. Inceptor configuration. The pilot has to operate both the nozzle lever and throttle setting with his left hand, leaving the right hand free to control the aircraft in pitch and roll using the stick. <p> During a typical descent the pilot has to step the nozzle lever through 20, 40, 65 and finally 80 degrees with appropriate increases in the throttle setting <ref> [Gai90] </ref>. 3. Poor decoupling. The pilot's inceptors do not command directly what the pilot wishes to control; for example, a change in nozzle lever setting alters both vertical and horizontal accelerations. Automatic control has great potential for addressing all three of these undesirable characteristics.

Reference-contexts: The later state-space solution (see for example Francis [Fra87]) were able to address the multivariable case, but resulted in controllers of high state dimension. The most recent solution to the standard problem is that of [DGKF89], <ref> [GD88] </ref>, and is referred to as the DGKF solution. This approach involves solving only two Riccati equations, and results in a controller of state dimension no higher than that of the weighted plant. This is the solution method used for the designs in this thesis. <p> As the emphasis of this thesis is that of the practicalities of applying control to a realistic design example, the controller equations are not presented here. For these the reader is referred to <ref> [GD88] </ref>. Consider Figure 2.5. The design goal is to find which achieves the infinum of inf stabilising ( + ) The formulation is referred to as the " and " approach where = ( + ) is called the sensitivity. <p> Often and other optimal control design techniques are labelled as producing unnecessarily complex control laws. Considerable improvements have been made since the first solution methods for appeared, the state space solution methods of Glover and Doyle <ref> [GD88] </ref> now producing controllers of order no higher than that of the weighted plant. Model reduction techniques can also be applied to the initial plant model or the final controller. However, it is not just the order of the controller which is important.

Reference-contexts: Linear controller designs can then be evaluated on the GVAM using the TSIM package. Following this it is possible to evaluate them in real-time using the RAE piloted simulation facilities at Bedford. Design studies have been carried out by British Aerospace on full-authority fly-by-wire control systems <ref> [Gib90] </ref>. Full authority means that the control surfaces are affected only by the controller, as opposed to a limited authority where pilot controls still have direct mechanical links to the control surfaces. <p> Studies have been carried out on the Tornado, a variable stability Jaguar and on the Experimental Aircraft Programme (EAP) <ref> [Gib90] </ref>. These were all for single loop pitch control and hence did not achieve the degree of decoupling that could be achieved using multivariable x x x CHAPTER 3. <p> A MULTIVARIABLE DESIGN CASE STUDY 3.2 The Generic VSTOL Aircraft Model (GVAM) 3.3 Review of fly-by-wire and GVAM design studies 16 control. A key conclusion of these studies (summarised in <ref> [Gib90] </ref>) was that separating the design task into the two steps of 1. robust closed-loop stabilisation, and 2. command feedforward design, is a very effective design approach which easily arrives at good handling qualities combined with good stability margins. <p> A MULTIVARIABLE DESIGN CASE STUDY 2 2 sp sp o Dropback Delay, Degrees T . . . . . . Time (s) An outline of the British Aerospace/Gibson criteria appeared in <ref> [Gib90] </ref>. Although comprehensive numerical values for the proposed indices for evaluating handling qualities are not given, useful insights into designs presented in this thesis can still be found. <p> The controller is arrived at from frequency domain robustness considerations, and may well have modes which would give rise to a poor response if directly excited with references; by placing in the feedback path this problem is avoided. Note that the comment in <ref> [Gib90] </ref> that should have a direct term to make the response time to pilot demands consistent with the manually flown aircraft is complied with here. <p> For example, if the objective is getting from A to B via some flight path, flight path angle ( ) would be an appropriate variable to control, whereas in combat pointing becomes more important, and a -demand system would be more appropriate <ref> [Gib90] </ref>. Another driving force for different modes arises from the change in the aircraft's performance capabilities across the flight envelope.

Reference-contexts: It is possible that not all parameters in the controller will require scheduling, and that some may be fixed. This possibility was investigated using the gap metric. A definition of the gap metric and its relationship to normalised coprime factors can be found in Georgiou and Smith <ref> [GS90] </ref>. The effect on the gap between nominal and perturbed controller as each entry in the state space matrices of the controller is varied can be recorded.

Reference-contexts: However, it would be possible to update the controller parameters every other cycle, and thus reduce the amount of interpolation carried out. There is also clearly potential for parallel processing. Comparison of the number of parameters which must be stored is a little harder. It was shown in <ref> [HG91] </ref> that for a comparable upper limit on the achieved coprime factor robustness measure across the flight envelope, the two approaches require approximately the same number of parameters when appled to the GVAM.

Reference-contexts: The observer structure is used because of the necessity of having a fixed physical structure from one controller design to the next. This motivated a design study using the Multi Objective Programming System (MOPS) at Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fur Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR) <ref> [HJ91] </ref>. MOPS enables the controller structure to be fixed, and its parameters optimised. The results of this study are given in 8.4, and they give some useful insights into the GVAM designs and the trade-off between complexity and performance. <p> The performance objectives are carefully formulated to be smooth so that optimisation routines can be applied. The MOPS was applied to the 0 | 140 knots part of the GVAM flight envelope <ref> [HJ91] </ref> at DLR. Linearisations of the GVAM at 6, 86, 122 and 140 knots with the same inputs and outputs as for the 6 knot example in chapter 4 were used.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter the idea of switching between linear controller designs as a form of scheduling is motivated. The approach of Hanus <ref> [HKH87] </ref> is used to effect bumpless transfer between controllers on the GVAM. A rudimentary stability test is presented which indicates potential switching instabilities. This chapter shows how controllers from the loop-shaping procedure may be truly gain scheduled with flight condition. <p> There is also the possibility that the initial state could affect the system such that the key parameter changes so as to take the system back to the previous controller, and thereby possibly initiate an instability. One approach to this state initialisation problem has been suggested by Hanus <ref> [HKH87] </ref>, and effects so-called "bumpless transfer" between controllers. The term "bumpless" is used because no discontinuity appears directly at the plant input with this approach. The approach is described in 5.2, and its merits and limitations discussed. <p> at the pilot's station, and degrees per second roll." 5.1 Introduction An Implementation Methodology Using Switching Chapter 5 1 1 1 r K h K r r K m K h K K K K K K m 1 52 controller Next scheduled Plant Controller Current The Hanus technique in <ref> [HKH87] </ref> achieves smooth transition between controllers by ensuring that the states of the next controller to be switched in are always consistent with current plant states. <p> The motivation for the second assumption is lost by simply disconnecting the anti-windup compensator when the system comes out of saturation. This would then allow fl to be dynamic. The Hanus approach <ref> [HKH87] </ref> for switching between controllers as described in chapter 5 is equally applicable to controller anti-windup in the event of actuator saturation.

Reference-contexts: CHAPTER 3. A MULTIVARIABLE DESIGN CASE STUDY 17 There have been several design studies on the GVAM to evaluate the suitability of various control design techniques. Hopper <ref> [Hop90] </ref> used a so-called high gain method to design multivariable P+I controllers. The designs suffered from poor robust stability and poor robust performance, particular problems being encountered with the engine non-linearities. The approach was also not very good at accounting for actuator dynamics. <p> This is because the linear controllers must all have the same structure in order that gains may be interpolated. Conventional P+I controllers obviously have a clearly defined structure, and gain scheduling multivariable P+I controllers is also very straightforward - see for example <ref> [Hop90] </ref>. LQG controllers have been scheduled using the inherent plant observer structure of such controllers see for example [Kap84]. controllers in general do not have such an explicit structure, and scheduling presents a problem. <p> The engine had a tendency to perform a small amplitude limit cycle if the aircraft was flown on the knee of the engine non-linearity. The severity of this limit cycle was less than for previous studies on the GVAM [Smi90], <ref> [Hop90] </ref>, but clearly some action needed to be taken. This led to the engine control strategy described in chapter 3. 2. For saturated actuators the Hanus prevented wind-up well, but it didn't give the designer the ability to assign priorities to the controlled outputs during saturation.

Reference-contexts: This is essentially the same as running the controller backwards on the saturated plant inputs. The same limitations on the controller in terms of invertibility as were discussed in 5.2.3 apply. A design study on the GVAM <ref> [Hyd88] </ref> showed that this scheme works well for single actuator saturations. However, it was found that if more than one actuator saturates, then decoupling can degrade significantly. <p> The variable loop-gain approach to be described here was developed as a result of the deficiencies of the Hanus approach experienced when applying it to the GVAM <ref> [Hyd88] </ref>. Independently the scheme was also proposed in [KAS88]. The structure of the scheme is shown in Figure 7.5. Under normal operation = 1 0.
