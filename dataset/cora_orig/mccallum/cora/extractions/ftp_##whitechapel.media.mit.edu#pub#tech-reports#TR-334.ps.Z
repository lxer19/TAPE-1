Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 334 Submitted : International Symposium on Computer Vision 1995 Abstract We describe a novel approach for matching and recognition, based on deformable intensity surfaces. In this approach, the intensity surface of the image is modeled as a deformable thin plate, and its strain energy while deforming to a new image is measured for recognition. Each surface point has 3 degrees of freedom, thus capturing fine surface changes. The method is validated for recognition and interactive search in a large-scale face database.

Reference-contexts: The mathematical approach to our model is inspired by the one described in [18]. The intensity surface is modeled as a deformable mesh of size N fi N 0 nodes (figure 3). It is ruled by Lagrangian dynamics <ref> [1] </ref> : M U + C _ U + KU = F (t) (3) where U is a vector storing nodal displacements M, C and K are respectively the mass, damping and stiffness matrices of the system, and F is the image force. <p> Solving the governing equations in the modal basis leads to scalar equations where the unknown ~u (i) is the amplitude of mode i <ref> [1] </ref> : ~u (i) + ~c i _ ~u (i) + !(i) 2 ~u (i) = ~ f i (t) (6) c d g h Warping two different faces. c. d. Warping smiling face to neutral face. e. f. <p> expressions avoid the call to costly eigenvector-extraction routines ; moreover, they allow the total number of modes P fi P 0 to be easily adjusted. 4.2 Strain energy as a similarity measure The strain energy describing the amount of energy needed to deform a surface into another is by definition <ref> [1, 23] </ref> : E strain = 1 U T KU This expression is much simpler when developed in the modal (or vibration) basis of the system : E strain = 1 N X N 0 p 0 =1 Therefore, the low-order strain energy corresponding to P fi P 0 low-order modes <p> Basically, the optimal number of modes will be as small as possible, but should capture a representative sketch of the surface deformation. A typical a priori value covering many types of standard deformations is the quarter of the degrees of freedom in the system <ref> [1] </ref>. Therefore we set : P = N=4 and P 0 = N 0 =4 Note that these values correspond to a compression factor equal to 16. Consider now the deformation occuring in figure 4 (a and b).

The above models usually evolve in Euclidean 3D space, however, deformable templates which evolve in XY I space with application to feature extraction have been investigated by Yuille et al [29]. Hence, deformable intensity surfaces is a new approach to matching and recognition.

Reference-contexts: This essential observation is the basis of all shape from shading methods <ref> [8] </ref> ; however, unlike those methods, our aim is not actually to reconstruct depth information from a single 2D projection, but rather keep in mind that, under controlled lighting conditions, the changes in the image intensities from one image to the other reflect changes in their actual 3D shape.

Reference-contexts: the closest point P i in the 3D binary image discussed in section 2.2 : F (t) = [: : :; M i P i (t); : : :] T (4) Euclidean distance algorithms can help us extract this force in each voxel of the 3D image, as a pre-processing <ref> [7, 28] </ref>. Note that our formulation provides an interesting alternative to optical flow methods, without the classical brightness constraint [9].

Reference-contexts: The above models usually evolve in Euclidean 3D space, however, deformable templates which evolve in XY I space with application to feature extraction have been investigated by Yuille et al <ref> [29] </ref>. Hence, deformable intensity surfaces is a new approach to matching and recognition. The mathematical approach to our model is inspired by the one described in [18]. The intensity surface is modeled as a deformable mesh of size N fi N 0 nodes (figure 3).
