Abstract: This paper presents an advanced telerobotic control system for a mobile robot with multisensor feedback. A telecontrol concept for various degrees of cooperation between a human operator and a mobile robot is described. With multisensor on-board the robot at the remote site can adjust its path while continuously accepting commands from the human operator. Interactive modelling that allows the modelling of an unknown environment and makes landmarks known to the robot is introduced. A graphical user interface and a 3-D animation system are important elements in the teleoperation, they are integrated in this system to help the operator by task analysis, offline teaching and on-line monitoring. Experiments performed with the mobile robot PRIAMOS are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Many researches applied this technique in outer space (Kim, 1993; Hirzinger, 1993) or nuclear power plants. However most of the papers investigate a telemanipulator whose base is fixed in space and remotely controlled by an operator to repair or replace some machine units <ref> (Backes et al., 1991) </ref>. Only few papers discuss the teleoperation of mobile robots. (Chatila et al., 1991) discusses a remotely controlled "intervention robot", which accepts task commands from the ground operator and moves autonomously on the Mars. The operator acts mainly as a mission planner and supervisor.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents an advanced telerobotics system for mobile robots with multisensor feedback that considers different degrees of cooperation between an operator and a mobile robot, in order to achieve the best integration from both sides. As experimental testbed the mobile robot PRIAMOS <ref> (Dillmann et al., 1993) </ref>, which is equipped with different type sensors, is employed. The mobile robot control environment MARS 1 allows to test task analysis of the telerobotic concept including simulation of multiple mobile robots and is used for on-line monitoring.

Reference-contexts: Only few papers discuss the teleoperation of mobile robots. (Chatila et al., 1991) discusses a remotely controlled "intervention robot", which accepts task commands from the ground operator and moves autonomously on the Mars. The operator acts mainly as a mission planner and supervisor. In <ref> (Fournier et al., 1988) </ref> a computer aided teleoperation that uses a master/slave approach to bilaterally control a remote mobile robot is described. Integration of a supervising human operator and different sensor systems on-board opens a broad field of applications that can not be achieved by a fully autonomous system.

Reference-contexts: With this task editor the operator can also define a sequence of actions as a macro. These macros can be retrieved later to constitute a complete task plan. The concept of "Telesensorprogramming" <ref> (Hirzinger, 1993) </ref> is applied in the task analysis. Due to the errors in the dead-reckoning and world models, the sensor patterns must be used by the robot to assure an accurate relation to the world. Thus in the supervisory control mode an operator specifies a gross movement.

Reference-contexts: Despite being used in classical application areas of teleoperated systems, the system described provides a tool for programming the robot through demonstration. Such a way of programming is especially of interest for systems that will be operating in non-industrial environments under supervision of unexperienced users <ref> (Kaiser et al., 1994) </ref>. 2. THE MOBILE SYSTEM PRI AMOS PRIAMOS (Fig. 1) is a holonomous mobile system with three degrees of freedom, i.e., motion in longitudinal and transversal direction and rotation around the center of the vehicle.

Reference-contexts: The large and variable time-delays also make a kinesthetic feedback useless. Because the force the operator feels is averagely 0.8 sec later, he could not stably operate the remote robot <ref> (Paul and Funda, 1991) </ref>. with sensor feedback in a 3-D animation system 7.2 Shared Control of a Mobile Robot It is usual that a mobile robot moves around a building with rooms and walls. The operator has to guide the robot along the wall to monitor/explore the environment.

In a man-made environment a human can directly recognize the intersection of a wall and the floor. On a flat floor the z-coordinate of this intersection is known through the calibration and the camera position on the robot.
