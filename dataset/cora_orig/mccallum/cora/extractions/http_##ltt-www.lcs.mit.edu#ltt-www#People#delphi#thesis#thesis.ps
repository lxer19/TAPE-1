Freed. </author> <title> MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies. </title> <institution> RFC5121, Bellcore, </institution> <month> September </month> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: In this model, a digital document is data in arbitrary format accompanied by meta-information, which is part of a document, but not necessarily contained in the document itself. In order to easily transfer digital documents, I am creating a set of MIME <ref> [1] </ref> types, which describe the format of a document and contain the meta-information, while still allowing arbitrary data formats. What exactly do we mean by a document? A document can be a book. It can be a magazine or periodical. It can be a bibliography of a technical field. <p> The current standard for Internet email, which is defined by RFC822 [5], does not make provisions for 8-bit data, lines longer than 79 characters, or multiple objects within a single message. The MIME format, which is defined in RFC1521 <ref> [1] </ref> and RFC1522, was designed to circumvent these limitations.

Reference-contexts: replace the delivery of paper documents with electronic versions, instead of 16 using any expanded notion of what documents are. 2.2.1 GEDI The Group on Electronic Document Interchange is a consortium of 7 libraries and other parties who have defined a standard for electronic document interchange, called the GEDI Recommendations <ref> [2] </ref>. The goal of this group was to create a standard way to distribute electronic documents between participants. Most of their work went towards defining standard delivery protocols and mechanisms, as well as choosing a standard representation for the document.

Reference-contexts: The digiment format also uses the MIME multipart mechanism to embed many different types of data within a single digiment object. Finally, by using the MIME ID label, the individual data parts within the digiment can refer to each other. 2.5 OpenDoc and OLE OpenDoc [9] and OLE <ref> [3] </ref> are both relatively recent systems that are aimed at defining compound documents at the system level. These systems allow the creation of documents that can contain multiple data parts of any type. Data parts can even be programs themselves.

Reference-contexts: This can include the authors, the title, date of publication, number of pages, the abstract, copyright notices, and other types of information about the document. The information is stored in the standard bibliographic format used by the CSTR project, which is defined by RFC1357 <ref> [4] </ref>. The bibliography type allows a digiment browser to extract this information easily from the digiment. The information can then be used to help display the digiment.

Reference-contexts: Because this system was designed only to view scanned images, it was not designed to be extensible to arbitrary data formats. 2.3.3 Lectern Lectern is a document browser that is being developed as part of the Virtual Paper project at DEC Systems Research Center <ref> [7] </ref>. The primary goal of this project is to make a document browser that is good enough that people prefer to use it rather than paper documents.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it was not designed to create a definition for a digital document, but simply to designate common protocols to transmit some version of a document from one party to another. 2.2.2 TULIP The TULIP (The University LIcensing Project) is joint project between Elsevier Science Publishing Group and several Universities <ref> [8] </ref>. TULIP supplements paper subscriptions to journals with electronic versions of the journals. The TULIP project again is not attempting to create a new digital document system, but to create an electronic version of existing publications, specifically research journals.

Reference-contexts: form of a digital document that can contain any type of data, including proprietary formats that have been optimized for some property, as well as other types such as video or audio. 2.3.1 System 33 System 33 is a system developed at Xerox PARC designed to provide electronic document services <ref> [10] </ref>. Of all the systems surveyed, System 33 seemed to incorporate more of the concepts that were used in the digiment format than any other system.

Reference-contexts: The natural convergence of these two trends is for interactive, real time delivery of electronic documents from digital libraries. With a fast CPU, cheap memory and a good display, it will be possible to browse documents on-line from a variety of sources <ref> [11] </ref>.
