Abstract: This paper presents a trainable object detection architecture that is applied to detecting people in static images of cluttered scenes. This problem poses several challenges. People are highly non-rigid objects with a high degree of variability in size, shape, color, and texture. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or on motion. The detection technique is based on the novel idea of the wavelet template that defines the shape of an object in terms of a subset of the wavelet coefficients of the image. It is invariant to changes in color and texture and can be used to robustly define a rich and complex class of objects such as people. We show how the invariant properties and computational efficiency of the wavelet template make it an effective tool for object detection.

Reference-contexts: template In this section, we review the Haar wavelet, describe a denser (redundant) transform, and define the wavelet template. 2.1 The Haar dictionary In this section, for lack of space, we survey the properties of wavelets which are used in the paper; a more detailed treatment can be found in <ref> [7] </ref> and other standards references on wavelets. As motivated by the work on the template ratio, we were looking for an image representation which captures the relationship between average intensities of neighboring regions.

Reference-contexts: They model face and non-face patterns in a high dimensional space and derive a statistical model for the class of frontal human faces. Similar face detection systems have been developed by others (Vaillant, et al.[17], Rowley, et al.[11], Moghaddam and A. Pentland <ref> [8] </ref>, Osuna et al.[3]). Frontal human faces, despite their variability, share very similar patterns (shape and the spatial layout of facial features) and their color space is very constrained. This is not the case with pedestrians. Figure 1 shows several typical images of people in our database.

Reference-contexts: Another interesting aspect of the SVM is that its decision surface depends only on the inner product of the feature vectors. This leads to an important extension since we can replace the Euclidean inner product by any symmetric positive-definite kernel K (x; y) <ref> [9] </ref>. This use of a kernel is equivalent to mapping the feature vectors to a high-dimensional space, thereby significantly increasing the discriminative power of the classifier. For our classification problem, we find that using a polynomial of degree two as the kernel provides good results.

Reference-contexts: The detection problem is also complicated by the absence of constraints on the image background. Given these problems, direct analysis of pixel characteristics (e.g. intensity, color and texture) is not adequate. This paper presents a new approach motivated by an earlier piece of work by one of the authors <ref> [12] </ref> [13] who derived a new invariant called the 'ratio template' and applied it to face detection. A ratio template encodes the ordinal structure of the brightness distribution on a face. It consists of a set of inequality relationships between the average intensities of a few different face-regions. <p> For every novel window, the wavelet coefficients are compared to the pedestrian template. The matching value is the ratio of the coefficients in agreement. A similar approach was used in <ref> [12] </ref> for face detection with good results. <p> In summary, in our approach a pedestrian template is learned from examples and then used for classification, ideally in a template matching scheme. It is important to realize that this is not the only interpretation of our approach, though it is the one originally suggested by <ref> [12] </ref> and is the one emphasized throughout the paper. An alternative, and more general, point of view considers the step of learning the template as a dimensionality reduction stage.
