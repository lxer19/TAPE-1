Title: Estimating the Absolute Position of a Mobile Robot Using Position Probability Grids  
Author: Wolfram Burgard Dieter Fox Daniel Hennig Timo Schmidt 
Date: February 5, 1996  
Abstract: In order to re-use existing models of the environment mobile robots must be able to estimate their position and orientation in such models. Most of the existing methods for position estimation are based on special purpose sensors or aim at tracking the robot's position relative to the known starting point. This paper describes the position probability grid approach to estimating the robot's absolute position and orientation in a metric model of the environment. Our method is designed to work with standard sensors and is independent of any knowledge about the starting point. It is a Bayesian approach based on certainty grids. In each cell of such a grid we store the probability that this cell refers to the current position of the robot. These probabilities are obtained by integrating the likelihoods of sensor readings over time. Results described in this paper show that our technique is able to reliably estimate the position of a robot in complex environments. Our approach has proven to be robust with respect to inaccurate environmental models, noisy sensors, and ambiguous situations.

Reference-contexts: Finally, Section 5 describes experiments with this application in typical office environments. 2 Related work Various techniques for the estimation of the position of mobile vehicles by matching sensor readings against a given model of the environment have been developed in the past (see <ref> [4, 5] </ref> for overviews). Most of them address the problem of tracking the current position and orientation of the robot given its initial configuration.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the ability of estimating their position is one of the basic preconditions for the autonomy of mobile robots. The methods for position estimation can be roughly divided into two classes: relative and absolute position estimation techniques <ref> [5] </ref>. Members of the first class track the robot's relative position according to a known starting point. The problem solved by these methods is the correction of accumulated dead reckoning errors coming from the inherent inaccuracy of the wheel encoders and other factors such as slipping. <p> Finally, Section 5 describes experiments with this application in typical office environments. 2 Related work Various techniques for the estimation of the position of mobile vehicles by matching sensor readings against a given model of the environment have been developed in the past (see <ref> [4, 5] </ref> for overviews).

Reference-contexts: Simmons and Koenig [15] describe a similar approach to position estimation. They additionally utilize metric information coming from the wheel encoders to compute state transition probabilities. This metric information puts additional constraints on the robots location and results in more reliable position estimates.

Reference-contexts: The local map is matched against the global map to produce a position and orientation estimate. This estimate is combined with the previous estimate using a Kalman filter <ref> [7] </ref>, where the uncertainty is represented by the width of the Gaussian distribution. Compared to the approach of Wei et al., this technique allows an integration of different measurements over time rather than taking the optimum match of the most recent sensing as a guess for the current position.

We consider a discretization R 1 ; : : : ; R k of possible distances measured by the sensor. Consequently, p (R i jx ^ m) is the likelihood that a the distance R i is measured at the position x in m. <p> competition arena. 5.1 Implementation aspects For the sake of efficiency we implemented a simplified model of sonar sensors to compute the likelihood of a reading given a position x: Instead of considering all cells of the grid 9 covered by the sonar wedge (as described by Elfes and Moravec in <ref> [8] </ref>) we only consider the cells on the acoustic axis of the sensor. This rough simplification has already been applied successfully by Borenstein to realize a fast collision avoidance technique for mobile robots [2]. <p> Additionally, in orthogonal environments the reduction of possible orientations to the alignment of the walls drastically reduces the complexity of the overall problem. Furthermore the application of a map resolution hierarchy as proposed by Moravec in <ref> [8] </ref> can be used to produce rough position estimates which are refined subsequently. Despite these encouraging results there are several warrants for future research. This concerns optimizations as described above as well as active exploration strategies.
