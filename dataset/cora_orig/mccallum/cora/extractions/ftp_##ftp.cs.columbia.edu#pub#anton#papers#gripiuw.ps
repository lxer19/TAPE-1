Abstract: While existing grippers execute manipulation tasks, they occlude parts of the objects they grasp as well as parts of the workspace from vision sensors. We present the concept of a transparent gripper that enables vision sensors to image an object without occlusion while it is being manipulated. The physics of refraction, total internal reflection, lens effects, dispersion and transmittance are analyzed to determine the geometry and material properties of a practical transparent gripper. Algorithms are presented that compensate for image shifts caused by refraction. The experiments demonstrate the proposed gripper to be an effective solution to a variety of problems, including, 3D object model generation.

Reference-contexts: Here, we review the pertinent physical effects and discuss the considerations they raise in the development of a practical gripper. The optical effect of primary interest to us is the refraction of light rays as they travel from one medium to another <ref> [Born and Wolf 65] </ref>. <p> Exactly how the incident energy is divided between the two depends on the relative refractive index of the media as well as the polarization of the incoming light. For linearly polarized light, the fraction of the incident energy that is reflected and refracted (transmitted), is given by Fresnel's equations <ref> [Born and Wolf 65] </ref>: r ? = sin (ff 1 ff 2 ) 2 r k = tan (ff 1 ff 2 ) 2 Here, r ? and t ? are the reflected and refracted energies for incident light that is polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and r k

Reference-contexts: Generally, dispersion is not a severe problem, since it is always possible to use color filters and treat each wavelength component in isolation. Nevertheless, materials that exhibit less light dispersion are obviously preferred. Many plastics have almost constant refractive indices within the visible spectrum <ref> [Brydson 95] </ref>. Glass, on the other hand, is known to produce strong dispersion. 2.4 Energy Transport At a smooth interface between two media, an incident light ray generally splits into two rays: the refracted ray discussed above and a reflected ray. <p> This gripper is shown in Figure 4 holding an object (a coke can). We have seen that certain plastics have desirable material properties. We have chosen the poly (methyl methacrylate) moulding powder (commercially available as Lucite <ref> [Brydson 95] </ref>[Ash and Ash 82]). Lucite has the following important properties: low refractive index of 1.49 (critical angle 42 ffi ), negligible dispersion, high transmittance, and low light absorption. Our experiments were conducted using the Adept-1 5-DOF robot that comes with a pneumatic parallel-jaw mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Since light propagates slower in denser media, refractive indices of solids and liquids have values greater than 1.

Reference-contexts: The second application involves the task of automatic generation of 3D object models. Current approaches to measuring 3D object geometry typically involve special purpose scanning devices <ref> [Curless and Levoy 95] </ref>. Given that the shape of an object can be fairly complex, scanning it in a finite number of poses does not always suffice. In order to ensure complete shape recovery, the object has to be repositioned or regrasped during the process.

Reference-contexts: The ratio n 21 is the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first. Physics handbooks <ref> [Driscoll 78] </ref>[Childs 51] provide refractive indices of various materials measured at a given light wavelength with respect to a reference medium typically air whose refractive index is taken to be 1. Since light propagates slower in denser media, refractive indices of solids and liquids have values greater than 1.

Reference-contexts: Since specularly reflected light tends to preserve the incident polarization, a cross-polarized filter at the sensor end would help block out a large fraction of the reflected light <ref> [Mersh 84] </ref>. 3 An Example Gripper The optimal gripper would be one whose shape and material properties minimize the undesirable effects described above, namely, total internal reflections, invisible volumes, lens distortion, dispersion, low transmittance, and specular reflections.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The level of task complexity that a robot can handle is determined to a large extent by the gripper mounted on its end-effector. Grasping has been intensely studied in the past <ref> [Lundstrom et al. 77] </ref>[Kato 82][Cutkosky 89]. This has led to the design and fabrication of a panoply of grippers that range from simple parallel-jaw ones to sophisticated anthropomorphic hands. While the gripper determines the mechanical dexterity of a robot, sensory feedback determines the level of intelligence a robot can achieve.
