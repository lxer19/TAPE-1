Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some issues related to the efficient provision of end-to-end delay guarantees in the context of the Guaranteed (G) Services framework [16]. First, we consider the impact of reshaping traffic within the network on the end-to-end delay, the end-to-end jitter, as well as per-hop buffer requirements. This leads us to examine a class of traffic disciplines that use reshaping at each hop, namely rate-controlled disciplines. In this case, it is known that it is advantageous to use the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling policy at the link scheduler [8]. For this service discipline, we determine the appropriate values of the parameters that have to be exported, as specified in [16]. Subsequently, with the help of an example, we illustrate how the G service traffic will typically underutilize the network, regardless of the scheduling policy used. We then define a Guaranteed Rate (GR) service, that is synergetic with the G service framework and makes use of this unutilized bandwidth to provide rate guarantees to flows. We outline some of the details of the GR service and explain how it can be supported in conjunction with the G service in an efficient manner.

Reference-contexts: These benefits have to be traded off against the costs of reshaping, which are an increase in mean delay and the burden of implementing per connection reshapers in routers. While the need for reshaping devices in a variety of environments, e.g., ATM networks and adapters <ref> [1] </ref>, is likely to result in economies of scale that will mitigate the cost of reshaping, more work is needed to devise components that efficiently combine reshaping and scheduling. 3.1 Splitting of Flows In the context of RSVP, it is possible for a receiver that is making a reservation to specify

Reference-contexts: This example motivates the need for a service which would provide less stringent guarantees than the G service, utilizing its unused bandwidth without any adverse impact on G service flows. The desirability of such a service has been expressed by many authors <ref> [2, 12, 10] </ref>. In this paper, we propose the Guaranteed Rate (GR) service which provides the same rate guarantees as the G service, but with much looser guarantees as far as delay is concerned.

Reference-contexts: In order to better motivate the specifications in [16], as well as provide a better understanding of the G service specification, we use RSVP as an example. RSVP is a resource reservation setup protocol designed for an internet that supports Integrated services <ref> [3] </ref>. A primary design goal for RSVP was to support multicast with receivers being able to add themselves to a multicast session at will. Thus RSVP is a receiver-initiated protocol, with the resource reservation being made by the receivers. <p> The receiver uses the information in the flowspec and the adspec that it has previously received to decide the level of resources that it needs to reserve. The Resv message sent by the receiver retraces the path of the Path message (details are in <ref> [3] </ref>) and establishes the required reservation. The role of the G service specification is to allow the receiver to make an intelligent choice about the level of resources it needs to reserve in order to obtain an upper bound on the end-to-end packet delay. <p> Note that the requirement that a network element be able to reshape traffic already exists in some contexts, e.g., splitting and merging of flows as specified by the RSVP protocol <ref> [3] </ref>. As we illustrate in Sections 3.4 below, reshaping traffic within the network enhances the G-service by providing a mechanism for controlling the jitter across the network. Further, reshaping also reduces the buffer requirement at network elements (Section 3.3).

Reference-contexts: In addition, the buffer requirements at any NE can also be computed in a similar manner. These computations can be easily described in a graphical context, by using a "service curve" <ref> [6] </ref> to characterize the service provided to a flow by an NE, which is the topic of the next section. 2.2 Bounds on the Delay and Buffer Requirements First, we use the notion of an envelope process to bound the amount of traffic that arrives at the network ingress, in any <p> guarantee a service curve, S () to a flow, if for any t 0, there exists an s t such that there is no backlog of the flow at time s, and the service received by the flow in the interval [s; t) is no less than S (t s) <ref> [6] </ref>. Specifically, the service curve at NE i for a flow that has reserved a rate of R can be obtained from the parameters exported by the NE i, and is given by, S (t ) = t R i + + where [x] + maxfx; 0g. <p> A consequence of the service curve formulation is that a service curve, S i (), can be calculated for the tandem of NEs 1; 2; : : : ; i, along the path of the flow, where <ref> [6] </ref>, S i (t ) = min i X S j (t j ) : t j 0 and j=1 ) = t j=1 ! i X C j : The service curve S i (), can be used to compute an upper bound on the delay incurred by a packet <p> As shown in Figure 1, the delay bound and buffer requirements at NE i, are simply given by the horizontal and vertical distance between the traffic envelope (of the flow) and the service curve, respectively <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> On the other hand, the worst case delay encountered by the GR service flows are affected by the G service traffic, and this can be analyzed using the service curve framework <ref> [6] </ref>. Clearly, the service curves for each of the GR service flows, strongly depends on the traffic characteristics of the G service flows. Let us assume that the G service flows can be characterized by the envelopes A 0 m (t ); 1 m M .

Reference-contexts: Another aspect that we expand on in the paper, is that the RCS dis cipline allows synergetic implementations of both the G and GR services. To summarize, the contributions of this paper are twofold: * We apply the general results on rate-controlled service disciplines presented in <ref> [9] </ref> to the provision of the G service in an internet, and systematically investigate the costs and benefits of reshaping traffic at every node. The most significant of such benefits are a reduction in buffering required at switches, and an enhancement of the service through improved jitter control. <p> We refer to the combination of the shapers (for each flow) and the scheduler as the Rate Controlled Service (RCS) discipline. This is a generalized form of the RCS disciplines introduced in [22], a comprehensive study of which can be found in <ref> [9] </ref> as well. In general, any scheduler can be used in combination with the shapers, and [21] describes an implementation with a Static Priority scheduler. <p> Using (14) it can be checked (see <ref> [9] </ref> for details) that as long 6 Here deadline represents the time by which the last bit of the packet is guaranteed to have completed transmission as the sum of the reserved rates (R) of all the flows are less than the link speed, fl, the above assignment of deadlines always <p> The end- to-end delay experienced by a packet from this flow is the total propagation delay as well as the sum of the delays encountered at both the shaper and the scheduler at each NE. In <ref> [9] </ref> it was shown that for the end-to-end delay bound, it is necessary to only include an upper bound on the shaper delay at the first shaper on the path.
