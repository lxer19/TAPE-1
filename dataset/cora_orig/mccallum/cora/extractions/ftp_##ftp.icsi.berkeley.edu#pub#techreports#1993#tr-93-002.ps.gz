Abstract: We extend the recent approach of Papadimitrou and Yannakakis that relates the approximation properties of optimization problems to their logical representation. Our work builds on results by Kolaitis and Thakur who sytematically studied the expressibility classes Max n and Max n of maximization problems and showed that they form a short hierarchy of four levels. The two lowest levels, Max 0 and Max 1 coincide with the classes Max Snp and Max Np of Papadimitriou and Yannakakis; they contain only problems that are approximable in polynomial time up to a constant factor and thus provide a logical criterion for approximability. However, there are computationally very easy maximization problems, such as Maximum Connected Component (MCC) that fail to satisfy this criterion. We modify these classes by allowing the formulae to contain predicates that are definable in least fixpoint logic. In addition, we maximize not only over relations but also over constants. We call the extended classes Max FP 0 in the new hierarchy. Thus our extended class Max FP

Reference-contexts: We show that no problem in Max FP 1 can have this property, thus proving that Max Clique is not in Max FP 1 . This technique is related to limit laws for various logics [8, 17, 18] and to the probabilistic method from combinatorics <ref> [1] </ref>. We believe that this method may be of independent interest. The second method uses special classes of structures where fixpoint logic has no more expressive power than quantifier-free formulae. On such classes we can apply monotonicity arguments that break down on arbitrary finite structures. <p> In particular E (X A ) = E (X A jfi 0 ) E (X A jfi m ) = X A ( S fl ): This technique for "derandomizing" a probabilistic argument is well known. Alon and Spencer <ref> [1] </ref> call it the method of conditional expectations. 12 4 Probabilistic methods Let Q be an optimization problem whose input instances are finite structures over a fixed vocabulary .

As usual in graph theory, let !(G), ff (G) and (G) denote the size of a maximum clique, the size of a maximum independent set and the chromatic number of a graph G.

Together with our probabilistic criterion, this implies that Max Clique and Max Independent Set are not in Max FP 1 (&lt;).

Reference-contexts: They also identified a host of problems that are complete for Max Snp with respect to so-called L-reductions, which preserve polynomial-time approximation schemes. Very recently, the classes Max Snp and Max Np have received a lot of attention due to results by Arora et al. <ref> [2] </ref> showing that problems which are hard for Max Snp cannot have a Ptas, unless P = NP. We present the syntactic criterion of Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in the more general form and notation provided by Kolaitis and Thakur [15]. <p> Max Clique is in Max 1 because !(G) = max jfx : G j= Cx ^ (8y)(8z)(Cy ^ Cz) ! (y = z _ Eyz)gj It follows by simple monotonicity arguments [20] that Max Clique is not in Max 1 . Note that by very recent results in <ref> [2] </ref>, there exists an " &gt; 0 such that the Max Clique problem cannot be approximated in polynomial-time within a factor of n " .

Reference-contexts: The next stronger possible class, motivated by the existential nature of the class Max 1 is the class Max Efp defined as above with the condition that (x; S) [LFP R;z '](u) where ' is existential. In particular (x; S) is a formula in existential fixpoint logic <ref> [3] </ref> or, equivalently, a query in Datalog (:), i.e. Datalog with negations over the EDB-predicates [14]. However, this class is already too expressive. Proposition 3.5 If P 6= NP, then Max Efp contains non-approximable problems. Proof. We consider the following variant of circuit satisfiability.

Reference-contexts: We use two alternative methods. The first method, introduced in the present paper, characterizes rates of growth of average optimal solution sizes. For instance, it is known <ref> [4] </ref> that the expected size of a maximal clique in a random graph of cardinality n grows asymptotically like 2 log n. We show that no problem in Max FP 1 can have this property, thus proving that Max Clique is not in Max FP 1 . <p> Lemma 4.4 If " &gt; 0 and k (1 + ")pn, then b (n; k; p) tends to 0 exponentially fast as n goes to infinity.

Reference-contexts: Max Clique Minor (MCM). Given a graph G, find a clique of maximal size which is a minor (i.e. a contraction of a subgraph) of G. The size of such a clique is called the contraction clique number of G, abbreviated ccl (G). It is known <ref> [5] </ref> that for all almost all graphs, ccl (G) ~ n (log n) 1=2 . Longest Chordless Path (LCP). Given a graph G, find a set V of nodes, as large as possible, such that Gj V is a simple path.

Reference-contexts: An equivalence relation on n satisfies a condition u ~ v with probability jE (n 1)j=jE (n)j. The asymptotic estimate for jE (n)j (called the n-th Bell number) developed in <ref> [7] </ref> proves that his quotient tends to 0 as n goes to infinity. A tuple C of well-behaved classes is again well-behaved, in the sense that the probability that any k atomic formulae S i (u) or :S i (u) are satisfied has the properties required by Definition 3.

Reference-contexts: Until now the "structural" reasons for the different approximation properties of NP optimization problems have not been sufficiently understood. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [21] provided a new perspective by relating the approximation properties of optimization problems to their logical representation. Exploiting Fagin's characterization of NP by existential second order logic <ref> [9] </ref>, they defined two classes of optimization problems, Max Snp and Max Np, and showed that all problems in these classes are approximable in polynomial time up to a constant factor.

Reference-contexts: For some problems, there even exist so-called polynomial-time approximation schemes (Ptas), which produce approximate solutions to any desired degree of accuracy. For other problems, notably the Traveling Salesperson Problem, there do not exist efficient approximations unless P = NP (see <ref> [10] </ref>). Until now the "structural" reasons for the different approximation properties of NP optimization problems have not been sufficiently understood. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [21] provided a new perspective by relating the approximation properties of optimization problems to their logical representation.

Reference-contexts: Second, it should be noted that in most papers the definitions of the classes Max Snp and Max Np have been interpreted differently than what was originally intended in [21]. While most authors (see <ref> [11, 16, 19, 20] </ref>) understood Max Snp, respectively Max Np to be precisely Max 0 and Max 1 , Papadimitriou and Yannakakis actually had in mind their closures under the appropriate reductions (although they did not really make this clear; but see the remark in [22]).

Reference-contexts: In particular, these extended versions of Max Snp and Max Np can also contain minimization problems. Kann <ref> [13] </ref> defines yet another, intermediate version of Max Snp. We think that these different classes all have their merits, but it is important not to confuse them. <p> Does maximization over constants really give more power? We prove that it does up to the level Max FP 1 , but that for Max FP 1 and 2 , we can do without it. First of all, maximization over constants avoids trivialities. For instance, Kann <ref> [13] </ref>) observed that the proof showing that Max Clique is not in Max 1 applies even to graphs whose degree bounded by a constant d, although the problem becomes trivially solvable in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: We present the syntactic criterion of Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in the more general form and notation provided by Kolaitis and Thakur <ref> [15] </ref>. Definition 1.1 Recall that n (respectively n ) are prefix classes in first order logic, consisting of formulae in prefix normal form with n alternating blocks of quantifiers beginning with 9 (respectively 8). <p> To avoid confusion, we will use the names Max 0 and Max 1 , introduced by Kolaitis and Thakur, rather than Max Snp and Max Np. Kolaitis and Thakur <ref> [15, 16] </ref> systematically investigated the logical expressibility of optimization problems. They proved that the class Max PB, consisting of all polynomially bounded maximization problems, coincides with Max 2 and that there is proper hierarchy of four levels. <p> These include Max Clique, Max Independent Set, V-C Dimension and Max Common Induced Subgraph. To do this we have to use more sophisticated methods than the techniques of <ref> [20, 15] </ref> which break down in the presence of fixpoint definitions. We use two alternative methods. The first method, introduced in the present paper, characterizes rates of growth of average optimal solution sizes. <p> We insist that the fixpoint-predicates must not depend on the relations S over which we maximize; we therefore call them predefined fixpoint predicates. (We will discuss this condition as well as the adequacy of our definitions and possible alternatives below). The results of Kolaitis and Thakur <ref> [15] </ref> translate to these extended classes and prove Proposition 3.2 (i) Max FP 0 Max FP 2 = Max FP 2 = (ii) Min FP 1 Min FP 1 = Min PB. In this paper we will concentrate mainly on maximization problems. <p> An expression opt Q (A) = max jfx : A j= (x; c; S)gj can be translated into opt Q (A) = max jfx : A j= (9u)(8v) i The proof of Kolaitis and Thakur <ref> [15] </ref> that Max 2 = Max 1 and Max 3 = Max 2 applies also to this case and allows us to eliminate the leading existential quantifiers. Fixpoint definitions over the new predicates. <p> Thus, opt MCCPM (G) tends to 0 on graphs with odd cardinality, and to jGj on graphs of even cardinality. Corollary 4.12 Max FP 1 ( Max FP 5 Monotonicity properties The simple monotonicity properties that were used in <ref> [20, 15] </ref> to separate expressibility classes of optimization problems do not survive in the presence of fixpoint definitions. Nevertheless we can make use of them to prove inexpressibility results for Max FP 1 and 1 by looking at classes of structures where fixpoint logic collapses to 0 -formulae.

However, Kolaitis and Thakur <ref> [16] </ref> did isolate a different class (called Min F + 1 ) all whose problems are approximable. This class is a proper subclass of Min 0 .

However, we also prove that even Max FP 1 does not contain all approximable problems; in fact, it does not even contain all polynomial time optimization problems. We discuss the question of how far the class Max 1 can be extended while preserving approximability. <p> Therefore, if Q were approximable up to any constant " &gt; 0, then the corresponding approximation algorithm would solve the Circuit-Sat problem, and it would follow that P = NP. Maximization over total orderings. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [21] </ref> proposed another direction for generalization: to maximize over total orderings. A natural problem expressible in this way is Max Subdag: given a digraph G, find an acyclic subgraph of G with maximal number of edges. <p> We write the defining expression of an optimization problem in M (&lt;) on an input structure A as opt Q (A) = opt jfx : A j= (x; c; &lt;; S; P )gj: As remarked in <ref> [21] </ref> this feature does not destroy approximability: Max FP 1 APX. (We prove a more general fact below.) Note that for classes Max 1 and above, maximization over orderings does not increase the expressive power, because total orderings are axiomatizable by 1 -formulae.
