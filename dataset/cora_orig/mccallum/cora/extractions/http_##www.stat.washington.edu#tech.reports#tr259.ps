Reference-contexts: The graph provides a powerful medium with which to communicate model assumptions and derive model properties. Informative prior distributions can realistically be elicited in terms of quantities that are well understood rather than, for example, the cryptic "u"-parameters of log linear models <ref> (Bishop et al., 1975) </ref>. Furthermore, the required computations are straightforward. In later sections we extend this framework and apply it to a variety of problems. Some common themes will be apparent across these applications: First, the importance of recognising and incorporating model uncertainty has been acknowledged by many authors.

Reference-contexts: Our application concerns music expectancy, a psychological construct which has been of interest to musicians since the early part of this century <ref> (Bissell, 1921) </ref>. Music expectancy is defined as the cognitive awareness of a future event to come in music as we listen, an awareness not only of the nature of the event to come, but also of when the event will occur (Carlsen et al., 1992).

Narmour (1990) has postulated certain patterns that musical expectancy should exhibit; these theories have intensified interest in the subject. Carlsen (1981) and Unyk and Carlsen (1987) reported analyses of large music expectancy data sets.

Reference-contexts: Strayhorn was motivated specifically by the quality control of research data. He points out that while large numbers of journal pages are devoted to the quantification and control of measurement error, possible errors in data are rarely mentioned <ref> (see Feigl et al., 1982, for a notable exception) </ref>. Strayhorn (1990) presented two methods for estimating error rates in research data: the duplicate performance method and the known errors method.

Reference-contexts: For an MRS, this approach will not be as useful, because the different administrative systems may be operating simultaneously and the dependencies between them may follow some more general pattern. Log linear models provide a flexible approach to this problem, in which dependence between lists is explicitly modeled <ref> (Fienberg, 1972, Bishop et al, 1975, Hook et al, 1980) </ref>. However, as highlighted in Section 2.5, to ignore model uncertainty in this context is to ignore an important aspect of uncertainty in predicting the population size.

In the standard setup, the lithotripter operator first locates the stone via a real time ultrasound image.

Reference-contexts: The elicitability of informative prior distributions motivates many of the constructions we present in later sections. In summary, there are many advantages to analysing discrete data with Bayesian graph ical models: * Most model assumptions are entirely transparent when a graphical representation of the model is used <ref> (Lange, 1992) </ref>; * Bayesian graphical models and attendant modeling strategies provide a unified and conceptually simple framework for a diverse range of applications; * Model uncertainty can be accounted for in a straightforward fashion; * Missing data and latent variables are catered for; * Informative subjective knowledge can realistically be elicited
