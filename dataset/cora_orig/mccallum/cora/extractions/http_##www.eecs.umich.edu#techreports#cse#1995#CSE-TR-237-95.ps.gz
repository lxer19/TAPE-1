Abstract: Complex multimedia document handling, including the modeling, decomposition, and search across digital documents, is one of the primary services that must be provided by digital library systems. In this paper, we present a general approach for handling structured documents (e.g., SGML documents) by exploiting object-oriented database technology. For this purpose, we propose a constraint-based object model capable of capturing in a uniform manner all SGML constructs typically used to encode the structural organization of complex documents. We present a general strategy for mapping arbitrary document types (e.g., article, journal, and book DTDs) expressed using standard SGML into our model. Most importantly, we demonstrate that our model is designed to handle the integration of diverse document types into one integrated schema, thus avoiding the generating of numerous redundant class definitions for similar document subtypes. The resulting document management system DMS is thus capable of supporting the dynamic addition of new document types, and of uniformly processing queries spanning across multiple document types. In this paper, we also describe the implementation of our approach on the commercial DBMS system Illustra to demonstrate that the ease with which our approach can be realized on current OODB technology without requiring any special-purpose constructs. Our DMS system provides support for integrated querying of both structural as well as content-based predicates across arbitrarily complex document types.

Reference-contexts: For these reasons, much work has been initiated in recent years in integrating database (DBMS) and information retrieval (IR) technologies for developing structured document management systems <ref> [8, 9, 4, 3, 2, 7] </ref>. This research has generally proceeded in two directions: either IR systems are extended with structured representation and associated query techniques or DBMS systems are extended by incorporating IR matching techniques into their query language and access structures. <p> Most importantly, our model is designed to support the integration of multiple DTDs into one integrated system sharing class definitions among different DTDs whenever possible rather than maintaining a distinct schema for each separate DTD. Blake et al. <ref> [2] </ref> propose a mixed system combining a relational schema with SGML support to query a collection of SGML files. The SGML files are kept in the file system, while a fixed set of attributes about the documents are stored in the database. <p> As far as we know, the application of schema merging to complex document handling has not previously been studied. 7 Conclusions It has been widely recognized that document management systems that effectively manage structured digital documents should integrate functionalities of both database and information retrieval technologies <ref> [4, 8, 17, 15, 9, 2] </ref>. Towards this end, we have developed a DMS system that can handle complex mixed queries incorporating both structural as well as content-based requests. As a foundation of this system, we have introduced in this paper a formal constraint-based object model.
