Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have been applied successfully to a wide variety of modelling problems. There are extra complications when the number of parameters is not fixed. Samplers can be designed that make `reversible jumps' between subspaces that correspond to different orders of a model, but their effectiveness is dependent on a variable transformation. This article explores a number of approaches to the task of formulating moves. A structure is proposed in which moves between subspaces are combined with moves within them. This is especially useful if the latter are of a Gibbs type. Ways of enhancing computational efficiency are considered. A framework is set out for reusing the results of computations in secondary moves once a primary move has been accepted or rejected. These methods are discussed in the context of a model of a piecewise-constant signal which is filtered before the addition of noise. This model was designed with a view to analysing ion channel records.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have made possible the analysis of a wide range of data models. Recent work <ref> [6] </ref> has developed these methods so that they can be applied to models of variable dimension. Sets of related models of differing size often have an order associated with them; this article will consider hierarchical models in which there is an order parameter. <p> We consider a number of approaches to the formulation of moves between model orders. A slightly different perspective on the process of dimension matching and acceptance probability calculation to that of reversible jumps <ref> [6] </ref> is presented (section 4). This involves augmenting the smaller model to have the same number of parameters. The distribution for the extra parameters can be independent or conditional on those in the model. We also set out a framework for separable move proposals.

Reference-contexts: The equivalent histogram generated for the idealized traces, that is those where the signal is replaced by the model fit, is shown in Fig. 6 (c). In this case the components of the distributions are quite distinct. If there were more overlap mixture modelling <ref> [9] </ref> would be an appropriate technique for extracting the conductance levels. The histogram is slightly sharper (d) when p CP is reduced by a factor of about 10 to 0:003396.
