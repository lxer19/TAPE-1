Abstract: In this paper, we consider non-uniform wire-sizing under the Elmore delay model. Given a wire segment of length L, let f(x) be the width of the wire at position x, 0 x L. It was shown in [2, 5] that the optimal wire-sizing function which minimizes delay is an exponential tapering function f(x) = ae bx , where a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 are constants. Unfortunately, [2, 5] did not consider fringing capacitance which is at least comparable in size to area capacitance in deep submircon designs. As a result, exponential tapering is no longer the optimal strategy. In this paper, we show that the optimal wire-sizing function, taking fringing capacitance into consideration, is f (x) = c f W( ae bx ) +1) where n! x n is the Lambert's W function, c f and c 0 are the respective fringing capacitance and area capacitance of wire per unit square, a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 are constants. The optimal wire-sizing function degenerates into an exponential tapering function as c f = 0, and degenerates into a square-root tapering function (f (x) = b ax; where a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0) as c f ! 1. Our experimental results show that the optimal wire-sizing function can significantly reduce the interconnection delay of exponentially tapered wires. In the case where lower and upper bounds on the wire widths are given, the optimal wire-sizing function is a truncated version of the above function. Finally, our optimal wire-sizing function can be iteratively applied to optimally size all the wire segments in a routing tree for objectives such as minimizing weighted sink delay, minimizing maximum sink delay, or minimizing area subject to delay bounds at the sinks. p

Reference-contexts: We apply Newton-Raphson method to Equations (9) and (10) to solve for a and b. A good initial guess can be obtained as follows: First, chop the line into a few segments and apply the GWSA-C wire-sizing algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> to optimally size the segments (each with unform width), then extract the initial guess of a and b from the solution. Since Equations (9) and (10) indirectly depend on a and b, the partial derivatives with respect to a and b cannot be obtained by directly differentiating.

Reference-contexts: In region III, since the width of the wire is smaller, fringing capacitance dominates area capacitance, hence the shape of the wire-sizing function is similar to that of square root tapering. Remark 3. Recently, <ref> [6] </ref> independently determined the optimal wire-sizing function using calculus of variation. The optimal wire-sizing function was expressed as a power series whose coefficients had to be computed one at a time by symbolically or numerically integrating.
