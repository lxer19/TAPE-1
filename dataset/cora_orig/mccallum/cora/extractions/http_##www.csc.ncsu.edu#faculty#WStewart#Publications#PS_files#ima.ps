Reference-contexts: Therefore the accelerated power method will converge p times faster with the same amount of computation per iteration. This result may be interpreted as a consequence of the better spectral properties of R p with respect to those of S. Other iterative methods like Arnoldi, <ref> [1] </ref>, GMRES, etc., whose only involvement with a matrix involves multiplying it with a vector, can also be applied to the reduced scheme (15). Again these methods will make use of the better spectral properties of T p with respect to those of Q.

Reference-contexts: These models are said to be periodic of period p or p-cyclic of index p. Bonhoure and Dallery, <ref> [2] </ref>, have shown that Markov chains that arise from queueing network models frequently possess this property. We shall present numerical algorithms to compute the stationary probability vector of such Markov chains. Not all of the details will be presented in this version of our paper. <p> Not all of the details will be presented in this version of our paper. Rather our concern will be with presenting the main computational algorithms and we shall leave further details including proofs of theorems, certain aspects concerning implementation of preconditioning, etc. to the full paper, <ref> [2] </ref>. The discussion of iterative aggregation/disaggregation methods for Markov chains that are both nearly-completely-decomposable and cyclic which is presented in this version is not in the original version. Consider, as an example, the queueing network model described below.

Reference-contexts: In other words, if is a non-zero eigenvalue of S, then fi k k = 1; 2; ; p 1, is also an eigenvalue of S with the same multiplicity as , <ref> [3] </ref>. Since (fi k ) p = 1 for k = 0; 1; p 1, the matrix R = S p has exactly p eigenvalues equal to one and no others of modulus one. <p> It may be of interest to use either of the reduced schemes ((15) or (12)) instead of the corresponding original equation ((6) or (2)). All of the blocks R i have the same spectrum <ref> [3] </ref>. Since the eigenvalues of R are those of S raised to the power p, the spectrum of R i is more suitable for iterative methods than that of S.

Reference-contexts: i is the same, it is advantageous to work with the block of smallest size (which cannot exceed j=p). 5 A/D Methods for NCD, P-Cyclic Markov Chains 5.1 Aggregation/Disaggregation (A/D) Methods Aggregation/disaggregation (A/D) methods are iterative methods that have been used for the numerical solution of large Markov chains; (see <ref> [4, 5] </ref> and the references therein). In this section, we discuss the use of the periodicity property when implementing A/D methods for solving CTMC's that are periodic. In these methods, the state space is partitioned into a set of J blocks.
