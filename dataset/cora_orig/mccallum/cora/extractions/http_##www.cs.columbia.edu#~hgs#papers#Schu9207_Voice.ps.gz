Title: Voice Communication Across the Internet: A Network Voice Terminal

Abstract: Voice conferencing has attracted interest as a useful and viable first real-time application on the Internet. This report describes Nevot a network voice terminal meant to support multiple concurrent both two-party and multi-party conferences on top of a variety of transport protocols and using audio encodings offering from vocoder to multi-channel CD quality. As it is to be used as an experimental tool, it offers extensive configuration, trace and statistics options. The design is kept modular so that additional audio encodings, transport and real-time protocols as well as user interfaces can be added readily. In the first part, the report describes the X-based graphical user interface, the configuration and operation. The second part describes the individual components of Nevot and compares alternate implementations. An appendix covers the installation of Nevot.

A number of commercial products use medium-bitrate packet voice to more effectively utilize leased private lines, extending the concept of the traditional data-only multiplexer [14]. System implementations of packet voice terminals are described in [5, 18, 19].

Reference-contexts: AGC adjustment takes place only during silent periods. VU meters measure the short-term energy with a well-described frequency response <ref> [33] </ref>: the display should reach 99% of full scale 300 ms after applying the corresponding full-scale level, with an overshoot of between 1 and 1.5 %.

Reference-contexts: communication 27 was found to be satisfactory.) To prevent display flicker and save CPU cycles, the VU meter is updated only when the new value differs by more than the specified hysteresis from the currently displayed value. 3.9 Silence Detector The adaptive silence detector is borrowed from VTand described in <ref> [34, p. 6,7] </ref>. It computes a measure reflecting the average sample energy of the packet and declares it silent if this energy measure is below the current threshold.

Reference-contexts: For -law audio, the energy measure is the average of the sign-stripped sample values and is really a geometric mean since the sum of logarithms is equivalent to the product of the sample values). The geometric average is known to be no greater than the mean <ref> [35, p. 293] </ref>. For linearly encoded audio, we apply a -law transformation to the sample average so that we again arrive at scaled energy values of between 0 and 127. The threshold is the minimum running average, a quantity described below, plus a hysteresis.
