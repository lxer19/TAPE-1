Title: Reducing I/O Demand in Video-On-Demand Storage Servers  
Author: Leana Golubchik John C.S. Lui Richard Muntz 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have made multimedia on-demand services, such as home entertainment and home-shopping, important to the consumer market. One of the most challenging aspects of this type of service is providing access either instantaneously or within a small and reasonable latency upon request. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach, termed adaptive piggybacking, which can be used to provide on-demand or nearly-on-demand service and at the same time reduce the I/O demand on the multimedia storage server.

Reference-contexts: In general, the more video streams a system can support simultaneously, the lower is the average latency for starting the service of a new request (at least for the disk resident objects). There are several basic architectures that can be used for constructing a video-on-demand server <ref> [1, 14, 11] </ref>. The distinctions between these architectures can be (mostly) attributed to the data layout and scheduling techniques used.

Reference-contexts: There are several ways to batch requests into a single I/O stream. Due to space limitations we do not discuss batching policies here and in the remainder of the paper assume that the batching by timeout policy (see <ref> [8] </ref>) is used, 8 In either case we assume that when frames are inserted, the additional frames are some interpolation of existing frames (not simply duplicates). <p> The results are qualitatively similar, when batching is used in conjunction with adaptive piggybacking 15 ; however, due to lack of space we do not illustrate them here (see <ref> [8] </ref>). 15 Clearly, as the batching interval increases, the range of work-loads over which these policies exhibit significantly different behavior decreases.
