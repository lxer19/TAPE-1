Reference-contexts: Thus, the "meaning" of a kickon depends on the context in which it occurs. In particular, this observation can be stated in the following way: the interpretation of the information depends on which hierarchical level <ref> [1] </ref> the communicating objects belong to. In this system we have two levels: (i) the level of the free monomers and the solvent, and (ii) the level of the polymers. In general, new hierarchical levels support new means of communication, both within new levels and between old and new.

Reference-contexts: The particular choice of conceptual framework for this simulation test bed is not obvious and several frameworks might work. Some of the considerations behind our choice are discussed in the two subsections below. Other examples of discrete polymer algorithms can for instance be found in <ref> [2] </ref> and [5]. 1.2 Discrete Fields and Mechanical Models: Ba sic Considerations Cellular Automata may be viewed as computational models of physical systems. <p> Green monomers can only bond with red monomers, and vice versa. All the green monomers are updated synchronously in the first phase, and the red monomers are updated in the other. The advantage of this interleaved update scheme, 6 which was introduced by Chopard <ref> [2] </ref>, is that the neighbors of a moving monomer are guaranteed to be stationary. This simplifies other aspects of the update algorithm significantly. 2.3.2 The Solvent (kickons) First the velocities of all the monomers are randomized.

Reference-contexts: Suppose that the end-to-end vector r is the result of a random walk. Then the probability of end-to-end length r will be p (r) = Ae where fi = 2N a 2 d being the dimensionality of the space the polymer inhabits and a the bond length <ref> [3] </ref>. The constant A can be found by normalization. <p> Also note that even after approximately 10N 5=2 updates (N = 13) the cumulative averages of R g |and in particular of R 0 |are still varying substantially. It is known <ref> [3] </ref> that R 0 and R g for ideal polymers should scale as N 3=4 in the theoretical limit.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that this is not the only way to generate long range fields through a particle propagation. Molecular self-assembly is easily obtained using classical cellular automata and movable finite automata <ref> [4] </ref>. For the LPA polymerization can for instance be obtained by allowing oppositely charged end-monomers (monomers with one free bond) to ignore each other's repellons and thus form bonds once the attracting forces have brought the polymer ends within distance one.

Some of the considerations behind our choice are discussed in the two subsections below. Other examples of discrete polymer algorithms can for instance be found in [2] and <ref> [5] </ref>. 1.2 Discrete Fields and Mechanical Models: Ba sic Considerations Cellular Automata may be viewed as computational models of physical systems. They embody discrete field models: space and time are divided into a lattice of cells of finite size, each of which occupies one of a discrete set of states. <p> A refresh step which copies the modified information in the other layer back to the original one, plus erasure of the repellons, completes the first phase of the update cycle. In the second phase, the green particles will be stationary and the red will move. Smith et al. <ref> [5] </ref> have remarked that this sort of interleaved update scheme violates detailed balance, but that this can be respected by chosing stochastically which set of monomers to update.

Reference-contexts: Instead of assigning one molecule to each processor, each processor is responsible for a discrete part of space (a cell) with one or more molecules, whose number (may) change over time as a function of the dynamics. One of the currently fastest Molecular Dynamics codes <ref> [6] </ref> uses approximately 0:2610 6 sec/(particle-update) on the CM-5 Connection machine having approximately 20 10 6 particles. Each particle update corresponds to some femto (10 15 ) seconds real time and a typical simulation runs for some thousand updates.

Reference-contexts: Without an explicit representation of the functional elements, autonomous construction of novel structures and properties is not possible, and the system will not be self-programmable.

Reference-contexts: finite number of others, a pure mechanical Molecular Dynamics technique clearly will not scale up with n. 1.3 Lattice Gas Automata as Models of Physics Our model is inspired by Lattice Gas Automata, LGA, one of the first Cellular Automata to be used for accurate modeling of complex physical systems <ref> [10] </ref>. In LGA microscopic conservation laws encoded in the local rules produce physically realistic dynamics one level higher. From a microphysics that conserves particle number and momentum emerge continuous density and velocity fields that are solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid flow.

Reference-contexts: per update in the LPA range from 10 9 - 10 1 seconds, depending on which molecules we are simulating, it becomes possible to trace some of the molecular self-organizing processes which occur on timescales as long as hours, as for instance the formation and self-replication of mi-celles and liposomes <ref> [12] </ref>. 5.5 Self-Organization The main thrust of our efforts are now concentrated on the introduction of LPA long range forces, polymerization as well as hydrophobicity and hydropilicity.

Reference-contexts: Long range forces can of course also be carried by particles (photons). There are several ways to generate discrete electromagnetic fields by means of propagating particles <ref> [13] </ref>. Since the field due to an impulse charge is a function only of distance, (~ 1=r 2 in 3D and ~ 1=r in 2D) it is possible to generate an electromagnetic field in an update time which is proportional to the distance from the source.
