Title: Retrieving Images by Similarity of Visual Appearance  
Author: S. Ravela R. Manmatha 
Address: Amherst  
Affiliation: Multimedia Indexing and Retrieval Group University of Massachusetts,  
Abstract: A system to retrieve images using a description of visual appearance is presented. A multi-scale invariant vector representation is obtained by first filtering images in the database with Gaussian derivative filters at several scales and then computing low order differential invariants. The multi-scale representation is indexed for rapid retrieval. Queries are designed by the users from an example image by selecting appropriate regions. The invariant vectors corresponding to these regions are matched with those in the database both in feature space as well as in coordinate space and a match score is obtained for each image. The results are then displayed to the user sorted by the match score. From experiments conducted with over 1500 images of objects embedded in arbitrary backgrounds, it is shown that images similar in appearance and whose viewpoint is within 25 degrees of the query image can be retrieved with an average precision 1 of 57.4%.

Reference-contexts: This set or vector of responses, called a multi-scale feature vector, is obtained solely from the signal content and without the use of "global context" or "symbolic interpretation". Further, the family of Gaussian filters are unique in their ability to describe the scale-space or deep structure <ref> [2, 4, 1] </ref> of a function and are well suited for representing appearance. In this paper we first verify, using correlation, that the proposed representation can retrieve visually similar images within small view and a range of size variation (see Section 4). <p> Then, to overcome the limitations of the correlation approach, an indexable strategy for image retrieval is then developed using feature vectors constructed from combinations of the derivative filter outputs. These combinations yield a set of differential invariants <ref> [1] </ref> that are invariant to two-dimensional rigid transformations. Retrieval is achieved in two computational steps. During the off-line computation phase each image in the database is first filtered at sampled locations and then filter responses across the entire database are indexed (see Section 5). <p> The choice of the Gaussian as the smooth test function, as opposed to others, is motivated by the fact that it is unique in describing the scale-space or deep structure of an arbitrary function. For a review of scale space, the reader is referred to <ref> [8, 2, 1, 4] </ref>. Scale-space has an important physical interpretation in that it models the change in appearance of an imaged object as it moves away from a camera. An argument is therefore made for a multi-scale feature vector which describes the intensity surface locally at several scales. <p> As a consequence, in this paper the multi-scale vector is computed at three different scales placed half an octave apart. 5.1 Multi-Scale Invariant Vectors Given the derivatives of an image I, irreducible differential invariants (invariant under the group of displacements) can be computed in a systematic manner <ref> [1] </ref>. The value of these entities is independent of the choice of coordinate frame (up to rotations).

Reference-contexts: The multi-scale feature vector are transformed so that the elements within this vector are invariant to 2D rigid transformations. This transformed feature vector is called the multi-scale invariant vector. The local N-jet of I (x) at scale and order N is defined as the set <ref> [3] </ref>: J N [I] (x;) = fI i 1 :::i n ; jn = 0 : : : N g (1) where I i 1 :::i n ; (x) = (I ?

Reference-contexts: Due to lack of space, the reader is referred to <ref> [5] </ref> for a review of the literature. Gaussian derivative representations have also been used in the context of recognition. Indexed differen selecting the box shown tial invariants have recently been used [7] for object recognition. We also index on differential invariants but there are several differences compared with [7]. <p> Several other approaches in the literature take the entire feature set or some global representation 2 see Figure 2 for the results over the entire image (see <ref> [5] </ref> for examples). While this may be reasonable for certain types of retrieval, it cannot necessarily be used for general purpose retrieval.Therefore, we believe that the natural human ability in selecting salient regions must be exploited. <p> The average precision (over recall intervals of 10 4 ) is 48.6%. Five other queries that were also submitted are depicted in Table 2. Due to lack of space detailed explanations are not provided and the reader is referred to <ref> [5] </ref> for details. The recall/precision table over these five queries is in Table 3. The average precision over all the queries is a 57.4%. This compares well with text retrieval where some of the best systems have an average precision of 50% 5 . Unsatisfactory retrieval occurs for several reasons.

Reference-contexts: The feature vector used is the local 2-jet (without the zeroth order term), computed at a fixed scale <ref> [6] </ref> i.e., hI x ; I y ; I xx ; I xy ; I yy i , computed at scale , Using this representation in conjunction with correlation, we verify that, at any scale a reasonable retrieval of visually similar images is possible. <p> Note that similar images within the database occur at different sizes. While the above mentioned method as stated does not account for large relative size changes between a query and a matching database image, however, it has been extended to handle a range of size changes, discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>. From the experiments (see Section 7) the following observations are made. First, vector correlation performs well under small view variations. Typically, in-plane rotations of up to 20 o and out-of-plane rotations of up to 30 o can be tolerated. <p> Second, a range of size variations, determined a priori, can be handled by searching across the scale parameter of the Gaussian. In particular similar objects within size changes of 1 4 : : : 4 could be retrieved <ref> [6] </ref>. Finally it is observed that as images become more dissimilar their response vectors become less correlated, starting at the higher order. <p> For the steam query there are 12 "similar" images (as determined by a person), 9 of which are ranked in the top 20. Finally, for the diesel query there are 30 "similar" images, 12 of which are found in the top 20 retrievals. Pictorial results are shown in <ref> [6] </ref>. Wrong instances of retrieval are of two types. The first is where the correlation performs well but the objective of the query is not satisfied. In this case the query will have to be redesigned. <p> These images are also observed to be visually similar and we posit that this method has good potential for image retrieval. While a discussion of matching objects across different sizes was presented and has been implemented elsewhere <ref> [6] </ref> using correlation, in this paper, the multi-scale invariant vector was used only to robustly characterize appearance. The next immediate step is to explicitly incorporate matching across size variations akin to the correlation approach.
