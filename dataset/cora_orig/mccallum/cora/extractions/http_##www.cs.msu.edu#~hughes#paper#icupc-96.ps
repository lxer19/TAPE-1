Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the issue of extending the ATM protocol to support connection handoffs. A VP-based hierarchical handoff scheme is proposed to support ATM protocol over the integration of the wireless and wireline networks. This scheme provides a fast and efficient handoff connection processing mechanism. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol, we implement it on our ATM network testbed. The mobility of MHs is investigated by using the Ethernet network to simulate the wireless segment between mobile hosts and base stations.

Reference-contexts: Such extension will eliminate excessive overhead and delay due to protocol conversion. In order to avoid a serious mismatch between wireline and wireless network capabilities, it is now timely to begin consideration of supporting smooth transportation of multimedia traffic from wired ATM networks to a wireless environment <ref> [1] </ref>. Several challenging issues must be addressed before the success of integrating wireline and wireless networks, based on the ATM standard.

Reference-contexts: This is the processing time on a BS plus the round trip time between the MH workstation and the BS workstation over an Ethernet network. This value is close to the range of values on actual wireless networks with a 2 ms wireless frame <ref> [2] </ref>. The round trip time of handoff connection requests in Figure 4 is changing dramatically. Such change occurs because the context switching between threads. Nevertheless, the average round trip time is about 360 ms.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, intra- and inter-cluster connection hand-offs can be implemented by current ATM protocol without major modification. Hence, this eliminates the need of searching the common network node in <ref> [3, 6] </ref>, which will incur substantial overhead during a connection handoff. 2.1 Assumption In this scheme, we assume that every BS periodically broadcasts a beacon signal with its ATM ID within its radio coverage.

Reference-contexts: This implies that extra overhead will apply to the network system during the handoff session. Moreover, providing more bandwidth in each radio cell, the future wireless environment will adopt a micro-cell or pico-cell scheme, which in turn increases the frequency of handoff <ref> [4] </ref>. Therefore, a fast and efficient handoff protocol is not only highly desirable but essential for the success of wireless ATM networks. In this paper, a handoff protocol for wireless ATM networks and a hierarchical wireless ATM network model are proposed.

Reference-contexts: We further assume that handoffs only occur between adjacent BSs. The multiple overlapping handoff issue in <ref> [5] </ref> is beyond the scope of this paper. To assist the handoff process, each domain (a cluster or a region) is assigned with a particular segment of ATM addresses. That is, each CC within a region is located in a unique segment of ATM addresses.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, intra- and inter-cluster connection hand-offs can be implemented by current ATM protocol without major modification. Hence, this eliminates the need of searching the common network node in <ref> [3, 6] </ref>, which will incur substantial overhead during a connection handoff. 2.1 Assumption In this scheme, we assume that every BS periodically broadcasts a beacon signal with its ATM ID within its radio coverage. <p> We choose multithreaded programming technique to implement the software as it provides better performance and reduces the overhead of inter-process communication at user level. Each connection is handled by two partner threads (input thread and output thread). Being aware of the problems of the double-threaded suck-spit model described in <ref> [6] </ref>, we choose to it as we are not focusing on the preservation of the traffic pattern, but the feasibility of our handoff protocol. In the implementation of the software, we use FORE's ATM API and Sun's multithreaded programming library.

Reference-contexts: The BHO cell is a F5 flow Operation and Maintenance (OAM) cell which has the same VPI/VCI values as the user-data cells but is identified by pre-assigned code points of the Payload Type field <ref> [7] </ref>. It allows one end point of a VP, such as MHs or CCs, to notify the other end of the status of a particular Virtual Circuit (VC) in the VP. <p> Otherwise, it will result in either retransmitting all cells in the higher layer's packet unit or discarding out of order cells <ref> [7] </ref>. To explain this, let's examine the intra-cluster cases. For uplink handoffs, when a CC detects an in-band BHO cell of a handoff connection from the current BS, it notices that this is the end of transmission of this VC connection before the handoff occurs.
