Abstract: We describe a study to determine the feasibility of using automatic speech recognition to collect information over the telephone for the Year 2000 Census in the United States. The stages of research are protocol development, speech data collection and transcription, system development, and system evaluation. We developed a rapid pro-totyping methodology to produce two protocols now being used to collect data from callers solicited by the Bureau of the Census and have collected 1000 speech calls. Two hundred calls have been transcribed at the word level. Initial results are reported for a baseline system tested on the transcribed calls. The baseline system is both speaker and vocabulary independent|it has not been trained on words from the recognition vocabulary. The system's error rate ranges between 2% and 21% for responses to the prompts.
