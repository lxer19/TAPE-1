Reference-contexts: As a result, the process of understanding and tuning application level performance is often an ad hoc process, lacking in the kinds of models and tools that are enjoyed by other engineering disciplines. In a previous paper <ref> [1] </ref>, we proposed a "gray-box approach" for measuring machine performance through the use of micro-benchmarks, and applied it to the problem of compiling a global address space language on the Cray T3D. <p> The T3D offers a large menu of primitives for implementing remote accesses, but there are performance problems and correctness issues that render some of these unusable <ref> [1] </ref>. First, it does not correctly support partial word stores, which means that data structures such as character arrays are cumbersome to implement. <p> The total cost seen by the programmer is shown in Figures 4 and 5. Eliminating Annex setup costs requires complex program analysis (as discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>) as the compiler has to ensure that physical address synonyms are not generated. However, on the T3E, the Split-C implementation does not incur any additional cost beyond the raw hardware performance.
