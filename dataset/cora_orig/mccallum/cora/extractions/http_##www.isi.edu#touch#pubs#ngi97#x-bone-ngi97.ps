Reference-contexts: Overlay networks are protocol or application specific subnets connected by IP encapsulation tunnels over production networks. Overlays are configured and managed manually and independently of each other and the underlying infrastructure. Recent overlays support new protocols such as the M-Bone for multicast IP [5], and the 6-Bone for IPv6 <ref> [1] </ref>, application networks such as the distributed Harvest cache system [3], and experiment networks such as for the Digital Libraries Initiative [4]. The X-Bone is a system for the rapid deployment and management of multiple overlay networks.

Reference-contexts: These exploit the results of other research and development efforts, such as Argonnes MorphNet <ref> [2] </ref>, which would provide reservation services to native infrastructure at the link and physical layers. We believe the X-Bone offers the existing Internet infrastructure a path to providing rapidly deployable virtual infrastructure with the same ubiquity as current services enjoy.

Reference-contexts: Overlays are configured and managed manually and independently of each other and the underlying infrastructure. Recent overlays support new protocols such as the M-Bone for multicast IP [5], and the 6-Bone for IPv6 [1], application networks such as the distributed Harvest cache system <ref> [3] </ref>, and experiment networks such as for the Digital Libraries Initiative [4]. The X-Bone is a system for the rapid deployment and management of multiple overlay networks. The X-Bones coordinated management supports both long-lived and short-lived large scale overlay networks with little manual intervention. <p> Current overlay networks are composed of per-overlay routing daemon software installed at selected sites, connected by IP-encapsulation tunnels [8]. Application overlay networks use existing networking infrastructure together with application-layer routing, e.g., to interconnect proxies of a cache distribution system as in Harvest <ref> [3] </ref>. Interference between overlays is currently managed by system administrators. The X-Bone uses an interface and resource discovery protocol adapted from the sd and sdr M-Bone tools [5]. Sd and sdr are session directory tools that advertise multiple M-Bone multicast sessions on a single, global multicast channel.

Sd and sdr are session directory tools that advertise multiple M-Bone multicast sessions on a single, global multicast channel. A similar X-Bone directory tool, xd, provides an equivalent interface to multiple X-Bone overlay networks.

Reference-contexts: This would provide automatic tunnel connectivity of daemons that are deployed via script control of a network manager, using out-of-band mechanisms or emerging tunnel management protocols <ref> [6] </ref>. Second phase X-Bone tools (second year) will be interfaced to emerging distributed security infrastructure and resource reservation services. This phase provides resource partitioning and automated daemon deployment.

Reference-contexts: When an site joins an overlay, its xd tool requests an authenticated copy of the appropriate daemon software and configuration information. These overlay networks can be composed from host-based routers initially, and use Active Networks (AN) to load code at dedicated routers, when available <ref> [7] </ref>. Xd provides a uses ANs programmability, and supplies a tool to manage distributed coordination and code deployment. Xd also coordinates the sharing of resources at the local site, and provides a single interface to RSVP, to allow configuration of link reservations that span an entire overlay.

Reference-contexts: The X-Bone The X-Bone consists of existing overlay technology combined with teleconferencing-style management tools and advanced coordination services. Current overlay networks are composed of per-overlay routing daemon software installed at selected sites, connected by IP-encapsulation tunnels <ref> [8] </ref>. Application overlay networks use existing networking infrastructure together with application-layer routing, e.g., to interconnect proxies of a cache distribution system as in Harvest [3]. Interference between overlays is currently managed by system administrators.

Reference-contexts: Xd also coordinates the sharing of resources at the local site, and provides a single interface to RSVP, to allow configuration of link reservations that span an entire overlay. This allows NGI Workshop 97 xd to support resource reservation (e.g., RSVP <ref> [10] </ref>) without requiring implementation in each overlays daemon. Xd also provides a user interface and API, which allows external programs or users to manually override and parameterize the overlays. Benefits of the X-Bone The X-Bone provides isolation between overlay networks.
