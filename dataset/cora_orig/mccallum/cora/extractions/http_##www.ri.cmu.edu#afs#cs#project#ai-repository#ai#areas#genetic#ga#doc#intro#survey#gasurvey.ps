Title: Genetic Algorithm Programming Environments

Abstract: Interest in Genetic algorithms is expanding rapidly. This paper reviews software environments for programming Genetic Algorithms ( GA s). As background, we initially preview genetic algorithms' models and their programming. Next we classify GA software environments into three main categories: Application-oriented, Algorithm-oriented and ToolKits. For each category of GA programming environment we review their common features and present a case study of a leading environment.

Reference-contexts: Overview Educational systems are typically implemented on PC s for portability and low cost reasons. For ease of use, they have a nice graphical interface and are fully menu-driven. GA Workbench is one of the best examples of this class of programming environments. Case Study GA Workbench GA Workbench <ref> [9] </ref> has been developed by Mark Hughes from Cambridge Consultants Ltd. It is a mousedriven interactive GA program that runs on MS DOS/PC-DOS microcomputers. The system is aimed at people wishing to understand and get hands-on GA practice. Evaluation functions are drawn on screen, using a mouse.
