Abstract: Object Designers Limited 1996. Permission is granted for this paper to be copied for distribution to workshop attendees only. OOPSLA 96 Abstract Types define object interfaces. Two or more types can be safely combined into a single subtype by following defined rules. Might not this principle be used as the basis for subjectivity by using types as viewpoints of an object from different subject areas? This paper points out some difficulties in using types in this manner within the rule set defined by the Syntropy method, and concludes A major goal of subjectivity is the partial definition of object interfaces. Each subject area may define its own interface for an object, which I will call a viewpoint, that contains just the features relevant to that subject area. However an object must have the same identity irrespective of the subject area from which it is viewed, otherwise it could not easily be shared between areas or passed from area to area. Therefore, it is necessary for objects simultaneously to support multiple interfaces. Furthermore, a central tenet of subjectivity (as I understand it) is that there shall be no central, consolidated implementation of these interfaces that acts as a single point of reference. If there were, then it would be necessary to update the centralised implementation each time a subject area is added, removed or modified. In this paper I will use the word type to mean object interface. Typically, types are implemented by classes. The complete separation of type definitions from class definitions is increasing common; see, for example Java and CORBA IDL. At first sight the problems of subjectivity at a modelling level seem very similar to those of combining multiple types into a single subtype. Achieving a proper definition of sub-typing formed a major part of the work I did with Steve Cook on Syntropy [Cook & Daniels 1994]. In that work we formulated rules controlling the interaction between both the syntactic (i.e. feature signature) and dynamic (i.e. behaviour as expressed by statecharts) aspects of sub-types. This paper examines the feasibility of using type combination as defined by Syntropy as the basis for subjectivity. that either the rules must be changed or another approach found.
