Abstract: Consider a single server queue with unit service rate fed by an arrival process of the following form : Sessions arrive at the times of a Poisson process of rate , with each session lasting for an independent integer time t 1, where P (t = k) = p k with p k ~ ffk (1+ff) L(k), where 1 &lt; ff &lt; 2 and L() is a slowly varying function. Each session brings in work at unit rate while it is active. Thus the work brought in by each arrival is regularly varying, and, because 1 &lt; ff &lt; 2, the arrival process of work is long-range dependent. Assume that the stability condition E[t ] &lt; 1 holds. By simple arguments we show that for any stationary nonpreemptive service policy at the queue, the stationary sojourn time of a typical session must stochastically dominate a regularly varying random variable having infinite mean; this is true even if the duration of a session is known at the time it arrives. On the other hand, we show that there exist causal stationary preemptive policies, which do not need knowledge of the session durations at the time of arrival, for which the stationary sojourn time of a typical session is stochastically dominated by a regularly varying random variable having finite mean. These results indicate that scheduling policies can have a significant influence on the extent to which long-range dependence in the arrivals influences the performance of communication networks.

Reference-contexts: In particular this is a regularly varying distribution with infinite mean. Let S have the distribution of the stationary sojourn time of a typical session. Because Poisson arrivals see time averages (PASTA), see <ref> [4] </ref>, [24], this distribution is the same as that of a marked session that, at time 0, enters the stationary system. <p> But the workload seen by a typical arrival to this queue can be expressed as the maximum of a random walk with negative drift, using the familiar Lindley equation for the workload in a single server FCFS queue <ref> [4] </ref>, [21]. Since we find it convenient to refer to certain formulas derived in [11], pp. 408 -412 we will instead express the workload as the minimum of a random walk with positive drift this just involves a change of sign in Lindley's equation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The past few years have witnessed an increasing interest in the phenomenon of long-range dependence in communication network traffic. This interest was sparked by a number of papers that presented statistical analyses of measurements of communication traffic from a wide variety of sources, see for instance <ref> [5] </ref>, [14], and [18]. In particular, a number of papers have studied analytical models of queues driven by long-range dependent arrivals, with the goal of deriving insights about the performance of communication networks that need to handle such traffic.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a number of papers have studied analytical models of queues driven by long-range dependent arrivals, with the goal of deriving insights about the performance of communication networks that need to handle such traffic. Examples of such papers include [1], [2], [12], [13], [15], [16], [17], <ref> [19] </ref>, and [20]. A feature of most of these works is the observation that the tail behavior of queues with long-range dependent inputs decays much slower than exponentially, either as a Weibull law or according to a power law, depending on the model. <p> The persistence of long-range dependence in packet traffic even after it is regulated by flow control schemes closely related to those that have been standardized for use in practice is demonstrated in <ref> [19] </ref>. This further strengthens the case for the importance of studying the effects of long-range dependence on queueing systems. A bibliography of work in this area as of the middle of 1996 is available in [22]. <p> Following Cox [9], equation (1) says, by definition, that (A (t); t 2 R) is long-range dependent. The arrival model described above is very similar to the ones considered in several earlier papers, e.g. [1], [2], [12], [13], [15], [17], <ref> [19] </ref>, and the practical relevance of considering arrival models of this type has been argued in [23] and [13]. 3 Some Preliminaries It is convenient to gather in one place some notation that will be used in the subsequent discussion.

Reference-contexts: But the workload seen by a typical arrival to this queue can be expressed as the maximum of a random walk with negative drift, using the familiar Lindley equation for the workload in a single server FCFS queue [4], <ref> [21] </ref>. Since we find it convenient to refer to certain formulas derived in [11], pp. 408 -412 we will instead express the workload as the minimum of a random walk with positive drift this just involves a change of sign in Lindley's equation.

A bibliography of work in this area as of the middle of 1996 is available in <ref> [22] </ref>. This paper is another contribution to understanding the effect that long-range dependent traffic can have on the performance of communication networks. Our goal here is to investigate the role of scheduling policies in controlling such effects.

Reference-contexts: Our choice of arrival model was made for technical convenience, and because there are strong arguments in favor of the relevance of arrival models of the Cox type [9] we consider, see <ref> [23] </ref> and [13]. It is natural to expect that similar results will hold for more general arrival processes, e.g. for a Cox type arrival process where the session durations are of the subexponential class, see [3] and [12] for more on such arrival processes. <p> The arrival model described above is very similar to the ones considered in several earlier papers, e.g. [1], [2], [12], [13], [15], [17], [19], and the practical relevance of considering arrival models of this type has been argued in <ref> [23] </ref> and [13]. 3 Some Preliminaries It is convenient to gather in one place some notation that will be used in the subsequent discussion. <p> We chose a Cox type arrival process, because of its analytical tractability and because it has been argued to be a good match for the mechanisms that generate long-range dependence in practice, see <ref> [23] </ref> and [13]. Within the framework of our model, we have demonstrated that the scheduling policy can have a dramatic influence on the performance seen by typical sessions.

Reference-contexts: In particular this is a regularly varying distribution with infinite mean. Let S have the distribution of the stationary sojourn time of a typical session. Because Poisson arrivals see time averages (PASTA), see [4], <ref> [24] </ref>, this distribution is the same as that of a marked session that, at time 0, enters the stationary system.
