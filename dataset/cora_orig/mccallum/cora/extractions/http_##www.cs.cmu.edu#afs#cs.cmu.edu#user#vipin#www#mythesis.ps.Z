Reference-contexts: One important benefit for SQP is its ability to be modified in order to take advantage of a particular problem structure. This is especially important for large, sparse systems that include problems in parameter estimation <ref> [2] </ref>, multiperiod optimization [98] and dynamic optimization [94]. However, one hurdle in exploiting the problem structure is an efficient strategy for treating inequality constraints in the QP subproblem. <p> One important benefit for SQP is its ability to be modified in order to take advantage of a particular problem structure.

Reference-contexts: In the following section, we will see how rSQP could be used to interpret predictor-corrector methods. 5.3.2 Interpretation of Interior Point Methods with Reduced Hessian SQP To interpret the predictor-corrector method, let us pose the subproblem (5.6) as (5.25) with the optimality conditions (5.7)-(5.9) as constraints as in <ref> [3] </ref>. Note that the comple mentarity constraint is different from (5.10) and (5.13). min f (q) Ax = b SV e = qe (5.25) Since (5.25) has just 1 degree of freedom (q), consider the iterative solution of (5.25) in the context of a reduced Hessian SQP (rSQP) framework. <p> As seen from the figure, the number of iterations for MINOS and QPSOL increase with the number of time steps (active constraints), whereas the interior point method keeps at a constant 6 iterations. In a related work <ref> [3] </ref>, model predictive control of the reactor in the Tennesse Eastman challenge problem [41] was considered. Application of interior point methods on that problem demonstrated considerable savings in computational time as well, as opposed to active set methods. CHAPTER 5. <p> Devising ways of efficiently CHAPTER 7. CONCLUSIONS 140 solving the linear systems arising at each interior point iteration could be considered in the future. Some preliminary results obtained using Harwell subroutines MA27 and MA28 are described in <ref> [3] </ref>. * Replacement of active set methods with an interior point strategy allows us to revisit a variety of currently used algorithms in process engineering and identify the problems where such a strategy could make a huge difference.

Reference-contexts: Global Minima of Gibbs Free Energy A particular phase composition is stable if it satisfies the tangent plane criteria (Baker et al. <ref> [6] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: An equally relevant problem is the one concerning reinitialization. Discrete changes in the modeling equations are marked by the occurrence of an event, which is usually triggered by a certain condition becoming true (Barton <ref> [10] </ref>). Reinitialization after a discontinuity is an even tougher problem as it involves the additional exercise of determining the subset of variables which are continuous across a discontinuity. In Chapter 3, we develop an approach based on SLP for the initialization and reinitialization after discontinuities of DAEs. <p> For example, when an analog control loop involving integral action is switched to automatic control, the integral of the controller error is normally initialized to zero causing a step change. Other examples include dumping of the reactant or catalyst into a batch reactor (Barton <ref> [10] </ref>). In such cases, it would not be possible to use the polynomial approximations for the differential variables to do the initialization calculation using such a procedure.

Reference-contexts: NONSMOOTH DYNAMIC SIMULATION 79 rium calculations, especially in an equation oriented simulation environment, is that the number of phases is not known a priori. Among the different approaches suggested to tackle this problem, the classical sequential modular approach is the most familiar one (Boston and Britt <ref> [19] </ref>, Nelson [77]). In general, these methods calculate the bubble and dew points ( in the case of two phase calculations) and then determine the number of phases at equilibrium. The set of equations applicable to that particular phase behavior is then solved.

Reference-contexts: SLP ALGORITHM 10 Synopsis Bullard and Biegler <ref> [24] </ref> developed a Successive Linear Programming (SLP) algorithm for solving a system of nonlinear equations constrained by inequalities and variable bounds. In this chapter, we modify the SLP algorithm by introducing a descent strategy combining two major classes of descent: line search and trust region methods. <p> This requires reformulation of Newton's method which retains its quadratic convergence rate while avoiding its numerical problems. Bullard and Biegler <ref> [24] </ref> introduced a technique based on successive linear programming for solving (CSP). The basic idea of the approach is to convert the equation solving problem to an optimization problem. <p> The implementation for the algorithm by Bullard and Biegler <ref> [24] </ref> uses the traditional monotonic, Armijo-type line search [4]. <p> This criterion is somewhat conservative and, if, in addition, i * 2 , then the problem is solved. Otherwise, x i is only a stationary point which we term as a pseudosolution. Heuristic strategies for recovering from a pseudosolution (e.g. rescaling the problem) are described by Bullard and Biegler <ref> [24] </ref>. In the following section we consider some theoretical properties on this framework. 2.4 Theoretical Properties 2.4.1 Definitions and Assumptions In this section, we present global convergence properties of the combined line search - trust region method. For this purpose, we first define some terms used in the convergence analysis. <p> The tolerance specified was that the 1-norm of the constraint violations be less than 10 7 . The numerical results for the solution of these problems without scaling are listed in Table 2.1. The individual problem descriptions could be found in Bullard and Biegler <ref> [24] </ref> (The numbers in parentheses in column 1 refer to the problem numbers used in that paper). CHAPTER 2.

Traditionally, numerical methods have used one of the two major classes of methods to ensure descent: line search or trust region.

Reference-contexts: Nonsmooth dynamic simulation involves transition from one state of the system to another, or in other words, a change from one set of equations describing the process to another. To initialize the problem, smooth inequality constraints can be added to the LP formulation as described in Bullard and Biegler <ref> [25] </ref> to determine the set of equations which are initially active. Once this is known, we need to keep track of the logical conditions triggering a change from this model to a different one. Here the switching functions come into play. <p> Traditional methods for solving these problems involves and if-then-else iterative procedure which solves the problem assuming certain valve positions and resolves them with different valve positions if any conditionals are violated. This procedure could be cumbersome and could fail to converge for large systems. Bullard and Biegler <ref> [25] </ref> introduced continuous and mixed integer formulations which handles switching of valve positions through inequality constraints. This approach is elegant and more appropriate for an optimization framework. However, in a pure equation solving environment, one would rather not introduce inequality constraints, if they can be avoided. <p> SMOOTHING METHODS 129 using second order information, it could be approximated as H ij = Ksign (Q ij )Q 2 ij = KQ ij abs (Q ij ) KQ ij [Q ij + ff The data and the listing of the initial guesses could be found in Bullard and Biegler <ref> [25] </ref>. All the valves were specified as open as initial conditions, though valves in pipes 15, 32 and 34 are closed at the solution of the problem. For the pipeline network with 5 valves, the smoothing method solved the problem in 16 iterations using algorithm 6.4. <p> For the pipeline network with 5 valves, the smoothing method solved the problem in 16 iterations using algorithm 6.4. This is comparable to 14 and 19 iterations required for solution using mixed integer and continuous formulations respectively in <ref> [25] </ref>. MINOS took 82 iterations to solve the original nonsmooth problem. 6.6 Conclusions In this chapter, we considered some recent developments in the applicability of smoothing methods to solve the complementarity problem.

Reference-contexts: Such a procedure based approach, however, can be difficult to incorporate in an equation oriented simulation environment. Phase equilibrium problems are an important class of problems which can be addressed using our LP-based method. Bullard and Biegler <ref> [26] </ref> applied a penalty based extension of their LP formulation, P-SONATA, to deal with two phase vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE) problems. The basic idea of their formulation was to introduce a pseudo pressure P P and use it to solve the equilibrium expression in all the regions. <p> This could be done by relaxing the equilibrium constant itself, rather than dealing with pressure as in Bullard and Biegler <ref> [26] </ref>. NLP (4.24) is formulated based on such a relaxation. Thus the new formulation is not limited to VLE systems and could be used for multiphase systems as well. <p> CHAPTER 6. SMOOTHING METHODS 122 Example 1: 2 component 2-phase ideal column operating under minimum reflux In this example we consider a 25-tray distillation column with a saturated liquid feed of 70% benzene - 30% toluene to tray 7, as described by <ref> [26] </ref>. Ideal thermodynamics is used to model phase equilibrium. <p> Example 2: 5 component 2-phase nonideal column operating under minimum reflux The second example is a 17-tray nonideal distillation column with a saturated liquid feed of 15 % methanol - 40 % acetone - 5 % methacrylate - 20 % benzene - 20 % chloroform to tray 12 <ref> [26] </ref>. The liquid phase is modeled with UNIQUAC and virial equations are used to model the vapor phase. In table 6.2, we show the number of iterations for solving the column for different reflux ratios, for this highly nonlinear model.

Reference-contexts: Equation oriented simulators also need to deal with nonsmooth relations, characterized by discontinuous derivatives or kinks, which are often enforced as procedures in the sequential modular mode. Some of these issues have been addressed by Bullard <ref> [27] </ref> in the context of steady state simulation. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 3 Of increasing interest in the simulation community is the development of efficient dynamic simulation tools.

Reference-contexts: However the structurally determined index and degrees of freedom will only provide a lower bound and upper bound respectively for their corresponding differential quantities. They also proposed a combination of structural methods with numerical/symbolic methods to overcome these difficulties as a direction for future research. Campbell and Moore <ref> [28] </ref> proposed a method for solving nonlinear, high index problems for which BDF and Implicit RK methods might be inappropriate. <p> Detailed treatment of the applicability of smoothing functions for solving complementarity problems is presented in chapter 6. 3.2.3 Examples Below, we consider three example problems to illustrate the application of formulations (3.9) and (3.13). Example 1: Chemical Reactor Problem Consider the problem described by (3.14) (Campbell and Moore <ref> [28] </ref>, Pantelides [79]). CHAPTER 3. INITIALIZATION AND REINITIALIZATION OF DAES 36 C 0 + C + R = 4 + t + t 2 T 1 + ln (R=C) = 0 (3.14) C = cosh (t 1) The problem is index 3 and has a unique solution. <p> 2 fl 0 = mV R cos fl R g + 2 E cos sin A + E r cos (sin cos A sin fl + cos cos fl) L sin fi + r 2 V R cos fl m h 2 3 = 0 Computations by Campbell and Moore <ref> [28] </ref> using the initial values of the state variables obtained from Brenan et al. [20] found that their values were not exact. Using these values as initial guesses, they generated new initial conditions using a least squares method. <p> There are two points to be noted in this problem: (1) Arbitrary specification of all 7 state variables will lead to problems even if they are slightly inconsistent (as observed by Campbell and Moore <ref> [28] </ref>) since the degrees of freedom is 4. (2) A different undesirable control history of fi &lt; 0 is possible for this problem. fi must be positive in the given set of initial conditions. <p> The initialization problem when formulated using (3.9) and initialized using the values from Brenan et al. [20], returned consistent initial conditions within an accuracy of 10 12 in just 3 iterations. These are identical to the ones presented in Table 5 of Campbell and Moore <ref> [28] </ref>. The SLP method has the added advantage of an easy imposition of a lower bound of zero on fi to avoid the undesirable control history. 2 CHAPTER 3. <p> The two formulations, (3.9) and (3.13), serves this purpose and give the user flexibility to use the available information to the best advantage. Campbell and Moore <ref> [28] </ref> point out that in practical applications, one would expect that some initial values are known and there are reasonable estimates for others.

Reference-contexts: The integration proceeds from that time onwards with the newly activated model. Even though this is the general outline, researchers have adopted different ways of defining their switching functions and using them to detect the time of occurrence of events. Carver <ref> [30] </ref> described a method for detecting and handling discontinuities in functions which form part of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) set. He differentiated the discontinuity functions instead of treating them as algebraic equations and appended them to the original set of ODEs.

Reference-contexts: Here x i may be arbitrarily close to the solution x fl , but a full step may fail to reduce the merit function. A nonmono-tonic line search such as the watchdog technique (Chamberlain et al. <ref> [31] </ref>) or a second order correction (Fletcher [48]) could be used to overcome this effect. 2.3.3 Combination The main difference between line search and trust region methods lies in the sequence in which they use the linear model and enforce the acceptable step length.

Reference-contexts: Property (P5) shows that the residual of the nonlinear complementarity problem is bounded by that of the smooth equation.

Here the max function is approximated using the smoothing function CHAPTER 3. <p> The nonnegativity conditions are implicitly enforced within (6.4), hence no additional procedure as a line search in primal-dual interior point methods described in chapter 6 is required as a consequence. However, the + function is nondifferentiable as it involves the nonsmooth max operator.

SLP ALGORITHM 11 2.1 Introduction Consider the solution of a nonlinear system of equations subject to inequality constraints and variable bounds. h j (x) = 0 x L x x U This problem is termed as the constrained simulation problem (CSP). The citation from <ref> [39] </ref> at the beginning of this chapter would suggest that an effective method to solve (CSP) would have its roots in a Newton's method. <p> This algorithm retained the complexity, O (n 1:5 t), of its feasible counterpart. Under certain conditions the algorithm also possesses a Q-subquadratic convergence. ie. the convergence is Q-order 2 with an unbounded Q factor. For the definitions of these terms, the reader is refered to <ref> [39] </ref>. Tapia et al. [95] studied the Mehrotra predictor-corrector philosophy and demonstrated that it is similar to a level-1 composite Newton philosophy where the corrector step without centering could be viewed as a simplified Newton step.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 2 describes an algorithmic improvement in SLP methods for solving constrained simulation problems. Numerical analysts have traditionally used one of the two major strategies, line search or trust region, for ensuring descent in globally convergent methods for nonlinear equation solving or optimization <ref> [40] </ref>. In this work, we present a new descent strategy combining both line search and trust region methods in the context of SLP. <p> CHAPTER 2. SLP ALGORITHM 13 In the next section, to improve the performance of this method, we incorporate a new descent strategy into this algorithm. The new strategy combines two major classes of strategies used to ensure descent: line search and trust region methods. Dennis and Schnabel <ref> [40] </ref> and Fletcher [48] provide a detailed study of these methods. 2.3 A New Descent Strategy 2.3.1 Line Search Methods The basic concept behind using line search methods is to choose a descent direction d i from the current point x i and select an acceptable point x i+1 in this

Reference-contexts: The equation based formulations presented in the previous section will be used to model phase equilibrium for each tray. The complementarity conditions are smoothed using the interior point smoothing function (6.16). The distillation column models are formulated in GAMS [22] and solved using CONOPT <ref> [42] </ref> using the modified framework described in section 6.2.3. Modified framework was chosen because of its ease of implementation within GAMS. A three phase flash example is also described. The computational time reported for all the examples are on an HP 9000/700. CHAPTER 6.

Reference-contexts: Most of the current implementations increase or decrease the trust region by comparing the actual reduction in the merit function and the predicted reduction on linearization. The closer their ratio is to unity, the better the agreement. Duff et al. <ref> [43] </ref> describe this strategy in the context of using linear programs to solve sparse nonlinear equations. Since the merit function is nondifferentiable, it is possible for the Maratos effect to occur in both line search and trust region methods (Fletcher [48]).

Reference-contexts: Today, chemical industries perform process modeling, design, synthesis, analysis, simulation and optimization as integral part of their day to day activities. Research activity in process systems engineering is influenced heavily and often driven by the following two factors (Evans <ref> [45] </ref>) * Demands of the industry and society * Advances in computer hardware technology In view of the global economy, increased safety concerns and strict environmental regulations, demands from the industry for better concepts, ideas and tools from the process systems engineering community is higher than ever. <p> The first process simulator was developed about forty years ago and since then simulation technology has advanced by leaps and bounds that, today, no major chemical or petrochemical plant would be built without first simulating the process on the computer <ref> [45] </ref>. Process simulation has many benefits, among them being ecomomic experimentation, evaluation of alternate policies, experimental replication, test of parameter sensitivity and study of system safety and stability [59].

Reference-contexts: Process simulation has many benefits, among them being ecomomic experimentation, evaluation of alternate policies, experimental replication, test of parameter sensitivity and study of system safety and stability [59]. Steady state simulation is part and parcel of chemical engineering process design and analysis. Biegler [15] and Evans <ref> [46] </ref> provide a review of the state of the art in steady state process simulation. Equation oriented steady state simulators, as opposed to their sequential modular counterparts, rely on an equation solving engine which must be able to handle poor starting points, inequality constraints, singularities and ill-conditioning, among others.

Reference-contexts: SLP ALGORITHM 13 In the next section, to improve the performance of this method, we incorporate a new descent strategy into this algorithm. The new strategy combines two major classes of strategies used to ensure descent: line search and trust region methods. Dennis and Schnabel [40] and Fletcher <ref> [48] </ref> provide a detailed study of these methods. 2.3 A New Descent Strategy 2.3.1 Line Search Methods The basic concept behind using line search methods is to choose a descent direction d i from the current point x i and select an acceptable point x i+1 in this direction at which <p> Duff et al. [43] describe this strategy in the context of using linear programs to solve sparse nonlinear equations. Since the merit function is nondifferentiable, it is possible for the Maratos effect to occur in both line search and trust region methods (Fletcher <ref> [48] </ref>). Here x i may be arbitrarily close to the solution x fl , but a full step may fail to reduce the merit function. A nonmono-tonic line search such as the watchdog technique (Chamberlain et al.

The resulting set of ODEs is then integrated using Gear's method <ref> [49] </ref> with Nordsieck step size control [78]. This procedure maintains a Nordsieck polynomial of order q (q &lt; 5) for all the variables including the ones describing the switching functions.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm detects in the first phase, the switching function whose zero crossing determines the earliest state event. The polynomial approximations are obtained directly from the BDF method (Gear <ref> [50] </ref>) used to solve the DAEs. The second phase carries out the simultaneous determination of the state event location and reinitialization. The above representative algorithms in literature have their own 'pro's and 'con's. Below, we look at those with respect to the some of the important issues in this problem.

Reference-contexts: Unger et al. [97] also present an algorithm based on structural analysis. They determine the structural rank and the structural index of the problem by using a structural version CHAPTER 3. INITIALIZATION AND REINITIALIZATION OF DAES 28 of the symbolic algorithm for index reduction by Gear <ref> [51] </ref>. Gear's algorithm can be viewed as an extension of the algorithm by Bachmann et al. [5] for linear systems. Here the structural rank and index of the DAE (3.1) is solely determined by the patterns of @F=@v 0 and @F=@v. <p> Note that the second case corresponds to the commonly used steady state initial condition specifications. 2 Example 2: Pendulum Problem This is the popular pendulum problem considered by various authors (Pantelides [79], Gear <ref> [51] </ref> Unger et al. [97]). The formulation is given by (3.15). x 0 = v v 0 = T x (3.15) x 2 + y 2 = 1 The problem is of index 3 and has 2 degrees of freedom for specification of initial conditions. <p> Hence, the assumption of continuity of differential variables across the discontinuity, often used in dynamic simulators, is not always true. An underlying ODE can be determined, locally, using a symbolic algorithm, for example by Gear <ref> [51] </ref>. However, the form of the ODE found depends on the algebraic manipulation CHAPTER 3.

Reference-contexts: The classical sequential modular approaches first determine the number and nature of the phases present at equilibrium and then solve the corresponding set of equations. Such a procedure based approach is not viable in the larger context of an equation oriented environment. In chapter 4 and in <ref> [53] </ref>, we addressed this problem for multiphase systems using an optimization formulation. The key idea used in the formulation (4.24) is that if two phases do not coexist at equilibrium, then the corresponding equilibrium expression could be relaxed.

Reference-contexts: The fact that none of the points on the Gibbs energy surface should lie below the tangent plane at the solution, in principle, points to infinite number of constraints. Thus, an alternate way to incorporate the tangent plane criteria could be through semi-infinite programming <ref> [58] </ref>. Semi-infinite programming considers optimization problems with finite number of variables and infinite number of constraints. However, this problem is challenging, because of the nonlinear nature of the constraints encountered in phase equilibrium calculations. Development of methods based on semi-infinite programming could be explored in the future. 143

Reference-contexts: In the remainder of this section, we see that SLP-based methods can aid in event detection and resolution. 4.3.1 Existing Methods According to Marquardt [69], the state of the art in dynamic simulation with discontinuities are the so-called discontinuity locking and switching functions (Joglekar and Reklaitis <ref> [60] </ref>, Pantelides [80], Smith and Morton [90]). When integration is carried out, the model is locked in one continuous case and no discontinuity is allowed. This avoids problems which might occur while integrating across discontinuities, either side of which are described by different models. <p> If any are present, the time at which the discontinuity occurs is determined by solving the polynomial approximation of the switching functions within that interval. In their description of BOSS, a simulator for batch and semi-continuous processes, Joglekar and Reklaitis <ref> [60] </ref> did not append the switching function to the original set of DAEs describing the process. The q-th order polynomial approximation for each variable which is obtained from the solution of the DAE is used to construct the polynomial for the switching functions. <p> Detection The first step in the treatment of discontinuities is their 'detection'. A broad spectrum of algorithms base the detection of discontinuities on the signs of the switching functions and their derivatives at the boundaries of the interval (example Joglekar and Reklaitis <ref> [60] </ref>). Such a procedure can fail to detect multiple zero crossings of the switching function within that interval. The same applies to methods which check for the logical condition at the end of each integration step (Pantelides [80]). For example consider the pressure profile CHAPTER 4. <p> Nonexistence of solution across the discontinuity could cause presently used discontinuity locking methods to fail (Joglekar and Reklaitis <ref> [60] </ref>, Pantelides and Barton [81]). The LP based approach, however, has the advantage of having a penalty function in (2.2) to allow constraint relaxation if solutions do not exist.

The 1990s have seen the emergence of primal dual methods as an important class of interior point algorithms from a computational as well as a theoretical standpoint.

An interpertation of the predictor-corrector methods using rSQP allows us to take a fresh look at their theoretical properties from a different persperctive from that of the global and superlinear convergence properties developed for rSQP over the years.

Reference-contexts: INITIALIZATION AND REINITIALIZATION OF DAES 29 form. Chung and Westerberg [35] and Chung [34] proposed a numerical algorithm for consistent initialization by identifying singular subsets of equations from the Jacobian and symbolically differentiating them. Majer et al. <ref> [67] </ref> consider the problem of reinitialization of DAEs after discontinuities which we also discuss in detail in section 3.3. <p> The reason is that the reinitialization problem involves an additional exercise of determining the variables which are continuous across a discontinuity. The numerical values of the continuous variables at the point of discontinuity contribute to the specifications for the reinitialization problem. Majer et al. <ref> [67] </ref> address the problem of reinitialization of DAEs after discontinuities. They specifically look at index one linear-implicit DAEs of the form (3.18), where there are discontinuous steps in the forcing function u. <p> Often it is assumed that the differential variables are continuous if the composition of the differential variables appearing in the describing equations remain unchanged across the discontinuity. This is not always true as was shown by Majer et al. <ref> [67] </ref> and Brull and Pallaske [23] for fully implicit index one systems. <p> As in Majer et al. <ref> [67] </ref>, v + i + t (k) The derivatives of u are not bounded for step changes in u. The integral will vanish only when the derivatives of u do not form part of the integral, explicitly or implicitly through the variables appearing in the underlying ODE. <p> A similar result is obtained from the sensitivity analysis (3.33). 2 Example 7 Consider the DAE (3.47) for which the continuity assumption is valid. This problem was considered previously by Majer et al. <ref> [67] </ref>. x 0 = y 1 1 1 + u (3.47) 1=3 1=2 Consider the solution of the reinitialization problem of (3.47). The problem has a steady state solution of y 1 = 1, y 2 = 4 and x = 3 for u = 0. <p> This is probably the most logical initial guess to be chosen when carrying out dynamic simulation of the above system. The second set is the initial guess used by Majer et al. <ref> [67] </ref> for the solution of the problem. They point out that (3.47) cannot be solved by Newton's method from this set of initial guesses because of the limited region of convergence. They use a more expensive continuation method for the solution of the problem.

Reference-contexts: Interior point methods, first introduced by Karmarkar [62] for linear programming problems in 1984, has polynomial complexity and is preferred for solving large scale LP problems. We consider a class of primal-dual interior point methods, a Mehrotra predictor-corrector method <ref> [72] </ref>, for our study. We also provide a novel interpretation of predictor-corrector methods using reduced Hessian SQP (rSQP). Incorporation of interior point methods within an SQP framework, which we henceforth call Interior point SQP (ISQP), is demonstrated to overcome the combinatorial complexity associated with active set methods. <p> However, it is especially advantageous when applied to CHAPTER 5. INTERIOR POINT METHODS 91 SQP strategies that exploit the structure of the optimality conditions (without inequality constraints). To develop this approach, we incorporate the characteristics of the well studied Mehro-tra <ref> [72] </ref> predictor-corrector method, which is a path following algorithm within an SQP framework for the solution of nonlinear programming problems. The method could be used in a full space or reduced space for solving large QP problems. <p> We would like to integrate the interior point method and SQP in such a way that we still retain fast linear performance as well as the structured decomposition. To develop this approach, we apply certain characteristics of the well studied Mehrotra <ref> [72] </ref> predictor-corrector algorithm. The predictor-corrector algorithm solves the system of equations (5.14) iteratively. <p> We will henceforth refer to this framework as ISQP. In the next section we consider some example problems. 5.4 Examples 5.4.1 Linear Programming Problems A comparison of this approach to that of Mehrotra <ref> [72] </ref> for the solution of Linear Programs would be of interest. Mehrotra's approach is two-pronged as explained in the previous section. It does not consider the centering term k e in the predictor step. <p> Under certain assumptions, including that of monotonicity, they established polynomial complexity bounds for two variants of the predictor-corrector algorithm. The first algorithm, similar to the one Mehrotra <ref> [72] </ref> proposed, has a worst-case complexity bound of O (n 3 t) iterations for reducing the residuals by a factor of 2 t for t &gt; 1. <p> Chapter 5 describes incorporation of the concepts of interior point methods within a nonlinear programming framework, particularly SQP. We considered a class of primal-dual interior point methods, a Mehrotra predictor-corrector method <ref> [72] </ref>, for our study. An intuitive interpretation of the predictor corrector interior point methods using reduced Hessian SQP has been derived. A framework for the adaptation of a path following primal dual interior point method with an SQP approach, ISQP, has been also been developed.

Reference-contexts: NONSMOOTH DYNAMIC SIMULATION 79 rium calculations, especially in an equation oriented simulation environment, is that the number of phases is not known a priori. Among the different approaches suggested to tackle this problem, the classical sequential modular approach is the most familiar one (Boston and Britt [19], Nelson <ref> [77] </ref>). In general, these methods calculate the bubble and dew points ( in the case of two phase calculations) and then determine the number of phases at equilibrium. The set of equations applicable to that particular phase behavior is then solved.

Reference-contexts: He differentiated the discontinuity functions instead of treating them as algebraic equations and appended them to the original set of ODEs. The resulting set of ODEs is then integrated using Gear's method [49] with Nordsieck step size control <ref> [78] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These hidden algebraic equations in (3.1) impose constraints on the initial conditions of variables which can be specified independently. Thus the consistent initialization problem requires identification of these constraints, implicitly or explicitly, and their treatment along with the original set of equations. Pantelides <ref> [79] </ref> utilizes the property that the hidden or latent equations are generated from those subsets of equations in which the number of variables (x 0 ; y) present in the subset is less than the number of equations in the subset. <p> Example 1: Chemical Reactor Problem Consider the problem described by (3.14) (Campbell and Moore [28], Pantelides <ref> [79] </ref>).

[97]). The formulation is given by (3.15). x 0 = v v 0 = T x (3.15) x 2 + y 2 = 1 The problem is of index 3 and has 2 degrees of freedom for specification of initial conditions.

Reference-contexts: In the remainder of this section, we see that SLP-based methods can aid in event detection and resolution. 4.3.1 Existing Methods According to Marquardt [69], the state of the art in dynamic simulation with discontinuities are the so-called discontinuity locking and switching functions (Joglekar and Reklaitis [60], Pantelides <ref> [80] </ref>, Smith and Morton [90]). When integration is carried out, the model is locked in one continuous case and no discontinuity is allowed. This avoids problems which might occur while integrating across discontinuities, either side of which are described by different models. <p> As described before the signs of the functions are used to detect and the polynomial approximation is then solved to locate any event. This method however suffers from loss of accuracy when the switching functions are nonlinear. Pantelides <ref> [80] </ref> does not use discontinuity functions in SpeedUp. The logical conditions are checked at the end of each integration step. If they are triggered at the end of the step, a bisection method is used to locate the state event time. <p> Such a procedure can fail to detect multiple zero crossings of the switching function within that interval. The same applies to methods which check for the logical condition at the end of each integration step (Pantelides <ref> [80] </ref>). For example consider the pressure profile CHAPTER 4. NONSMOOTH DYNAMIC SIMULATION 66 in a pressure vessel system given in figure 4.2. <p> However, this is not the only problem which is encountered in the detection phase. When multiple zero crossings of the switching function occurs, a wrong state event could be detected as occurring first. Consider a bisection method (Pantelides <ref> [80] </ref>) applied to the profile in 4.3. A discontinuity is detected upon checking the signs of the switching function at t k and t k+1 . The method then checks the sign of the function at t.

Reference-contexts: CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 3 Of increasing interest in the simulation community is the development of efficient dynamic simulation tools. Many authors have surveyed the present and future applications of dynamic simulation tools in chemical process industries (Perkins [84], Marquardt [69], Naess et al. [76], Pantelides and Barton <ref> [81] </ref>). Marquardt [69] points out that most of the current dynamic simulation packages are developed to solve models of predominantly continuous nature. However, few industrial processes could be considered to operate in a truly continuous manner. <p> Such criteria have not been reported in the literature for problems of general index. The popular assumption of continuity of all differential variables across a discontinuity (Pantelides and Barton <ref> [81] </ref>) is shown to be not necessarily valid. The continuous set of variables is determined by performing an LP sensitivity analysis on the derivative array equations. The applications of the ideas outlined in these sections have been demonstrated on small problems, of low and high index. <p> Nonexistence of solution across the discontinuity could cause presently used discontinuity locking methods to fail (Joglekar and Reklaitis [60], Pantelides and Barton <ref> [81] </ref>). The LP based approach, however, has the advantage of having a penalty function in (2.2) to allow constraint relaxation if solutions do not exist. In this case, the algorithm will converge to a pseudosolution, and we can use this information to confirm that we have crossed a discontinuity. <p> On the other hand, the current state of the system described by a history dependent discontinuity is dependent on the prior states. They are tougher to solve when compared to their history independent counterparts. As with current dynamic simulators, (see Pantelides and Barton <ref> [81] </ref>), we introduce an integer flag to represent this memory component. For illustration, let us consider an CHAPTER 4. <p> Reinitializa-tion after a discontinuity is an even tougher problem as it involves the additional exercise of determining the subset of variables which are continuous across a discontinuity. The popular assumption used in practice today is that of continuity of all differential variables across a discontinuous input (Pantelides and Barton <ref> [81] </ref>). In chapter 3 we presented a criterion for checking the validity of the assumption of continuity of differential variables across a discontinuity caused by a step change in the input variables.

Reference-contexts: Pantelides [80] does not use discontinuity functions in SpeedUp. The logical conditions are checked at the end of each integration step. If they are triggered at the end of the step, a bisection method is used to locate the state event time. Park and Barton <ref> [82] </ref> proposed a two-phase strategy for the detection and location of state events. They argue that state event location requires simultaneous determination of a state event time and initial conditions for the DAE in the next time interval. <p> The earliest of such roots determined is identified as the offending discontinuity. Most of these methods have been implemented in conjunction with the polynomial interpolation formulae generated by the Backward Difference Formula (BDF) methods employed to solve the DAEs themselves. Park and Barton <ref> [82] </ref> describes a Gear's method with Nordsieck step size control. Roots of the switching function (s) within an CHAPTER 4. NONSMOOTH DYNAMIC SIMULATION 67 interval are detected using an elegant method based on interval analysis. <p> In view of the above, appending the switching functions to the DAEs is definitely a better option. However, the integration of the augmented system may require more integration steps as the functional characteristics of the switching functions may limit the step size <ref> [82] </ref>. However, the following needs to CHAPTER 4. NONSMOOTH DYNAMIC SIMULATION 68 be considered in such an implementation. (b) Discontinuities encountered one after the other In some problems it is likely that discontinuities are encountered one after the other in very short time intervals. <p> The lower order polynomial approximations of the switching functions may no longer be accurate enough to determine the exact time of occurence of a discontinuity, for problems encountering frequent discontinuities. (c) Isolation of the earliest event <ref> [82] </ref> utilizes the polynomial approximation of the discontinuity functions to determine the earliest event and isolates that particular event for the determination of the state event time. The question which arises in this context is whether one can isolate an event as occurring first with absolute certainty or not. <p> Almost all of the present methods perform the reinitialization step independently after an event has been located. <ref> [82] </ref> identified a phenomena called discontinuity sticking (figure 4.5) which occur with these methods. In most of the current methods, reinitialization is based on the assumption of continuity of the differential variables across the discontinuity, which we have showed in chapter 2 as not necessarily true. <p> Else 6.

Step 3 uses the same tolerance as in <ref> [82] </ref> and eliminates the problem of discontinuity sticking. Solving the problem at the point of discontinuity (step 4) helps to locate it accurately.

Reference-contexts: First, we briefly summarize the theoretical properties of the Mehrotra predictor-corrector class of methods currently reported in the literature. The great success of Mehrotra's approach in practice has triggered intense theoretical research for understanding its convergence properties, particularly the computational complexity, in the past five years <ref> [95] </ref>, [105], [104], [102]. Zhang and Zhang [105] studied the theoretical convergence properties of Mehrotra's algorithm on the horizontal linear complementarity problem of which the LP and QP are special cases. Under certain assumptions, including that of monotonicity, they established polynomial complexity bounds for two variants of the predictor-corrector algorithm. <p> This algorithm retained the complexity, O (n 1:5 t), of its feasible counterpart. Under certain conditions the algorithm also possesses a Q-subquadratic convergence. ie. the convergence is Q-order 2 with an unbounded Q factor. For the definitions of these terms, the reader is refered to [39].

Current research is geared towards showing superlinear convergence properties when these assumptions are relaxed. It should also be mentioned that subquadratic convergence has also been established for affine scaling algorithms which do not use a corrector step [73].

However, one hurdle in exploiting the problem structure is an efficient strategy for treating inequality constraints in the QP subproblem. <p> One such problem class is multiperiod design optimization. <ref> [98] </ref> described a decomposition strategy for multiperiod problems where the computational effort is linear to the number of periods. However, the QP subproblem in the subspace of the design variables at each iteration is solved using an active set strategy.

Ax = b x i s i = 0 The monograph by Wright <ref> [100] </ref> gives an excellent description of primal- dual interior point methods. <p> INTERIOR POINT METHODS 103 5.5 Theoretical Properties Most interior point codes developed in the 1990s have been based on Mehrotra's predictor corrector algorithm. Several variants of this algorithm have been implemented, all quite similar in principle, each differing slightly in the heuristics developed from a decade of computational experience <ref> [100] </ref>. An intruiging aspect of this class of methods is that they outperform most of the other codes in practice [66], and not every aspect of it has been explained theoretically. <p> Incorporation of SLP methods will make the treatment of the initialization and reinitialization problems easier and more user-friendly within these solvers. Such an interface could be implemented in the future. Interior Point Methods * As Wright <ref> [100] </ref> points out, a successful piece of optimization software requires more than just a good optimization algorithm. Efficiency and stability of the linear algebra are important ingredients.

Reference-contexts: First, we briefly summarize the theoretical properties of the Mehrotra predictor-corrector class of methods currently reported in the literature. The great success of Mehrotra's approach in practice has triggered intense theoretical research for understanding its convergence properties, particularly the computational complexity, in the past five years [95], [105], [104], <ref> [102] </ref>. Zhang and Zhang [105] studied the theoretical convergence properties of Mehrotra's algorithm on the horizontal linear complementarity problem of which the LP and QP are special cases. Under certain assumptions, including that of monotonicity, they established polynomial complexity bounds for two variants of the predictor-corrector algorithm. <p> It should be noted that this approach of the centering term in the predictor is, in fact, very similar to the combined range and null space steps in the ISQP framework described in section 5.3.
