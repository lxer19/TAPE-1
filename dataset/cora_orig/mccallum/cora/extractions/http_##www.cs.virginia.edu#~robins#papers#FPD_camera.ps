Abstract: We explore physical layout for a three-dimensional (3D) FPGA architecture. For placement, we introduce a top-down partitioning technique based on rectilinear Steiner trees; we then employ a one-step router to produce the final layout. Experimental results indicate that our approach produces effective 3D layouts, using considerably shorter average interconnect distance than is achievable with conventional 2D FPGA's of comparable size.

Reference-contexts: More recent FPGA architectures [27] strive to increase usable-gate-counts by reducing the number of programmable switches. Three-dimensional VLSI has recently begun to attract increased attention. The implications of three-dimensional abutment of individual transistors has been studied in [16]. Issues in vertical integration have been investigated in <ref> [1] </ref>, with a focus on "silicon-on-insulator" techniques. In order to reduce delay between individual FPGAs, [11] proposed adding a surrounding programmable interconnection frame to individual die, using an MCM substrate for interconnections between frames. An alternative approach investigates the use of optical interconnect to construct multi-layered FPGAs [10].

Reference-contexts: During customization, configuration data is downloaded onto an FPGA, specifying which programmable switches are to be made active (i.e., programmed "ON"). This process causes each net (i.e., a set of logic-block input/output pins) to be properly interconnected. Our 3D FPGA architecture <ref> [2] </ref> is a generalization of the basic 2D model, in which each switch block has six immediate neighbors (Figure 2 (a)), as opposed to four in 2D.

Reference-contexts: O (n 1 2D) implies shorter signal propagation delays. In order to realize such potential benefits, we must develop effective physical-design techniques which exploit these properties. The physical design tools we developed for 3D FPGAs build on those proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>, and adapt these technique for the new architecture. <p> Since the quality of the results of any one phase depends on results from earlier phases, it is beneficial for each phase to consider its effects on subsequent phases. A placement technique called Mondrian was designed to specifically consider the effects of placement on routing for 2D FPGAs <ref> [4] </ref> [13]. Here we generalize this method to three dimensions. Our 3D FPGA placement algorithm uses a recursive geometric technique called thumbnail partitioning, which decomposes the FPGA area into an m fi n fi r grid.

Reference-contexts: The IKMB method is formally described in Figure 7. The IKMB algorithm mirrors the Iterated 1-Steiner method [15] [18] and is quite effective in reducing total interconnect length for 2D FPGAs <ref> [5] </ref>. Our experimental results indicate that IKMB is also effective for 3D FPGAs (see Section 6). Figure 8 shows how introducing Steiner points into the routing solution can reduce total interconnect length.

Reference-contexts: Each such switch block is conceptually added as a new "virtual" pin in the net. The portion of each net within each region of the partitioning template is then passed on to a lower level of the recursion (this is akin to the virtual terminal <ref> [6] </ref> and terminal propagation [12] techniques). Assignments are made using a minimum-bipartite-matching heuristic, where one set of nodes represent all nets crossing a cut-line, and the other node set represents the switch boxes on that cut-line. The recursion terminates when a region contains at most one logic block.

Reference-contexts: The three-dimensional FPGA model poses a number of new challenges in the area of heat dissipation. Higher operating temperatures can lead to less reliable operation (e.g., heat stress can induce faults). A number of MCM thermal-dissipation techniques (e.g., thermal bumps and pillars [9], thermal gels <ref> [7] </ref>, etc.) may also be applicable to 3D FPGAs. Chip-size packages [23, 28] are a relatively new packaging technology which results in a package typically only 10% larger than the bare die itself.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a flexible and reusable design alternative to custom integrated circuits. Using FPGAs, digital designs can be quickly implemented and emulated in hardware, which enables a faster, more economical design cycle <ref> [8] </ref>. The flexible logic and connection resources of FPGAs allow different designs to be implemented on the same hardware. However, this versatility comes at the expense of a substantial performance penalty due primarily to signal delay through the programmable routing switches. <p> The basic 2D FPGA architecture consists of a symmetrical array of user-configurable logic blocks. Running through the channels between the rows and columns of logic blocks is a network of channel segments, linked together by programmable switch blocks <ref> [8] </ref> (Figure 1). During customization, configuration data is downloaded onto an FPGA, specifying which programmable switches are to be made active (i.e., programmed "ON"). This process causes each net (i.e., a set of logic-block input/output pins) to be properly interconnected.

Next, every edge in each thumbnail must be assigned to a specific switch block along the crossed cut-line of the partitioning template.

Reference-contexts: A second motivation for using chip-sized packages rather than bare dies is the known-good-die problem: compared to packaged die, testing of bare dies is costly as well as time-consuming. Chip-size packages, which are essentially testable dies, can dramatically reduce this problem <ref> [14] </ref>. 3 Reducing Interconnect Length In this section, we explore analytically both the expected interconnect length and the required number of programmable switches. Channel segments on an FPGA are linked together with programmable switches.
