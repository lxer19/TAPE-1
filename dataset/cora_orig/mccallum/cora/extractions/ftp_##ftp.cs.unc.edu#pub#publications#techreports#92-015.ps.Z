Abstract: 1.1 New Collaboration: Real-time Display and Control of STM. The most exciting news is that we have entered into a collaboration with Professor Stanley Williams of the UCLA Department of Chemistry to develop a real-time graphic interface for scanning tunneling microscopes, atomic force microscopes, etc. Prof. Williams and his group have developed ultrastable STM's that operate with a drift on the order of 1 per minute, at room temperature, in atmosphere. This stability means that interactive viewing of the scanned surface makes sense. Since successive scans are not widely displaced, the drift can in principle be compensated for, so that the scanned surface can be treated as a virtual world for viewing, and for manipulation. Our approach is to provide the user with a head-mounted display, flying and viewing controls, and head position sensing, so that he can scale himself down to near-atomic scale and see the surface features as if he were walking or flying over it. We can use our GROPE force display arm to allow the user to probe the surface shape, feeling the shape as well as seeing it. Prof. Williams believes that suitable voltage pulse controls will enable a user to pick up and put down small chunks of atoms. We aim to use our viewing apparatus and our manipulator arm to control this process, so as to create a nanomanipulator. 1.2 Progress. Prof. Williams has built two STM's, so he agreed to install one in our laboratory for a trial period. UCLA graduate research assistant Eric Snyder came to Chapel Hill with a microscope in January, 1992, and by the end of his tenday visit, it was up and running, yielding pictures of barely atomic resolution. Previously UNC graduate research assistant Russ Taylor had written the necessary software, journeyed to UCLA, installed his software on their machine, and convinced himself and Snyder that it could view and control the STM. Initially Taylor and Snyder operated the STM in imaging mode, gathering data by scanning the sample (initially freshly cleaved graphite and ion bombarded graphite), reconstructing the landscape, and allowing interactive viewing of it. More recently Taylor has implemented a probe mode in which an operator uses our manipulator ARM to position a cursor over the image of the surface he is studying. Thus, in this mode two axes of the ARM are used for input. The system controls the position of the ARM along the third axis to correspond to the local height of the surface. Using this mode the operator can "feel" the contours of the surface. This mode works both with data collected from a previously scanned surface and for real-time investigation of a real surface. In the latter case, the ARM is controlling the x and y coordinates of the STM tip, the servo mechanism of the STM is causing the tip to track the sample surface, and the system is controlling the third axis of the ARM to represent the local height of the sample. Since installation, Taylor and Mr. Vern Chi of the UNC CS Microelectronic Systems Laboratory have upgraded the STM to provide a stepping motor to bring the tip into tunneling distance from the surface. Even though Snyder trained Taylor in STM operation, the tip distancing proved to be not only tedious but quite exacting, and broken tips were not uncommon. The motor drive makes tip distancing simple and rapid.
