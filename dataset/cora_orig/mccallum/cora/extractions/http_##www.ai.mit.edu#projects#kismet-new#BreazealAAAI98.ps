Abstract: This paper presents a motivational system for an autonomous robot which is designed to regulate human-robot interaction. The mode of social interaction is that of a caretaker-infant dyad where a human acts as the caretaker for the robot. An infant's emotions and drives play a very important role in generating meaningful interactions with the caretaker, and regulating these interactions to maintain an environment suitable for the learning process (Bullowa 1979). Similarly, the learning task for the robot is to apply various communication skills acquired during social exchanges to manipulate the caretaker such that its drives are satisfied. Toward this goal, the motivational system implements drives, emotions, and facial expressions. Although the details of the learning itself are beyond the scope of this paper, this work represents an important step toward realizing robots that can engage in meaningful bi-directional social interactions with humans.

Reference-contexts: Introduction We want to build robots that engage in meaningful social exchanges with humans. In contrast to current work in robotics that focus on robot-robot interactions <ref> (Billard & Dautenhahn 1997) </ref>, this work concentrates on human-robot interactions. By doing so, it is possible to have a socially sophisticated human assist the robot in acquiring more sophicticated communication skills and help it learn the meaning these acts have for others.

Reference-contexts: The organization and operation of this framework is heavily influenced by concepts from psychology, ethology, and developmental psychology.

For this implementation, the basic computational process is modeled as a transducer.

Reference-contexts: The context for learning involves social exchanges where the robot learns how to manipulate the caretaker into satisfying its internal drives. An infant's emotions and drives play an important role in generating meaningful interactions with the caretaker <ref> (Bullowa 1979) </ref>. These interactions constitute learning episodes for new communication behaviors. In particular, the infant is strongly biased to learn communication skills that result in having the caretaker satisfy the infant's drives (Halliday 1975). <p> A similar behavior is observed in infants. When they are in extreme distress, perhaps throwing a tantrum, they may fall into a disturbed sleep. This is a self regulation tactic they use in extreme cases <ref> (Bullowa 1979) </ref>. Three of the four consummatory behaviors cannot be activated by the intensity of the drive alone. Instead, they require a special sort of environmental interaction to become active. For instance, Play with People cannot become active without the participa tion of a person.

Reference-contexts: Many experiments in developmental psychology have shown that infants show suprise when witnessing an unexpected or novel outcome to a familiar event <ref> (Carey & Gelman 1991) </ref>. Furthermore, parents use their infant's display of excitement or interest as cues to regulate their interaction with them (Wood, Bruner & Ross 1976). In humans, four factors serve to elicit emotions, i.e. neurochemical, sensorimotor, motivational, and cognitive (Izard 1993).

Reference-contexts: The emotions also play an important role in learning during face to face exchanges with the caretaker, but we leave the details of this to another paper. The organization and operation of the emotion subsystem is strongly inspired by various theories of emotions in humans <ref> (Ekman & Davidson 1994) </ref>, (Izard 1993), and most closely resembles the framework presented in (Velasquez 1996). The robot has several emotion processes. Although they are quite different from emotions in humans, they are designed to be rough analogs | especially with respect to the accompanying facial expressions.

In particular, the infant is strongly biased to learn communication skills that result in having the caretaker satisfy the infant's drives <ref> (Halliday 1975) </ref>. The infant's emotional responses provide important cues which the caretaker uses to assess how to satiate the infant's drives, and how to carefully regulate the complexity of the interaction.

Reference-contexts: Third, they provide a learning context the robot learns skills that serve to satisfy its drives. The design of the robot's drive subsystem is heavily inspired by ethological views <ref> (Lorenz 1973) </ref>, (Tin-bergen 1951). One distinguishing feature of drives is their temporally cyclic behavior. That is, given no stimulation, a drive will tend to increase in intensity unless it is satiated. For instance, an animal's hunger level or need to sleep follows a cyclical pattern.

Reference-contexts: The organization and operation of this framework is heavily influenced by concepts from psychology, ethology, and developmental psychology. Computational Substrate: The overall system is implemented as an agent-based architecture similar to that of (Blumberg 1996) and <ref> (Maes 1990) </ref>. For this implementation, the basic computational process is modeled as a transducer. Its activation energy x is computed by the equation: x = ( P j=1 teger values of inputs i j , weights w j , bias b where n is the number of inputs. <p> The process is active when its activation level exceeds an activation threshold. When active, the process may perform some special computation, send output messages to connected processes, spread some of its activation energy to connected units <ref> (Maes 1990) </ref>, and/or express itself through behavior. Each drive, emotion, behavior, percept, and motor skill are modeled as a separate transducer process specifically tailored for its role in the overall system architecture. Details are presented in the following section. Drives: The robot's drives serve three purposes.

The overall framework of the emotion system shares strong commonality with that of intensities of human interaction. This figure corresponds to a short period of overly intense human interaction. <ref> (Velasquez 1996) </ref>, although its function is specifically targeted for social exchanges and learning. Of the robot's emotions, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness are analogs of the primary emotions in humans.
