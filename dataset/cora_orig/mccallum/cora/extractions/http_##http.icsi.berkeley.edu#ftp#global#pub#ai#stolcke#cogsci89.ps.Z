Title: Processing Unification-based Grammars in a Connectionist Framework  
Author: Andreas Stolcke 
Address: Berkeley, California  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of California, Berkeley and International Computer Science Institute  
Abstract: We present an approach to the processing of unification-based grammars in the connectionist paradigm. The method involves two basic steps: (1) Translation of a grammar's rules into a set of structure fragments, and (2) encoding these fragments in a connectionist network such that unification and rule application can take place by spreading activation. Feature structures are used to constrain sentence generation by semantic and/or grammatical properties. The method incorporates a general model of unification in connectionist networks.

Reference-contexts: A fundamental feature of natural language neglected in our model is time-sequentiality. Although considerable parallelism is probably essential for natural language processing, sequentiality is still inherent in priming effects on sequencing and other psycholinguistic phenomena <ref> (Bock, 1982) </ref>. As a first step in this direction, activation flow (progressing unifications) could be modified so as to follow a left-to-right pattern. Early segments would be generated first, thereafter constraining what follows in the sentence.

Reference-contexts: For technical reasons, inhibitory x-links cause activation in t-units to be mutually exclusive, thus preventing stable coalitions <ref> (Feldman & Ballard, 1982) </ref> of u/nu-units. Unification by spreading activation We will now describe the link structure which forces node equivalence (represented by u/nu-units) to conform to the given set of f-structure edges (represented by e-units) and the definition of unification.

Reference-contexts: There exist standard techniques to `escape' such local minima <ref> (Hinton & Sejnowski, 1986) </ref>, but they do not apply to networks with asymmetric links such as ours. A less serious shortcoming of the current model involves recursive rule applications.

Reference-contexts: A different perspective on this problem might indicate a way to its solution. Rule applications from which the system has to backtrack eventually, roughly correspond to local minima in the energy function generally used to describe and analyze the dynamics of connectionst systems <ref> (Hopfield, 1982) </ref>, whereas the set of unifications resulting in a complete sentence should constitute a global energy minimum. There exist standard techniques to `escape' such local minima (Hinton & Sejnowski, 1986), but they do not apply to networks with asymmetric links such as ours.

Reference-contexts: All the units in the implementation will be simple linear threshold units operating with activations of either 0 or 1. This representational scheme is essentially a localized version of the encoding of S-expressions in BoltzCONS <ref> (Touretzky1986) </ref>. E-units can be visualized as residing in a 3-dimensional space, with two `node' dimensions and one `feature' dimension. Representing Unifications Unification of f-structures can be viewed as a merging of DAG nodes. For example, consider the structures representing rules (R S ) and (R VP ) in Figure 3.
