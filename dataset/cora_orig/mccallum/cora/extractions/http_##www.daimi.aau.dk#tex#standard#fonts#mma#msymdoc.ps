The virtual fonts where created with Alan Jeffrey's fontinst package <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 Files and Installation To use the fonts an DVI-driver that understands virtual fonts like dvips is needed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction comes with a full set of mathematical fonts in PostScript format. These fonts can be used to typeset mathematical texts together with the standard PostScript font, Times-Roman.

T E X must be informed about the dimensions of the characters and, for typesetting mathematics, T E X needs the information on how to change the sizes of the operators and delimiters coded in the fonts [3].
