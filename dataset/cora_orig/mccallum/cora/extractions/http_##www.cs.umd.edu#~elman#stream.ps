Abstract: We consider the design of robust and accurate finite element approximation methods for solving convection-diffusion problems. We develop some two-parameter streamline diffusion schemes with piecewise bilinear (or linear) trial functions and show that these schemes satisfy the necessary conditions for L 2 -uniform convergence of order greater than 1=2 introduced by Stynes and Tobiska. For smooth problems, the schemes satisfy error bounds of the form O(h)juj 2 in an energy norm. In addition, extensive numerical experiments show that they effectively reproduce boundary layers and internal layers caused by discontinuities on relatively coarse grids, without any requirements on alignment of flow and grid.

Here, we are concerned with necessary conditions for (17) to hold for the L 2 norm and ff &gt; 1 2 . Assume fi 1 and fi 2 are constant and the discretization is on a uniform grid using bilinear or linear elements. <p> The discrete problem then has the form X a -; u h where ^ f depends only on f , u h i;j = u h (x i ; y j ) and -;=1;0;1 a -; = 0. Theorem 3.1. <ref> [24] </ref> Let f 2 L 2 () such that the solution u o of the reduced problem fi ru o = f in (19) is in C 1 ( )"C 2 () where @ = f (x; y) 2 @ j fin &lt; 0; n is an outward unit normal vectorg. <p> Otherwise, if fi 1 6= fi 2 , then (20) and (21) constitute two linear equations with a single unknown ! s , for which there is no solution <ref> [24] </ref>. Therefore, the streamline diffusion method does not satisfy these necessary conditions for uniform convergence. 5 4. Two-parameter streamline diffusion schemes. <p> When r fi d 0 &gt; 0, one can also get an L 2 bound ku u h k Ch 3=2 juj 2 which is the same estimate for SD shown in [2]. We now consider a different approach for choosing ffi s and ffi c based on <ref> [24] </ref>. Suppose the discretization is on a uniform square mesh of width h with bilinear shape functions. The resulting coefficient matrix has the form A sda = "H + S + ffi s U + ffi c C;(33) where C is as in (16).

Reference-contexts: to (1)-(2) contain internal layers caused by discontinuities in boundary conditions, the approximate solution obtained by the streamline diffusion method may suffer from overshooting and undershooting along discontinuities [13], [14, p. 186]. "Shock-capturing" streamline diffusion methods add a discontinuity capturing term (in the test functions) to reduce the local oscillations <ref> [13, 25] </ref>. Unfortunately, the shock-capturing term depends on the unknown discrete solution and this leads to a nonlinear discrete system even though the original problem is linear.

Reference-contexts: We will also consider the case d 0 &gt; 0; this is a technical assumption [2] which is used in the derivation of L 2 -error bounds. (An alternative is to include a zero-order term in (1), see [4], [5], <ref> [26] </ref>.) Experimental results described in Section 5 use benchmark problems in which fi is divergence free. <p> We have the following error estimate, the proof of which follows [1], [15], <ref> [26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: is a variable, then let h be the diameter of local element and determine ffi s elementwise as in (6) (see [14, p. 186]). 3 For this method with piecewise linear elements, pointwise error bounds of order O (h 2 j log hj) have been obtained for special meshes in <ref> [27] </ref>, where it is also shown that the width of the characteristic boundary layers and interior layers along streamlines are of order h 5=8 log 2 h. See also [22, pp. 229ff.] for discussion of such results.
