Title: Efficient Visual Search: A Connectionist Solution 1  
Date: June 26, 1991  
Pubnum: Technical Report #91-040  
Abstract: Searching for objects in scenes is a natural task for people and has been extensively studied by psychologists. In this paper we examine this task from a connectionist perspective. Computational complexity arguments suggest that parallel feed-forward networks cannot perform this task ef ficiently. One difficulty is that, in order to distinguish the target from distractors, a combination of features must be associated with a single object. Often called the binding problem, this requirement presents a serious hurdle for connectionist models of visual processing when multiple objects are present. Psychophysical experiments suggest that people use covert visual attention to get around this problem. In this paper we describe a psychologically plausible system which uses a focus of attention mechanism to locate target objects. A strategy that combines top-down and bottom-up information is used to minimize search time. The behavior of the resulting system matches the reaction time behavior of people in several interesting tasks. 1. This paper also appears in the Proceedings of the 13th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, Chicago, 1991.

Reference-contexts: The gating network contains one unit per pixel. Each gate unit receives as input three parameters (A x ,A y , and A r ) representing the center and radius of the current circular focus of attention. Only the gate units outside the circle turn on (see <ref> (Ahmad and Omohundro 1990a) </ref> for details). Each unit within the gated feature maps receives activation from the corresponding feature 2 Control High Level Recognition Image Feature Maps Network Gating Network Gated Feature Maps Priority Network detector and inhibition from a gate unit (Figure 1). <p> The main component is a coarse coded map in which the output of each unit reects the priority of the region within its receptive field. A simple and efficient way to rank regions is to use the mass of the points within the receptive field <ref> (Ahmad & Omohundro 1990a) </ref>. If this is the only ranking available, however, then search for attributes other than size could be inefficient. <p> There are networks which continually fine tune the scale and location of the focus of attention, networks for storing locations, and a network for updating the focus to the next error vector . These are described in detail in <ref> (Ahmad & Omohundro 1990ab) </ref>. The main addition is the subsystem SWIFT which controls the search process. This is described below. The SWIFT sear ch strategy. The main function of SWIFT is to integrate top-down and bottom-up knowledge to efficiently guide the search process. <p> The ratio of slopes for images with target absent to target present will be 2:1, consistent with any self-terminating serial scan. More recently it was shown that accurately detecting conjunctions depended on accurate localization of the target (Treisman & Sato 1990). This is also consistent with our architecture <ref> (Ahmad & Omohundro, 1990a) </ref>. Triple conjunction search. Search for an object defined by a conjunction of three features results in dif ferent search slopes (Quinlan & Humphreys 1987).

Reference-contexts: Linsker 1989), simple Hebbian learning can lead to features that look very similar to the features in the visual cortex. If the early features in visual cortex are in fact the principal components, then SWIFT is a simple strategy that takes advantage of it.

Reference-contexts: Experiments on visual search suggest that objects with the same features or form as the tar get object can get higher priority than other objects <ref> (Egeth, V irzi, & Garbart 1984) </ref>. All of this suggests a much more dynamic and ex-ible priority system than one which simply ranks the locations based on pixel density. This sort of exibility can be added to the network without sacrificing efficiency. <p> Since it is difficult to count the number of objects in parallel, the network chooses the map with the minimal total activity as the one likely to contain the minimal number of objects. SWIFT was inspired by the experiments in <ref> (Egeth, Virzi, & Garbart 1984) </ref>. These authors present evidence suggesting that serial search can be restricted to objects with a particular feature. <p> For conjunction searches T contains two features. If the number of objects with each feature is chosen randomly , on average M will be 1/2D. Therefore average search time will grow linearly with D (see <ref> (Egeth, Virzi, & Garbart 1984) </ref> for a similar argument). The ratio of slopes for images with target absent to target present will be 2:1, consistent with any self-terminating serial scan. More recently it was shown that accurately detecting conjunctions depended on accurate localization of the target (Treisman & Sato 1990).

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that a single Hebb neuron extracts the largest principal component of the input distribution and with inhibition, sets of Hebbian neurons can extract successively 5 smaller components. Moreover , as some researchers have demonstrated <ref> (e.g. Linsker 1989) </ref>, simple Hebbian learning can lead to features that look very similar to the features in the visual cortex. If the early features in visual cortex are in fact the principal components, then SWIFT is a simple strategy that takes advantage of it.

Reference-contexts: The answer is simple if SWIFT is used: searching the map with the least total activity will always produce the correct results. Parallel processing of conjunctions. Some authors have reported conjunctive feature searches which always result in at slopes. <ref> (McLeod, Driver, & Crisp 1988) </ref> report that the detection of a moving X among static Xs and moving Os can be done in parallel. (Nakayama & Silverman 1986) tested conjunction searches using the features color , motion, and depth. <p> SWIFT can explain these results if one assumes that certain feature combinations are represented in parallel. For example, <ref> (McLeod, Driver, & Crisp 1988) </ref> mentions that area MT contains cells which are tuned to both direction of motion and orientation. Since a primary feature that distinguishes Xs from Os is an oriented line, a moving X should produce a unique pattern of activity in this feature map.

Reference-contexts: Neither of these models implement a continuous focus of attention: each object is assumed to occupy exactly one pre-determined location. To our knowledge, the only realistic implementation of visual search that works with pixel-based images is in <ref> (Mozer, 1991) </ref>. The model also implements a continuous focus. There are some dif ferences in our models. In our model every aspect of the control process is made explicit, including the use of top-down information.

Reference-contexts: This is also consistent with our architecture (Ahmad & Omohundro, 1990a). Triple conjunction search. Search for an object defined by a conjunction of three features results in dif ferent search slopes <ref> (Quinlan & Humphreys 1987) </ref>. There were two situations that were tested: (a) every distractor shares exactly one feature with the tar get object, or , (b) every distractor shares exactly two features with the target.

Reference-contexts: As we will see below, this ability is crucial in efficiently carrying out visual search. There is even some direct psychological evidence to support the current architecture. When attention is highly focused, people are able to report primitive features of stimuli appearing outside the focus of attention <ref> (Rock et al. 1990) </ref> but they are unable to report shape information suggesting that higher level processing is affected. The Priority Network This gating method relies on an external mechanism for determining focus locations and this is provided by the priority network.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In 1986, Sejnowski wrote: The binding problem is a touchstone for testing network models that claim to have psychological validity <ref> (Sejnowski 1986) </ref>. In 1991, the statement is still true. In visual search two aspects of the problem are important: feature integration and localization. Feature integration is concerned with the interference between features of different objects when a parallel representation is used.

Reference-contexts: Search then proceeds by sequentially visiting locations in order of their saliency. As the focus of atten 1. The error vector representation was inspired by a similar mechanism for controlling eye saccades in the monkey superior colliculus <ref> (Sparks 1986) </ref>. tion stabilizes on each location, the control network checks the features of the current object against the stored target representation. This continues until a match is found or there are no more objects. The output of the simulator is shown in Figure 3 (a).

Reference-contexts: Such a model implies that in some situations a serial search is required. This line of reasoning is used to explain experimental results on visual search (reviewed in <ref> (Treisman 1988) </ref>). <p> In the following sections we discuss SWIFT in relation to many of the experiments that have been done. Relationship With Psychological Data Single and conjunctive featur e searches. We first show that the original search results <ref> (Treisman 1988) </ref> can be replicated with SWIFT. The experiments showed that targets defined by a single feature (e.g. a red target among blue objects) can be detected in parallel. <p> Search asymmetries. There is another search paradigm where constant and linear time searches have been reported. Searching for a line oriented 18 o among vertical lines can be done in constant time, but searching for a vertical line among these oblique lines takes linear time <ref> (Treisman 1988) </ref>. This asymmetry is explained by assuming that the early representation includes a f inite number of orientations that are coarse coded, including vertical and an orientation greater than 18 o .

Their model accounts for a wider range of results than Chapmans. Our model is consistent with their philosophy in that a smart parallel strategy is used to rank possible candidates.
