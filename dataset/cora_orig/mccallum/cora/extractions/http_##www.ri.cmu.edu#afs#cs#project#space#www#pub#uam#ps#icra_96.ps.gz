Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling an underactuated manipulator with less actuators than passive joints. The control methodology consists of dividing the passive joints in several groups, and of controlling one group at a time via its dynamic coupling with the actuators. Among the many possible control sequences for a given robot, we choose the optimal one based on the dynamic programming method. The optimization is based on a control cost defined as the reciprocal of the coupling index, a measure of the dynamic coupling available between the active and the passive joints of the manipulator. The detailed theory, computational procedures, simulation results, and experimental results are presented.

Reference-contexts: These robots are inherently nonlinear and nonholonomic, and some researchers have been working on their control considering the nonholonomic constraints [5], [6]. We, however, intend to study the control problem by assuming that all passive joints are equipped with brakes <ref> [1] </ref>. This allows us to constrain the robot to be holonomic at every instant, and to use classical robot control techniques in this new class of mechanisms. Control consists of controlling the passive joints to their set-points via their dynamic coupling with the active ones. <p> When the number of passive joints is less than or equal to the number of active ones, all passive joints can be controlled simultaneously. Because this specific case has been studied by several authorssee <ref> [1] </ref>, [3], [5], [7]we restrict ourselves to the study of manipulators with more passive joints than actuators. In this case, the passive joints have to be divided in several groups and each group has to be controlled individually. <p> The case has been studied in our earlier work and by other researchers as well (see <ref> [1] </ref>, [3], [5], and [7]). The solution consists of first controlling only the passive joints to their desired set-points via dynamic coupling with the active ones. Once this objective is reached, the passive joints can be locked in place.

Reference-contexts: We use as control cost the reciprocal of a measure of the dynamic coupling between the active and the passive joints, which we call the coupling index <ref> [2] </ref>. The greater the coupling index, the easier it is for the active joints to drive the passive ones. <p> If the number of actuators is less than the number of passive joints, this scheme breaks down, since it has been shown that only r joints can be controlled at any instant ([1], <ref> [2] </ref>). The above control scheme can be extended to the case where r &lt; p. We start by dividing the passive joints into groups of r joints each. Label these groups g 1 , ... , g s . <p> Note that the inertia matrix M in (1) is symmetric and positive definite, as demonstrated previously in <ref> [2] </ref>. This leads to the submatrices M aa and M pp also being positive definite. <p> of (1), and substituting the result on its second line, the following relationship between the acceleration of the passive joints and the torques applied at the active ones is obtained: (2) where the matrix W pp is the inverse of the Schur complement of M aa in M, shown in <ref> [2] </ref> to be positive definite: (3) We focus on the relationship between the accelerations of the passive joints and the active joints torques, and rewrite equation (2) as: (4) where: (5) The vector can be considered as a virtual acceleration of the passive joints, generated by the active torques and the

Reference-contexts: Finally, given the state transition diagram and the cost of each transition, all one has to do is apply the DP algorithm described in <ref> [4] </ref>. As explained in that reference, the DP solution is guaranteed to be globally optimum and to reach this optimum solution in less time than an exhaustive search. Note that other tree-search algorithms, such as A*, can also be used instead of DP.
