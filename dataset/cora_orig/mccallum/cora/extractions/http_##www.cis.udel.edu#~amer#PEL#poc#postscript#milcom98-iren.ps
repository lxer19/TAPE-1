Abstract: We introduce an image compression and transmission system for battlefield networks. The system is based on network-conscious image compression, an approach to compression that does not simply maximize compression, but which optimizes overall performance when compressed images are transmitted over a lossy, packet-switched battlefield network. Using an Application Level Framing philosophy, an image is compressed into path-MTU-size Application Data Units (ADUs) at the application layer. Each ADU is independent of others and carries its own semantics, that is, each ADU is a self-contained unit possessing all information necessary for decoding and displaying the information within that packet. Each independent ADU can be delivered to the receiving application out-of-order, thereby enabling faster progressive display of the image. We combine network-conscious image compression with an embedded focusing feature to provide a system that can be used in battlefield scenarios such as telemedicine or intelligence gathering. a

Reference-contexts: The other components of the testing environment are SINCGARS radios (a PPP-link is also available) to simulate low bandwidth, lossy router software to introduce artificial yet controlled loss to the network, and transport protocols that provide a variety of services between TCP and UDP <ref> [4, 6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: ADN-cancel, an innovative transport layer service, allows cancellation of messages that have already been submitted ot the transport layer. The application specifies an Application Data Name (ADN) for each message, and can cancel the transmission of any message (or group of messages) by specifying its (their) ADN <ref> [5] </ref>. Wavelet zerotree encoding is based on the hypothesis that, at a given threshold level, if a wavelet co efficient at a coarse scale is insignificant, then all wavelet coefficients of the same orientation in the same spacial location at finer scales are likely to be insignificant [12].

Reference-contexts: In ordered transport protocols, ADUs that are received out-of-order must be buffered. When missing ADUs finally arrive, buffered ADUs are delivered as a group to the application. This approach makes the delivery of ADUs to the application more bursty. The burstiness may result in bottlenecks at the receiving application <ref> [7] </ref>. Another advantage of dividing an image into ADUs is that their transmission can be tailored to each ADU characteristic. Not all parts of image data are uniform and require the same QoS. For example, low frequency coefficients of a wavelet image (i.e., important data) require a reliable service.

Reference-contexts: The focusing feature is embedded in the algorithm so that focusing on different portions of an image is made possible without decompression and recompression. This system is incorporated into our Network-Conscious Image Compression and Transmission System (NETCICATS) that have been used to test network-conscious image compression <ref> [8] </ref>. Section 2 briefly defines what a network-conscious compressed image is and describes NETCICATS. Section 3 describes the proposed system with focusing feature and explains how it might work in a real battlefield scenario. <p> It can even be used, without modifications, in a multipoint communication, where each participant has different requirements. At the University of Delaware, we have developed a system to empirically evaluate the network-conscious image compression. This system, called NETCICATS, transmits network-conscious compressed images over a lossy, low-bandwidth network <ref> [8] </ref>. The software consists of two main components: an image sender and an image receiver.

Reference-contexts: This approach permits the use of a more efficient transport protocol that does not need to preserve order. The buffer requirements at the transport receiver for an unordered protocol are always less or equal to the buffer requirements at ordered protocols <ref> [10] </ref>. Furthermore, out-of-order delivery of ADUs reduces the jitter at the receiving application. In ordered transport protocols, ADUs that are received out-of-order must be buffered. When missing ADUs finally arrive, buffered ADUs are delivered as a group to the application.

Reference-contexts: We propose a battlefield image compression and transmission system that combines progressive display and focusing with the network-conscious image compression approach. The compression method is based on wavelet zerotree encoding <ref> [12] </ref>. Our research on zerotree encoding, progressive display, and focusing differs from previous studies in that we propose a flexible image compression technique and file format in which focusing is embedded inside the code along with the network-conscious image compression. <p> Wavelet zerotree encoding is based on the hypothesis that, at a given threshold level, if a wavelet co efficient at a coarse scale is insignificant, then all wavelet coefficients of the same orientation in the same spacial location at finer scales are likely to be insignificant <ref> [12] </ref>. The embedded zerotree encoding (EZW) by Shapiro and set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) are two famous zerotree encoding methods. Both algorithms are highly state-dependent, and therefore susceptible to bit errors and packet losses. Even a single bit error can ruin the decoding process thereby destroying an entire image.

Reference-contexts: Focusing is especially useful in situations where having the same high quality for the whole image is not affordable for space or bandwidth limitations. A typical example application of this technique is medical image compression <ref> [13] </ref>. Typically regions of interest are decided before compression, and those parts of the image are compressed with higher reconstruction quality.
