Reference-contexts: It is called a reduction ordering iff 1. is well-founded; 2. if s t then u [s] u [t], for all terms s; t; u and substitutions . We shall always assume that reduction orderings are total on the set T (). Following <ref> [BGLS 92] </ref> we distinguish terms occurring in the original formula from terms introduced by substitution by using closures, i.e. pairs C , where C is a clause, a substitution. The closure C is a representation of the clause C. <p> Then the closure s 1 6= t 1 ; : : : ; s n 6= t n ; C 1 ; C 2 " is an initial closure. The equality elimination method consists of five inference rules. The basic superposition rules are defined as in <ref> [BGLS 92] </ref>. We always assume that premises of rules have disjoint variables. The first three rules derive closures from the initial closures defined above. Applications of the first three rules form the equational solution part of the proof. <p> The most powerful one is subsump-tion that we can apply in both parts of the proof in order to prevent generation of unnecessary clauses. Subsumption for the basic strategy has been explained in <ref> [Deg 82, BGLS 92] </ref>. In the sequent part of the proof we can use ordinary subsumption, or even a stronger subsumption for sequent proofs proposed in [Vor 92]. 9 Section 4 The connection method We plan to consider equality elimination for the connection method in detail in a forthcoming publication.

Reference-contexts: leftmost inequality. 2 Equality solution (C; s 6= t) where is a most general unifier of s; t. 2 According to our definitions, a clause is a set of literals, so the leftmost literal may sound as nonsense, but this restriction can easily be formalized using a variant of locking <ref> [Boy 71] </ref>. 6 Conjunction rule Let ' ^ be a subformula of fl, and N ' , N and N '^ be sets of fl-names of ', and ' ^ .

S is inconsistent. 17 Proof. Due to completeness of the basic restriction, there is a resolution refutation of S fl in which all paramodulations precede all other rules, and all equality solutions precede all resolutions (see <ref> [Deg 82, DV 86b] </ref>). Let us call such refutations regular. In S fl all arguments of non-equality predicates are variables. Then the basic strategy requires that all paramodulations be made into equations, thus becoming left or right superpositions.
