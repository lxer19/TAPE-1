Title: Models of perceptual learning in vernier hyperacuity  
Author: Yair Weiss Shimon Edelman ;? Manfred Fahle 
Date: December 3, 1992  
Abstract: Performance of human subjects in a wide variety of early visual processing tasks improves with practice. HyperBF networks (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) constitute a mathematically well-founded framework for understanding such improvement in performance, or perceptual learning, in the class of tasks known as visual hyperacuity. The present article concentrates on two issues raised by the recent psychophysical and computational findings reported in (Poggio et al., 1992b; Fahle and Edelman, 1992). First, we develop a biologically plausible extension of the HyperBF model that takes into account basic features of the functional architecture of early vision. Second, we explore various learning modes that can coexist within the HyperBF framework and focus on two unsupervised learning rules which may be involved in hyperacuity learning. Finally, we report results of psychophysical experiments that are consistent with the hypothesis that activity-dependent presynaptic amplification may be involved in perceptual learning in hyperacuity.

Reference-contexts: We do not assume, however, that there is any causal relationship between the correlation of pre- and postsynaptic activities, and the synaptic modification. Hence, our rule may be classified as a "non-interactive Hebbian rule" <ref> (Brown et al., 1990) </ref>. 16 4 Psychophysical experiments In the previous section, we described the difference between the two unsupervised learning rules in terms of their approach to distinguishing between signal and noise.

Reference-contexts: Second, as we have already mentioned, perceptual learning in vernier hyperacuity is specific for stimulus orientation <ref> (Fahle and Edelman, 1992) </ref>, a possible indication that performance in this task is based, at least in part, on interpolation among input examples acquired during learning. <p> Under these conditions, the subjects' thresholds improve with practice, albeit at a slower rate than when explicit feedback is available <ref> (Fahle and Edelman, 1992) </ref>. 4.

In our simulations we assumed that all the units received the modulatory signal, that is, the network had no a priori knowledge as to the activities of which units were more likely to be significant.

Reference-contexts: Unlike in <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992a) </ref> where a transduction stage was used, in version A of the present model the 3 psychophysical masking experiments (Wilson and Gelb, 1984), this network can solve the vernier task at a much smaller threshold than the size of the excitatory region of each unit. <p> We note that the HyperBF approach is equally capable of modeling retinally or cortically based hyperacuity mechanisms. While our present model used orientationally selective units similar to cortical simple cells, the HyperBF scheme of <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992a) </ref> that relied on responses of circularly symmetric units was equally successful in replicating hyperacuity phenomena. <p> Performance is improved by modifying the connections between these neurons and the output neuron. 3.2 Different learning modes in a HyperBF network In <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992a) </ref>, a HyperBF network was synthesized from a "tabula rasa" initial state. Only the shape of the basis functions (that were radially symmetric multidimensional Gaussians) was assumed to be given. <p> Rationale for this twofold assumption has been provided by the results of simulated psychophysical experiments <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992a) </ref> that demonstrated that a HyperBF model can learn to solve spatial discrimination tasks with hyperacuity precision, starting from a "tabula rasa" state and continuously improving its performance with repeated exposure to the stimuli. <p> We remark that the perceptual module whose prior availability is assumed by the EDL rule can either be hard-wired from birth, or synthesized in a task-driven fashion, as suggested in <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992a) </ref>. If one accepts the possibility that the visual system is capable of modifying certain aspects of its functional architecture on the fly, the stimulus-driven learning can be given an alternative account in terms of acquisition of new HyperBF centers (T. Poggio, personal communication).

Reference-contexts: In the present report, we show that a recently proposed mathematical framework for learning from examples, known as HyperBF approximation (Poggio and Girosi, 1990), yields a biologically plausible and flexible model of perceptual learning in early vision. Following the work described in <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992b) </ref>, we concentrate on the example of learning vernier hyperacuity. 1.1 HyperBF networks Within the HyperBF framework, the problems of detection and discrimination of visual stimuli are approached in terms of the computation of multivariate functions defined over the input space. <p> In the modeling of vernier acuity, this assumption is supported by the psychophysical findings of stimulus specificity of learning, which cannot be accounted for by decision-level changes alone <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992b) </ref>. 1.3 Vernier hyperacuity A vernier target consists of two line segments, separated by a small offset in the direction orthogonal to the orientation of the lines. <p> It is not clear to us at present whether or not this possibility can be distinguished psychophysically from our account in terms of synaptic modification using existing centers and the EDL rule. The presence of the initial fast stimulus-specific component in the learning curve in hyperacuity tasks <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992b) </ref> is consistent with the module synthesis view.

Reference-contexts: In the present report, we show that a recently proposed mathematical framework for learning from examples, known as HyperBF approximation <ref> (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) </ref>, yields a biologically plausible and flexible model of perceptual learning in early vision. <p> In a standard implementation, the task of approximating a function is divided into two stages <ref> (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) </ref>: an initial (usually non-linear) transformation, in which the input is mapped into a set of basis functions, and a linear stage, in which the output function is computed as a linear combination of the basis functions. <p> If the basis functions are radial, then h i (x) = h i (kx x 0 k), where x 0 are called the centers of the chosen set of basis functions. In a distributed implementation of this scheme by a multilayer network <ref> (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) </ref>, h represents the response of units in an intermediate layer to the stimulus, and c represents the weights of the synapses between the intermediate layer and the output unit. 1.2 Modeling 2AFC experiments with HyperBF networks Because the output of the HyperBF module is a continuous function

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The term "perceptual learning" refers to the significant improvement, precipitated by practice, in the performance of human subjects in various perceptual tasks <ref> (Walk, 1978) </ref>. Some of the more intriguing aspects of perceptual learning, such as its specificity for particular stimulus parameters, and the associated lack of performance transfer to new parameter values (Fiorentini and Berardi, 1981; Karni and Sagi, 1991), remained until not long ago without an adequate computational explanation.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, this astonishing precision of vernier discrimination, termed hyperacuity, is maintained even when the target is in motion <ref> (Westheimer and McKee, 1975) </ref>. It should be noted that hyperacuity performance does not contradict any physical law, since the optics of the eye at the fovea satisfy the constraints of the sampling theorem, making the spatial information recoverable in principle, by appropriate filtering (Barlow, 1979; Crick et al., 1981).

Reference-contexts: Threshold was estimated by making assumptions regarding the statistical distributions of the noise sources. These distributions were held fixed as stimulus parameters varied. Compare to Figure 6. a. b. plot show data from two observers, replotted from <ref> (Westheimer and McKee, 1977) </ref>. 2.3 Discussion Since both versions of the model (A and B) can serve as the basis for hyperacuity level performance, we adopted the simpler, linear, version that omits the transduction stage, as a minimalist platform for studying the improvement of hyperacuity with practice. <p> In these simulations the statistical distribution of the noise was held fixed (and thus thresholds could be estimated) while the parameters of the stimulus varied. The dependence of the threshold on line length exhibited by the model agrees reasonably well with the data in <ref> (Westheimer and McKee, 1977) </ref>. Specifically, the threshold decreases steeply with increasing segment length for lengths under 4 0 , and is essentially unaffected by further increase. The dependence of the threshold on line separation, however, agrees with psychophysical data only qualitatively.

Reference-contexts: Both the results regarding line length and line separation can be attributed to the fact that the width y of the spatial frequency mechanism used by the model was 3:65 0 <ref> (Wilson and Bergen, 1979) </ref>. As Wilson has pointed out, increasing line length beyond the value of y does not add any significant information, while increasing line separation beyond y forces the human subject to use the less sensitive spatial mechanisms.
