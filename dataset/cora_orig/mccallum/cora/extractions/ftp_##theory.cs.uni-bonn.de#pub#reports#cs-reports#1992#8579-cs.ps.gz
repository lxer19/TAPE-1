Abstract: ff I X I contains at most t terms. In [BT 88], [GKS 90] (see also [GK 87] and [Ka 89]) the problem of interpolation of t-sparse polynomial given by a black-box for its evaluation has been solved. In this paper we shall assume that F is a field of characteristic zero. One can consider a t-sparse polynomial as a polynomial represented by a straight-line program or an arithmetic circuit of the depth 2 where on the first level there are multiplications with unbounded fan-in and on the second level there is an addition with fan-in t. In the present paper we consider a generalization of the notion of sparsity, namely we say that a polynomial g(X 1 ; : : : ; X n ) 2 F [X 1 ; : : : ; X n ] is shifted t-sparse if for a suitable nonsingular n fi n matrix A and a vector B the polynomial g(A(X 1 ; : : : ; X n ) T + B) is t-sparse. One could consider g as being represented by a straight-line program of the depth 3 where on the first level (with the fan-in n + 1) a linear transformation A(X 1 ; : : : ; X n ) T +B is computed. One could also consider a shifted t-sparse polynomial as t-sparse with respect to other coordinates (Y 1 ; : : : ; Y n ) T = A(X 1 ; : : : ; X n ) T + B.
