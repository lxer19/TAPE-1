Abstract: We extend tests of "Naik" and "fat link" improvements of the Kogut-Susskind quark action to full QCD simulations, and verify that the improvements previously demonstrated in the quenched approximation apply also to dynamical quark simulations. We extend the study of flavor symmetry improvement to the complete set of pions, and find that the nonlocal pions are significantly heavier than the local non-Goldstone pion. These results can be used to estimate the lattice spacing necessary for realistic simulations with this action.

Reference-contexts: Kogut-Susskind quarks are preferred for studies of light quark thermodynamics because of their remnant exact chiral symmetry, but studies of quantities such as the equation of state have been severely limited by lattice effects <ref> [4] </ref>. Two improvements to the Kogut-Susskind quark action have been investigated. Adding a third nearest neighbor term [5] improves the quark dispersion relation and "free field" quantities such as the Stefan-Boltzmann law on the lattice.

Reference-contexts: Adding a third nearest neighbor term [5] improves the quark dispersion relation and "free field" quantities such as the Stefan-Boltzmann law on the lattice. The effects of this improvement on the quenched hadron spectrum have been studied by the MILC collaboration <ref> [6] </ref>, where it was found that it improves rotational symmetry as measured by the dispersion relation of the pions, but has only small effects on flavor symmetry breaking or spin splittings of the hadrons. <p> This is the same gauge action used in the MILC studies of improvement for the quenched spectrum <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> Here fi imp = 10=g 2 , and ff s = 4 log (u 0 )=3:0684. Because these are exploratory calculations, no effort was made to tune u 0 . Instead, the value found in Ref. <ref> [6] </ref> at fi imp = 7:1, u 0 = 0:8441 was used. The conventional one plaquette action was used in some simulations for comparison. S G = fi conv 3 @ x;&lt;- 1 Here fi conv = 6=g 2 . <p> Notice that we have not tadpole improved the quark action by including a factor of 1=u 2 0 in the third nearest neighbor coupling, as was done in Ref. <ref> [6] </ref>. This would have been reasonable for the Naik action, but for the one+fat+Naik it would have made much less difference, since the bulk of the coupling to the nearest neighbor sites also comes from three link paths, which presumably are boosted by the same factor. <p> Within the fairly poor statistics, this is consistent with the quenched result of Ref. <ref> [6] </ref> that, as expected, it is the Naik term that is responsible for the improvement in the dispersion relation. 6 fi m q N s S V 2 0 1 2 3 ~p fl 0 fl 5 fl 0 fl 5 fl 0 fl 5 fl i fl j fl 0 <p> The pion masses with fi imp = 7:3 or fi conv = 5:5 with various valence quark actions in Table I show that the fattening of the link improves the flavor symmetry while the Naik term has little effect, in agreement with earlier studies in the quenched approximation <ref> [6, 8, 10] </ref>. Here we also see that the improvement extends to the one-link nonlocal pions.

Reference-contexts: Dynamical high temperature studies using the Naik action with four flavors of quarks have been done by the Bielefeld group <ref> [7] </ref>. A second kind of improvement | averaging over paths in the parallel transport of the quark fields, or "fattening", does improve the flavor symmetry [8]. <p> The addition of the Naik term does an excellent job of improving the quark dispersion relation, and hence we expect to improve the equation of state in the high temperature phase <ref> [7] </ref>. However, the harder part of the job is to get the physics right on the low temperature side. Roughly, there the physics is a gas of thermally excited pions.

A second kind of improvement | averaging over paths in the parallel transport of the quark fields, or "fattening", does improve the flavor symmetry <ref> [8] </ref>. This can be understood as a suppression of the coupling to high momentum gluons which scatter quarks from one corner of the Brillouin zone to another [9], and this understanding has been used as a guide to further reducing flavor symmetry breaking by more extensive fattening [10]. <p> Note that this parameterization of the fattening is designed to be convenient for full QCD updating, and differs from the parameterization used in Ref. <ref> [8] </ref>. Four different valence quark actions were used in computing the spectrum. The conventional "one-link" quark action has c 1 = 1 and c 3 = w 3 = 0. The "Naik" action has c 1 = 9=8, c 3 = 1=24 and w 3 = 0. <p> For the "fat-link" action we arbitrarily weight each staple with one half the weight of the single link path, and normalize so that the total weight of the one link path is one: c 1 = 1=4, c 3 = 0, and w 3 = 1=8. In Ref. <ref> [8] </ref> it was found that the improvement in flavor symmetry is fairly insensitive to the exact weight of the staples. <p> The pion masses with fi imp = 7:3 or fi conv = 5:5 with various valence quark actions in Table I show that the fattening of the link improves the flavor symmetry while the Naik term has little effect, in agreement with earlier studies in the quenched approximation <ref> [6, 8, 10] </ref>. Here we also see that the improvement extends to the one-link nonlocal pions. <p> Since the masses are nearly degenerate, it makes little difference which one we use. In our analysis we used the 2 mass because it is usually estimated more accurately. This measure of flavor symmetry breaking differs from the quantity used in <ref> [8] </ref>. Here we use the squared masses since they are approximately linear in the quark mass and we will do some interpolating and extrapolating. Also, empirically this ffi 2 is fairly insensitive to the quark mass. <p> This is also supported by the quenched spectroscopy results presented in <ref> [8] </ref>. In the case of the one link action (Fig. 1), the improvement of the gauge action significantly reduces both the local and the nonlocal pion splittings. The local pion splittings are affected more than those of the nonlocal.

Reference-contexts: We study improvement in rotational 1 invariance diagnosed through the pion dispersion relation, and flavor symmetry restoration from the zero momentum masses of the pions. In addition to the local non-Goldstone pion, the " 2 ", we look also at the nonlocal pions <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. No attempt is made at this stage to study whether these improved actions show better scaling of mass ratios. 2 The simulations The gauge action used in most of these simulations was a Symanzik improved gauge action [14, 15, 16, 17]. <p> The first four columns of pion masses correspond to distance 0, 1, 2 and 3 operators respectively, all at zero momentum. There are two pion operators at each distance, shown one above the other. These operators have the "spin flavor" structures shown in the table header <ref> [12] </ref>. The Goldstone pion is the upper pion in the distance zero column.

Reference-contexts: The fermion force can be computed by a straightforward generalization of the algorithm described in <ref> [19] </ref>. The actions used here are all in the class of actions where the fermion matrix is 2m times the identity matrix plus a 6D operator which couples even sites to odd sites. <p> (4) where e is a pseudofermion defined on the even lattice sites (x + y + z + t is even). (For simplicity, we sketch the force computation for four flavors of quarks with the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm; adapting it to two flavors is done in the standard way <ref> [19] </ref>.
