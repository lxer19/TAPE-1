Abstract: An important component that has been missing from image synthesis is the effect of weathering. In this paper, we present an approach for the modeling and rendering of one type of weathering metallic patinas. A patina is a film or incrustation on a surface that is produced by the removal of material, the addition of material, or the chemical alteration of a surface. Oxidation, sulphidization, and painting are examples of phenomena that produce patinas. We represent a surface as a series of layers. Patinas are simulated with a collection of operators, such as coat, erode, and polish, which are applied to the layered structure. The development of patinas is modulated according to an object's geometry and local environmental factors. We introduce a technique to model the reflectance and transmission of light through the layered structure using the Kubelka-Munk model. This representation yields a model that can simulate many aspects of the time-dependent appearance of metals as they are exposed to the atmosphere or treated chemically. We demonstrate the approach with a collection of copper models.

Reference-contexts: We draw on fractal surface growth models, used mainly in physics and various branches of engineering. These models are concerned with the morphology of various pre-formed interfaces and with the dynamics of how the morphology develops over time <ref> [1] </ref>. Starting with procedural texture models, several researchers have attempted to simulate related weathering effects. Becket and Badler [2] modeled surface imperfections through texture specification and generation techniques, which are based on fractal subdivision and simple distribution models. <p> In order to simulate variations in thickness over time, we have implemented a series of fractal surface growth models for use with the layer structure. Many of these approaches are variations of models from the book by Barabasi and Stanley <ref> [1] </ref>. We chose a set of models that deals with the deposition of material and the lateral growth of patches on surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Related work exists in three areas: procedural textures and fractal surface growth models, specific weathering models, and layered surface representations. Procedural textures [6] can be used to build up complex patterns that often resemble natural effects. For example, the shade tree concept of Cook <ref> [4] </ref> allowed arbitrary procedures to define a different shading model for each surface, as well as lighting and atmospheric optics. Perlin [26] described an entire procedural language to define textures and laid the foundation for the stochastically-generated textures that permeate rendering today.

Reference-contexts: In addition, some simple texture maps were created with a noise function and combined with the layer structure to simulate the staining due to the flow of water over the top of the tower. Modeling such washing and staining effects is the subject of a separate work <ref> [5] </ref>. In the tower on the right, there is a thin layer of cuprite on the base copper. This is augmented with a fairly uniform layer of patina. We also added a thin layer of dirt, which is common to urban patinas.

These materials are treated in various ways to simulate the process of weathering. Since such treatments can be highly desirable (from prewashed jeans to fake antiques), modeling them is impor tant [24].

Reference-contexts: For example, a common application of RenderMan is to develop surface descriptions as a series of layers [31]. Another area of interest is the modeling of reflection and transmission of light through layered surfaces. Han-rahan and Krueger <ref> [13] </ref> present a model for subsurface scattering in layered surfaces in terms of one-dimensional linear transport theory. This model is useful for rendering common layered materials such as skin, snow, and dust. <p> Second, the above model does not account for scattering events in the intervening layers before or after the glossy reflection. In general, accounting for this would require the full solution of the one-dimensional transport equation, as was done in Hanrahan and Krueger <ref> [13] </ref>. The precise nature of the errors introduced by these approximations needs further study. But our approximations capture quite well all the major visual effects that we hoped to achieve. Finally, we output the final thickness of the stack of layers by summing the thicknesses of each layer.

It may describe the results of either deliberately applied craft processes or natural corrosion <ref> [16] </ref>. Metals in general and the finished metal surface in particular begin to change under the influence of the atmosphere, or the local chemical environment, as soon as they are exposed. <p> In our work we have estimated the KM parameters by matching synthesized color samples to physical copper and mineral specimens, as well as photographs, such as those found in Hughes and Rowe <ref> [16] </ref>. We generally match R 1 to the sample, determine K=S from the above formula, and assume a value for S. This approach has enough accuracy to capture the range of colors and color effects that we are attempting to model.

The atmosphere alters the surface of a metal, causing gradual changes that quickly tarnish it with a thin, but uneven, dark coloring, and may eventually convert the whole surface into crumbly mineral products.

Once this layer is in place, subsequent layers grow much more slowly. The primary chemical constituents of the patina on copper and copper alloys include copper oxides, sul-phides, and inorganic and organic copper salts. <p> In a rural environment, the rate is less, about :5m per year; in an urban environment the rate is slightly greater, about 1 2m. These rates are highest during the first few years of exposure and approach a lower, almost negligible rate after about 20 years <ref> [22] </ref>. While the preceding section gives a descrip growth of copper patinas in marine, rural, and urban atmospheres. tion of the development of patinas in three different environments, including the constituents of the patina and general growth rates, the development can be further influenced by a specific surrounding environment. <p> There are many other factors that affect the corrosion of metals, such as the composition of the electrolyte on the surface and the temperature; variations in surface thickness due to abrasions, polishing, and pitting are also relevant. However, the influence of these factors is not well understood <ref> [22] </ref>, and we do not consider them further in this paper. 3 Modeling As we observed in the previous section, the development of a metallic patina is a process that proceeds in a complex system of layers.

This parameter does vary spatially as determined by the accessibility map (the accessibility map is computed as a preprocess, and therefore there is a single accessibility value per triangle) <ref> [23] </ref>. Thus, tarnish appears in cracks and crevices, and shiny copper appears in exposed areas. * The green patina consists of a steadily thickening layer and a set of steadily growing random patches.

We call this process subsurface compositing to differentiate it from the normal compositing operators widely used in computer graphics <ref> [27] </ref>. Subsurface compositing differs from normal compositing in that visible light is always assumed to be transmitted through each layer twice, which gives rise to a T 2 factor in front of each reflectance. This lowers the visibility of underlying layers.
