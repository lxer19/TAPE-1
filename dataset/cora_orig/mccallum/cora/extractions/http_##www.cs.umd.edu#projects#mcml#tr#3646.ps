Abstract: Unlike static networks, ad-hoc networks have no spatial hierarchy and suffer from frequent link failures which prevent mobile hosts from using traditional routing schemes. Under these conditions, mobile hosts must find routes to destinations without the use of designated routers and also must dynamically adapt the routes to the current link conditions. This paper proposes a distributed adaptive routing protocol for finding and maintaining stable routes based on signal strength and location stability in an ad-hoc network and presents an architecture for its implementation.

Reference-contexts: The dynamic source routing proposed in [JM96] uses broadcasts to propagate the route request. Each node which forwards the route request adds its address to the source list. When the request reaches the destination a complete route is listed in the packet. The Lightweight Mobile Routing approach proposed in <ref> [CE95] </ref> floods the network with a query broadcast when the route is desired. The nodes receiving this query broadcast either forward the broadcast or broadcast a reply to the destination with the requested route. This approach uses link status to create routes and prevent looping.

Reference-contexts: Most routing approaches for ad-hoc networks assume a rate of change that is not so fast as to make flooding the only alternative. The requirements and difficulties of ad-hoc routing are discussed in <ref> [CMB96] </ref>. One type of ad-hoc routing methods seeks to modify existing routing algorithms for use in a dynamic topology. The Destination Sequenced Distance Vector algorithm [PB94] modifies the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm to prevent looping by including sequence number to 17 order the routing information.

Reference-contexts: Information is propagated through the network to achieve this goal. Another type of ad-hoc routing algorithms uses an on demand philosophy. Routes to a destination are only sought if the node has something to send to that destination. The dynamic source routing proposed in <ref> [JM96] </ref> uses broadcasts to propagate the route request. Each node which forwards the route request adds its address to the source list. When the request reaches the destination a complete route is listed in the packet.

Reference-contexts: The Path Find algorithm in [MGLA95] is a distance vector routing protocol, which uses second-to-last hop to a destination to identify a route and prevent looping. The approach presented in <ref> [KCVP96] </ref> finds and maintains clusters in the ad-hoc network. The boundary nodes connect clusters and perform routing using a traditional routing algorithm. For all of these methods, each node, or the boundary nodes, needs to know the topology of the entire network at all times.

Reference-contexts: Traditional routing algorithms which depend on hierarchical addressing schemes and pass detailed routing tables between designated routers, are not effective in ad-hoc networks due to the high rate of topology change <ref> [LNT87] </ref>, [RT87]. In a dynamic network, the routing tables are soon out-of-date and the propagation of the route information is too slow to be accurate. In addition, the changing topology makes looping routes a problem. Hence, new routing algorithms need be developed to support ad-hoc networks.

Reference-contexts: The nodes receiving this query broadcast either forward the broadcast or broadcast a reply to the destination with the requested route. This approach uses link status to create routes and prevent looping. Route erasure is required when the topology changes. The Associativity Based Routing approach <ref> [Toh] </ref> also uses broadcast queries to find desired routes, but the optimal route is selected by the destination based on the stability of the route 18 and shortest path.
