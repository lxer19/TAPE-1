Abstract: The pedagogic perspectives of Piaget's cognitive development theories are enlarged through the use and study of artificial organisms that are represented by real robots. By using simple assembly kits, students at all levels are able to project and construct real robots that simulate the behaviors of real animals. The process of constructing real robots helps students to understand concepts about complex dynamic systems by realizing how global behaviors of the artificial organisms emerge from local dynamics. This is done through a construction process, where the students, in order to obtain a given behavior, modify both the mind and the body of the artificial organisms. Further, the construction of populations of artificial organisms helps one to realize the differences in observing behaviors at individual (microscopic) and at population (macroscopic) level. The development of a population of robots with a given behavior can take place as an evolution process. By applying selective reproduction on a population of robots, the Darwinian evolution theory can be taught with a powerful means, since the results of selection, reproduction and mutation can be observed over a short time scale, which is very seldom true for biological experiments. A number of projects with real robots that follow these pedagogic perspectives are reviewed and shown useful both in integrating intelligent systems in science, technology, psychology, and biology curricula and in using intelligent systems to enlarge our view on the biological reality.
