Note: Submission (December 18, 1997) to 'Empirical Software Engineering'  (Received Accepted in final form The experiment was initially performed with 74 graduate students at the University of Karlsruhe, Germany, with programs written in Java. The experiment was repeated with 22 undergraduate students  USA, with the programs rewritten in C++.  
Abstract: This paper reports on two controlled and repeatable experiments investigating whether software design patterns improve software quality and programmer productivity during software maintenance. Subjects performed maintenance tasks on two programs ranging from 360 to 560 LOC including comments. Both programs contained design patterns. The controlled variable was whether the design patterns were documented or not. The experiments thus tested whether pattern documentation helps during maintenance, provided patterns are present. A conservative analysis of the results supports the hypothesis that pattern-relevant maintenance tasks are completed faster and with fewer errors if pattern documentation is provided. The results also suggest that the positive effects of pattern documentation do not rely on a particular programming language and background.
