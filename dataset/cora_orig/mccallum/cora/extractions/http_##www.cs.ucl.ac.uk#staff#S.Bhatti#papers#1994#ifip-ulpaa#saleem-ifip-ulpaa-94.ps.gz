Abstract: This paper describes work carried out in the ESPRIT "MIDAS" project to provide for secure management in the context of the ISO standards for network and system management. The intention of the MIDAS work is to make use of security mechanisms which have already been standardised (for example X.509 authentication) and to make these available through a conventional implementation of the CMIP protocol. The principle application for MIDAS is the management of large X.400 systems. The paper presents an analysis of the security requirements for this application and describes the details of the mechanisms which are being implemented.

Reference-contexts: Given our contexts of Open Systems and Management we have drawn heavily on the following; ISO/ITU work on authentication through the use of public key encryption and trusted "certification authorities" <ref> [2] </ref>. This approach to security has been adopted by several OSI applications so there is a strong motivation to use it for management. ISO/ITU work on access control both in general [3] and specifically in the case of management [4]. Internet work on security in SNMPv2 [5].

MIDAS constraints Although MIDAS is constructing its own management platform, which includes full CMIP support, we would like, if possible, to ensure that the mechanisms we choose can be used with other CMIP implementations. <p> If the association is accepted then the initiator has unrestricted access, otherwise it has none. The finest level applies access control on a per-attribute, per-operation basis. The "item rule" mechanism defined for OSI management in the committee draft which was available to us <ref> [4] </ref> does indeed allow this very fine granularity; further, it specifies a very powerful mechanism to identify the "targets" (MOs, attributes etc.) to which an access control rule should apply. <p> We do not see a reasonable way to implement the full function of the item rules as specified in <ref> [4] </ref> and our initial implementation will not include them in any form. We believe, in any case, that the next draft CD may change the item rule mechanism. We have implemented the global and default rules defined in [4] which work as follows: Global rules apply in the absence of item <p> to implement the full function of the item rules as specified in <ref> [4] </ref> and our initial implementation will not include them in any form. We believe, in any case, that the next draft CD may change the item rule mechanism. We have implemented the global and default rules defined in [4] which work as follows: Global rules apply in the absence of item rules. They apply to every MO in the Managed System but only with respect to a designated list of "initiators".

Reference-contexts: Internet work on security in SNMPv2 [5]. The US "OSI Implementors Workshop" (OIW) "Stable Agreements" which attempt to make workable selections from amongst the efforts of the standards bodies [6]. The OMNIPoint/NM Forum security work <ref> [7] </ref> which draws heavily on the OIW work. Unfortunately, at the present time, none of this work completely satisfies our requirements. This is especially true when one comes to the detail of implementation where one frequently discovers gaps in specification or unresolved inconsistencies. <p> MIDAS PRIORITIES Threats T1 and T2 are identified as "Primary Threats" in <ref> [7] </ref> and these are certainly the most important threats for MIDAS. If these are not tackled than it is possible for a managed system to be fooled into acting on bogus management commands. <p> An attack which subverted (say) the ROS [9] or Transport services by injecting disruptive PDUs into the stream cannot be countered by a secure management mechanism but would certainly deny service. 6. SECURITY SERVICES The following security services are identified in <ref> [7] </ref> as being suitable to counter the "primary threats". S1) Peer entity authentication which establishes unambiguously the identity of the initiator of an operation and is part of the counter to threat T1 above. Further, having a properly authenticated identity may be an important input to an access control decision. <p> It is feasible, for example, to use public key encryption in association establishment. With this in mind we have chosen: M1) To authenticate associations through the use of public key encryption using the RSA algorithm. This is the mechanism described in X.509 <ref> [3, 7] </ref> and provides service S1. M2) To add cryptographic checksums to all management PDUs calculated according to the MD5 algorithm [10]. This provides services S2 and S3.

Reference-contexts: When this has occurred we have had to make our own choices. Many of the problems we have encountered will be resolved by the introduction of the Generic Upper Layers Security standards <ref> [8] </ref>, however, these were not considered sufficiently stable. 4. THREATS TO MANAGEMENT SECURITY The range of threats to which communication may be subject and the security services through which it may be defended have been described extensively [5][7]. A brief summary is given here in the context of remote management.

Reference-contexts: Hence we will not defend against threat T4. Threat T5 is very difficult to defend against. In fact, an attack which flooded an intermediate network with junk traffic is indistinguishable from normal network congestion as far as the end-systems are concerned. An attack which subverted (say) the ROS <ref> [9] </ref> or Transport services by injecting disruptive PDUs into the stream cannot be countered by a secure management mechanism but would certainly deny service. 6. SECURITY SERVICES The following security services are identified in [7] as being suitable to counter the "primary threats".

Reference-contexts: Confidentiality is achieved by encryption using the recipient's public key. Figure 1 shows the complete association set-up exchange. In Figure 1 the "credentials" are formed essentially in accordance with X.511 <ref> [12] </ref>. There is no explicit place in the X.511 "credentials" syntax for carrying a session secret. One possibility is to make use of the "random" field; however we are concerned that this field may be used for other purposes in some security packages.
