Reference-contexts: 0 j m, we define the operator E j as follows: a : IR m+1 ! IR; E j a (v) := a (v + * j ): Then Equation 3.1 can equivalently be written as p (x) = @ j=0 1 d where x has barycentric coordinates u (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: For the univariate case the total positivity properties of the Bezier representation give rise to many such shape preserving properties, see [5]. For the bivariate case, total positivity is not available, but it is shown in <ref> [2] </ref> that convexity of the Bezier net implies convexity of the polynomial surface. This work also implies (though it is not stated there) that the Bernstein polynomial B d f of a function f on a triangle preserves a stronger form of convexity, which is related to the triangle. <p> For m = 2 this is (29) - (31) of <ref> [2] </ref>, while for m = 3 this is (2.11) and (2.20) of [3]. <p> X u i E i b fl (0): The last equality follows from the multi-nomial theorem and Definition 4.2: if fl = * i , then (4.2) implies P m j E j b (0) = E i b fl (0). 2 We remark that this generalizes Theorem 8 of <ref> [2] </ref>, though the proof here is simpler. We now derive a formula for the Bezier coefficients with respect to the simplices in the standard triangulation T 2 (V 0 ; : : : ; V m ) of V.

Reference-contexts: Curiously most of the above results have not previously been extended to more than two dimensions. One paper which considers this problem is <ref> [3] </ref>, where it is shown that for a polynomial defined on a simplex in any dimension, convexity of the Bezier net implies convexity of the polynomial. In this paper we extend the remaining results. <p> In more than two dimensions the situation is interesting in that there are many triangulations over which one can define the Bezier net, depending on the ordering of the vertices. We study such triangulations in Section 2. While these are the same triangulations as considered in <ref> [3] </ref>, we study them in more detail so as to gain, in particular, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for the convexity of the Bezier net, which were not given in [3]. <p> We study such triangulations in Section 2. While these are the same triangulations as considered in <ref> [3] </ref>, we study them in more detail so as to gain, in particular, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for the convexity of the Bezier net, which were not given in [3]. These conditions are derived in Section 3, where they are used to show that the Bernstein polynomial B d f of a function f on a simplex preserves a stronger form of convexity, that takes the generating directions of the simplex into account. <p> We define the Bezier net ^p of p with respect to V to be the unique continuous function on V which is linear or each element of T d;m (V) and satisfies ^p 1 Vfl = b (fl); jflj = d: (3:2) It is shown in <ref> [3] </ref> that if ^p is convex in V, then so is p. However, [3] does not give explicit conditions for ^p to be convex and these we shall now give. <p> respect to V to be the unique continuous function on V which is linear or each element of T d;m (V) and satisfies ^p 1 Vfl = b (fl); jflj = d: (3:2) It is shown in <ref> [3] </ref> that if ^p is convex in V, then so is p. However, [3] does not give explicit conditions for ^p to be convex and these we shall now give. <p> As in the proof of Lemma 2.5 of <ref> [3] </ref>, the convexity of ^p is equivalent to the convexity of ^p restricted to the union of each pair of simplices in T d;m that share a common face of dimension m 1. <p> We show that one needs only consider a 2D slice of the abutting simplices and hence the equivalence of a) and b) follows from Inequality (2.2b) of Lemma 2.5 in <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 Suppose that U and W in T d have a common face of dimension m 1. <p> For i = 0, we define U, W similarly. It now follows from the proof of Lemma 2.5 of <ref> [3] </ref>, specifically Inequality 2.26, that a) is equivalent to b). <p> For m = 2 this is (29) - (31) of [2], while for m = 3 this is (2.11) and (2.20) of <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> It follows from Theorem 2.2 of <ref> [3] </ref> that B d f is convex.2 Theorem 3.4 If f in C 0 (V) is strongly convex wrto. V, then f is convex. By Lemma 3.3, B d f is convex for all d.

Reference-contexts: Under suitable successive subdivision, these composite Bezier nets will converge to the polynomial surface and can be computed by efficient algorithms [10]. A particular algorithm for regular subdivision of a triangle is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. This type of regular subdivision preserves the convexity of the Bezier net [6], (which is not true of subdivision procedures in general [8]), and thus gives an efficient means of gaining a sequence of convex, piecewise linear surfaces converging to a convex polynomial surface. <p> In Section 4, we derive an efficient algorithm for computing the Bezier points on a regular subdivision of a simplex, generalizing the algorithm in <ref> [4] </ref>. Finally, in Section 5, we show that this subdivision process preserves the convexity of the Bezier net.

Reference-contexts: One useful feature is that the appropriate piecewise linear interpolant of the Bezier points, the so-called Bezier net, reflects the shape of the polynomial curve or surface. For the univariate case the total positivity properties of the Bezier representation give rise to many such shape preserving properties, see <ref> [5] </ref>. For the bivariate case, total positivity is not available, but it is shown in [2] that convexity of the Bezier net implies convexity of the polynomial surface.

Reference-contexts: For m = 1 this is equivalent to convexity of f . For m = 2 it is defined in <ref> [7] </ref> and is independent of the order of V 0 ; V 1 ; V 2 . For m 3, the definition depends on the ordering of V 0 ; : : : ; V m .

Reference-contexts: V, then f is convex. By Lemma 3.3, B d f is convex for all d. But it is well-known that B d f converges uniformly to f as d ! 1, <ref> [9] </ref>, and hence f is convex.2 From Lemma 3.2, we immediately have Corollary 3.5 If f is in C 2 (V) and satisfies Inequality 3.5, then f is convex. Finally we have the following stronger form of Lemma 3.3. Theorem 3.6 If f is strongly convex wrto.

Reference-contexts: If the interval or triangle is subdivided, then a new piecewise linear approximation can be gained by combining the Bezier nets over the constituent pieces. Under suitable successive subdivision, these composite Bezier nets will converge to the polynomial surface and can be computed by efficient algorithms <ref> [10] </ref>. A particular algorithm for regular subdivision of a triangle is given in [4].
