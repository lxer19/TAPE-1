Reference-contexts: The logistic equation is the canonical example used to illustrate chaotic dynamical systems. Consequently, it is a logical choice for our research. We used the genetic algorithm package, LibGA <ref> [1] </ref>, to implement a genetic algorithm for the logistic equation. The chromosome was composed of a single double precision floating point value. A pool of such chromosomes was generated at random with a pool size of 100. The allele values were limited to the range [0::1].

Reference-contexts: Only basic concepts of chaotic dynamical systems are discussed below. Devaney [3] and Gleick [4] are excellent sources for a more thorough investigation into dynamical systems and chaos. Devaney <ref> [2] </ref> is an excellent source for researchers with an in-depth knowledge of calculus. Definitions The basic operation of dynamical systems is iteration. Iteration is the repetition of a process.

Reference-contexts: Such unpredictable systems are chaotic dynamical systems. Researchers study simple chaotic systems hoping it will lead to a better understanding of more complex and unpredictable problems such as predicting the direction of the stock market and weather forecasting.

Reference-contexts: Offspring are generated through a process called crossover, which can be augmented by mutation. The offspring are then placed back in the pool, perhaps replacing other members of the pool. This process can be modeled using either a `generational' <ref> [5, 6] </ref> or a `steady-state' [7] genetic algo rithm. The generational GA saves offspring in a tem-porary location until the end of a generation. At that time the offspring replace the entire current population.
