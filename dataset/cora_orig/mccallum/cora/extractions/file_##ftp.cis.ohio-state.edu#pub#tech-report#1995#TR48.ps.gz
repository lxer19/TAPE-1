Abstract: With the introduction of a wide variety of portable computing devices recently, many LANs have been extended with wireless infrastructures in efforts to provide them with wireless and/or nomadic access to existing networks. When portable or mobile computing devices are used in real-time computing, a need for mobile real-time communications arises. Given FDDI's popularity as an underlying network for real-time computing, we are motivated to investigate the issue of supporting real-time communications in an FDDI-based mobile network, in which base stations of the wireless infrastructure are connected to an FDDI backbone. In real-time communications, a message sent from a mobile host (MH) to another mobile host (MH) must be delivered in a timely fashion from the source MH to a base station (BS), from the BS to another BS, then from the later BS to the destination MH. We are primarily concerned with the part of communications between two base stations (over the FDDI backbone). We identify a wide range of problems concerning bandwidth allocation, bandwidth management, and QOS guarantee in the face of handoffs. As solutions to these problems, we propose a bandwidth management scheme that allocates synchronous bandwidth to arriving calls; a handoff control protocol that makes handoffs transparent to mobile users; an overhead bandwidth management scheme that allocates overhead bandwidth to handoffs; and a strategy to minimize the needed amount of overhead bandwidth. The proposed solutions are compatible with the FDDI standards. fl Research reported herein was supported in part by National Science Foundation under contract No. CDA 9413962, by U.S. Army Research Office under contract No. DAAL03-92-G-0184, and by Performance Analysis Lab of The Ohio State University.

Its functions include: (1) allocation of the limited synchronous bandwidth resources, (2) monitoring of the bandwidth allocation, and (3) recovery from ring instability due to bandwidth over-allocation. Each station has a station management (SMT) module.

Reference-contexts: In real-time communications, the value of a message depends on the time it is delivered to the destination. The desired delivery time is typically specified as a bound on a message's end-to-end delay time or latency, resulting in a deadline being associated with each message <ref> [5] </ref>. A message arriving at the destination after its deadline has expired may be of little or even no use to the end application. Real-time communications in various networks have been intensively studied by researchers (e.g., [10, 12, 13, 32]). Reference [5] provides an excellent survey on real-time communications in packet-switched <p> resulting in a deadline being associated with each message <ref> [5] </ref>.

As for multi-access networks, there were efforts in extending the CSMA/CD protocol to real-time systems [23, 31]. <p> There are soft and hard real-time communications. Soft real-time communications allow some number of lost packets. Tolerable losses may range from 5% for speech, 10% for music, to as high 6 as 50% for some short audio segments <ref> [5] </ref>. Hard real-time communications are expected to have zero packet loss. Here, "zero" should be interpreted as practically zero or virtually zero, rather than absolutely zero. For in any communication system, as long as transmission errors are possible, absolutely zero loss rate cannot be achieved under delay constraints. <p> Here, "zero" should be interpreted as practically zero or virtually zero, rather than absolutely zero. For in any communication system, as long as transmission errors are possible, absolutely zero loss rate cannot be achieved under delay constraints. Error control remains a major open problem in real-time communications <ref> [5] </ref>. Thus, in this paper, a real-time channel is regarded as capable of supporting hard real-time communications if its packet loss rate is not much higher than the packet transmission error rate, which is about 10 6 per packet in FDDI networks.

Reference-contexts: An X-network-based mobile network is an X-network appended with wireless extension. For instance, an Ethernet-based wireless LAN built at Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center has "base stations" installed in the ceiling and connected together by an Ethernet, with custom-built portable computing devices called "pads" as mobile hosts <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition to base stations, which provide access points to mobile hosts, an X-network may include other stations as well. Network X could be any network, not necessarily a LAN.

The concept of real-time channel was first proposed in <ref> [13] </ref>. It is a simplex virtual connection with guaranteed quality of service (QOS). Two-way communications are supported by two such channels, one in each direction. The required QOS in real-time communications is typically in the form of delay time. <p> For ease of discussions, we assume that both of the end communicating parties are mobile hosts. Mobile real-time communications are supported by mobile real-time channels. As in <ref> [13] </ref>, a two-way channel is modeled as two simplex channels, one in each direction.

Reference-contexts: Real-time communication is more complicated than other services available in FDDI networks. If we can extend this service with mobility, providing other services to mobile users will be relatively easy. In <ref> [14] </ref>, a metropolitan area network (MAN) that links base stations, databases, and a cellular control, is connected to an ATM network. The MAN, referred to as a cellular packet switch, works as an interface between the cellular infrastructure and the ATM network. <p> The MAN, referred to as a cellular packet switch, works as an interface between the cellular infrastructure and the ATM network.

The FDDI-based mobile network we wish to discuss in this paper is not intended to be used as a cellular packet switch. Rather, it is intended to be used as a stand-alone network that provides communication services to a (local-area) real-time system.

Reference-contexts: At any time, each MH has only one local BS, even when it is in two cells' overlapped area. 3.2 Handoff When an MH moves from one cell to another, it changes its local BS. This phenomenon is known as handoff. According to <ref> [16] </ref>, there are three types of handoffs: hard handoffs, seamless handoffs, 7 and soft handoffs. In a hard handoff, the MH changes its radio channel (frequency) instantly. <p> For a seamless or soft handoff, the MH simultaneously talks with the old and the new base stations for a short period of time, called degradation interval, which may last as long as several seconds [30]. (For the difference between seamless and soft handoffs, the reader is referred to <ref> [16] </ref>.) Soft handoffs are employed in the U.S. CDMA standard (IS-92) and considered in the European UMTS standard. They are expected to be popular in the future wireless systems.

Reference-contexts: Recently, there is considerable interest in mobile computing. A wide variety of portable computing devices such as laptop, palmtop, and pen-pad computers have been introduced. In order to provide these portable devices with access to wired networks, many LANs have been extended with wireless infrastructures <ref> [26] </ref>. An X-network-based mobile network is an X-network appended with wireless extension. For instance, an Ethernet-based wireless LAN built at Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center has "base stations" installed in the ceiling and connected together by an Ethernet, with custom-built portable computing devices called "pads" as mobile hosts [6]. <p> A LAN-based 1 mobile network provides an ubiquitous computing environment in a campus, a hospital, a battle-ship, etc., in which a user can move within a local area with continuous connection to the backbone distributed computational facilities. The reader is referred to <ref> [26] </ref> for other interesting applications of wireless LANs. When portable or mobile computing devices are used in real-time computing, a need for mobile real-time communications arises.

Reference-contexts: In a hard handoff, the MH changes its radio channel (frequency) instantly. For a seamless or soft handoff, the MH simultaneously talks with the old and the new base stations for a short period of time, called degradation interval, which may last as long as several seconds <ref> [30] </ref>. (For the difference between seamless and soft handoffs, the reader is referred to [16].) Soft handoffs are employed in the U.S. CDMA standard (IS-92) and considered in the European UMTS standard. They are expected to be popular in the future wireless systems.

As for multi-access networks, there were efforts in extending the CSMA/CD protocol to real-time systems <ref> [23, 31] </ref>. Unfortunately, due to their intrinsic randomness in medium access, CSMA/CD and its variants are unable to provide a deterministic guarantee on message delivery time.

Reference-contexts: Wireless communication between an MH 2 and a BS is a topic of many papers (e.g., [7, 11, 15, 24]) and will not be discussed here. Supporting real-time communications in regular (non-mobile) FDDI networks has been studied in <ref> [1, 2, 8, 33] </ref>, where the major concern is the amount of FDDI synchronous bandwidth that is needed for a given real-time connection. Several schemes have been proposed in attempts to minimize the amount of synchronous bandwidth allocated to a connection. <p> A station cannot increase its amount of allocated synchronous bandwidth unless a positive response to the newly request is received from the BMP. 2.3 Real-Time Channel FDDI is capable of supporting real-time communications via real-time channels <ref> [33] </ref>. The concept of real-time channel was first proposed in [13]. It is a simplex virtual connection with guaranteed quality of service (QOS). Two-way communications are supported by two such channels, one in each direction. The required QOS in real-time communications is typically in the form of delay time. <p> The network may accept or reject the request according to some admission policy. Once a channel is accepted, its QOS requirements should be guaranteed as long as the traffic generated by the user does not violate its specification. This concept is further extended in <ref> [33] </ref> to the FDDI network by the following definition. <p> major problem regarding real-time channels in FDDI networks is bandwidth allocation: what is the minimum amount of synchronous bandwidth required to support a real-time channel (T; C; d) so that all packets of this channel will be delivered (transmitted) within the delay constraint d? This problem has been studied in <ref> [1, 2, 8, 33] </ref> and several bandwidth allocation schemes have been proposed, all of which generate only approximate, as opposed to optimal, solutions. We will adopt the scheme of [33], which is able to generate optimal solutions for many problem instances. <p> We will adopt the scheme of <ref> [33] </ref>, which is able to generate optimal solutions for many problem instances. Definition 2 A real-time channel (T; C; d) that has been allocated an amount h of synchronous bandwidth will be referred to as (T; C; d; h). There are soft and hard real-time communications. <p> done with the leftover packets, will it be able to deliver them within the delay constraint? The answer is negative as explained below. 4.4.1 Delay Problem Let h denote the amount of synchronous bandwidth allocated to the channel (T; C; d) as calculated by Zheng and Shin's bandwidth allocation scheme <ref> [33] </ref>. Let L be the total amount of leftover packets at the old BS. Suppose it takes M &gt; 1 token visits for the old BS to transmit these leftover data. Then, (M 1)h &lt; L M h. <p> Proof. Let t g be a packet generation time and t 0 i (i 1) be the token arrivals that transmit only those packets generated at or after t g . Bandwidth h allocated by any scheme, such as in <ref> [1, 2, 33] </ref>, ensures that all packets generated at or after t g will be transmitted without delay if t 0 i t g + (i + 1)TTRT h (2) If M = 1, t hf = t u . <p> All these packets were generated before the packets to be transmitted by the new BS. Therefore, t g LCT (t hf ) + ((M 0 1)h + h OH)T =C. To satisfy the throughput requirement, bandwidth h should be no less than (TTRT=T )C <ref> [33] </ref>. From these two observations, we have t g LCT (t hf ) + (M 0 1)TTRT + (h OH)T =C (8) The token arrivals t u+i (i 0) are the (M 0 + i)th token arrivals at the new BS after LCT (t hf ). <p> This problem has been studied in <ref> [1, 2, 33] </ref>. <p> We denote the bandwidth calculated by this algorithm as h b (T; C; d; h; t e ). To prove the correctness of the SBAE algorithm, we borrow the following notations from <ref> [33] </ref>: bxc 0 = the greatest integer less than or equal to x if x 0 0 if x &lt; 0 ( the smallest integer greater than x if x 0 0 if x &lt; 0 These functions are slightly different from the regular floor and ceiling functions. <p> Thus, for instance, 37 b2:5c 0 = 0, b2:5c 0 = 2, d2:5e 0 = 0, d2:5e 0 = 3, and d3e 0 = 4. (bxc 0 and dxe 0 are denoted in <ref> [33] </ref> as bxc + and dxe + , respectively.) Under the assumption that the ith token visit is no later than t g + (i + 1)TTRT h, it is shown in [33] that over any time period of t, the actual synchronous transmission time for a station that was allocated <p> 0, d2:5e 0 = 3, and d3e 0 = 4. (bxc 0 and dxe 0 are denoted in <ref> [33] </ref> as bxc + and dxe + , respectively.) Under the assumption that the ith token visit is no later than t g + (i + 1)TTRT h, it is shown in [33] that over any time period of t, the actual synchronous transmission time for a station that was allocated a bandwidth of h is no less than (t) = bt=TTRT 1c 0 h + ffi (t) (10) where ffi (t) is defined as below: ffi (t) = 0 if dt=TTRTe 0 <p> The work <ref> [33] </ref> proposes an algorithm, called the Zheng-Shin algorithm, for h that guarantees to meet the feasibility condition: d (t d)=T e C (t). <p> Under our new condition for t i , we show in the following theorem that the bandwidth allocated to the first token arrival may be less than h. This theorem is built on the result of <ref> [33] </ref>. Theorem 8 Let t g be the starting packet generation time of a real-time channel (T; C; d; s; h), where h is as calculated by the Zheng-Shin algorithm. <p> According to <ref> [33] </ref>, d (t d)=T e 0 C (t) (= 0 (t)). Now consider the case where the period t includes the time of the first token arrival (to the station). Assume that the station is allocated bandwidth h b at the first token arrival, and bandwidth h afterward. <p> By letting h b = ffi (d) ffi (d + t e ) or ffi (d) ffi (d + t e ) + h respectively in these two cases, it is not hard to verify that 0 (d) = (d). Since (d) C <ref> [33] </ref>, it follows that 0 (d) C. <p> The right-hand side of the equation is known to be no less than C <ref> [33] </ref>. Thus, 0 (d + kT ) 0 (d + (k 1)T ) C as well. From this and the induction base 0 (d) C, we have 0 (d + kT ) (k + 1)C for all k 1. Case 2. <p> From this and the induction base 0 (d) C, we have 0 (d + kT ) (k + 1)C for all k 1. Case 2. When d T + 2TTRT, the h as calculated by the Zheng-Shin algorithm satisfies h = (TTRT=T )C <ref> [33] </ref>. For any t 2TTRT, if h b = h (t e =T )C, then d (td)=T e 0 C ((t2TTRT 39 T )=T +1)C = (t2TTRT)C=T = ((t+t e )=TTRT3)h+h (t e =T )C b (t+t e )=TTRT2c 0 h+h b 0 (t). Case 3. <p> Since d 0 &lt; d, this bandwidth is certainly sufficient for our present case. Case 4. When 2TTRT &lt; d &lt; T + 2TTRT and T &lt; TTRT, we have h = dTTRT=T eC and d (t d)=T e 0 C A (t), according to <ref> [33] </ref>. With h b set to h, we have A (t) bt=TTRT 2c 0 h + h b (t + t e )=TTRT 2c 0 h + h b 0 (t), and thus d (t d)=T e 0 C 0 (t). Now suppose d &gt; 3TTRT t e . <p> 0 (t) is that of A (t) shifted to the right by an amount of TTRT t e .) The amount of bandwidth A (t) is sufficient for any channel whose delay constraint d satisfies 2TTRT &lt; d &lt; T + TTRT and whose packet generation starts at time zero <ref> [33] </ref>. Thus, the amount of bandwidth A 0 (t) is sufficient for any channel with delay time d 0 satisfying 2TTRT &lt; d 0 &lt; T + TTRT and packet generation starting at time TTRT t e . <p> The bandwidth h allocated to each channel was calculated by the Zheng-Shin algorithm <ref> [33] </ref>. The distribution of the h so obtained tended to center around its average (which happened to be 0.003 42 (a) centered channels (b) bi-modal channels ms), thus the name centered.
