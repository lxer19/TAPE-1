Abstract: As RHODOS is maturing, it is becoming increasingly important to have available a high resolution timer that can be used to evaluate differing policies as they are implemented. RHODOS currently operates on a Sun 3/50, of which little hardware information is officially known due to Sun Microsystems non-disclosure agreements. A third party high resolution timer has been used to provide a timing ability not present with the standard hardware.

Reference-contexts: As the granularity of the clock should be at least equivalent to the instruction cycle of the microprocessor it has been necessary to install a third party timer <ref> [Danzig and Melvin 1991] </ref> based on an AMD9513. This timer module installs into the vacant DES socket on the Sun 3/50 motherboard and is addressed in the same technique as for the DES chip. Thus when RHODOS is operating this hardware device is used solely for high performance time stamping.

Reference-contexts: They are: the microprocessor instruction cache; the video refresh circuitry; and the sampling characteristics of the high precision counter. 2.1.1 Microprocessor Instruction Cache A feature of the Motorola 68020 microprocessor is the inclusion of 64 longs (256 bytes) of instruction cache <ref> [Motorola 1985] </ref>. When the cache is enabled and the processor is performing a load of an instruction, a check is first made to determine if the instruction is currently in the cache.

Reference-contexts: General conclusions from the obtained results are presented in Section 4. A brief description as to the applicability of various options is also included. 2 Analysing the Sun 3/50 workstation and timing software To generate measurements on the RHODOS operating system, a method known as event driven software sampling <ref> [Wickham 1994] </ref> will be used. This technique involves placing various checkpoints logically within the operating system, and when program execution passes one of these points a timestamp is generated and stored.
