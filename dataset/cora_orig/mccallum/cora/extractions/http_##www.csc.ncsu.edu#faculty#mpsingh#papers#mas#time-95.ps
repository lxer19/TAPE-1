Abstract: The formalization of actions is essential to AI. Several approaches have been proposed over the years. However, most approaches concentrate on the causes and effects of actions, but do not give general characterizations of actions themselves. A useful formalization of actions would be based on a general, possibly nondiscrete, model of time that allows branching (to capture agents' choices). A good formalization would also allow actions to be of arbitrary duration and would permit multiple agents to act concurrently. We develop a branching-time framework that allows great flexibility in how time and action are modeled. We motivate and formalize several coherence constraints on our models, which capture some nice intuitions and validate some useful inferences relating actions with time.

Reference-contexts: Our framework allows (a) time to branch to model agents' choices, (b) multiple agents to act simultaneously, (c) actions to be of varying durations relative to one another, and (d) time to be nondiscrete. Thus choice and control can be properly captured in this framework. Our approach is nonreified <ref> [ Bacchus et al., 1989 ] </ref> , as is common in the non-AI literature [ Emerson, 1990 ] . Time can variously be modeled as linear or branching. Allen presents an interval-based linear-time theory of actions in [ 1984 ] .

Reference-contexts: Thus choice and control can be properly captured in this framework. Our approach is nonreified [ Bacchus et al., 1989 ] , as is common in the non-AI literature <ref> [ Emerson, 1990 ] </ref> . Time can variously be modeled as linear or branching. Allen presents an interval-based linear-time theory of actions in [ 1984 ] . Turner (p. 88) and Shoham [ 1988, ch. 2 ] show that Allen's theory is not conceptually clear, especially with regard to intervals. <p> However, he cannot choose between t 1 and t 2 , or between t 3 and t 4 . Both choice and limited control are thus captured. 2.1 The Formal Language We use a qualitative temporal language, L, based on CTL* <ref> [ Emerson, 1990 ] </ref> . This captures the essential properties of actions and time that are of interest. Formally, L is the minimal set closed under the following rules. <p> We say p is satisfiable iff for some M and t, M j= t p. The satisfaction conditions for the temporal operators are adapted from those in <ref> [ Emerson, 1990 ] </ref> . It is assumed that each action symbol is quantified over at most once in any formula. Below, pj a b is the formula resulting from the substitution of all occurrences of a in p by b. <p> In other words, L and L 0 represent the same trajectory in state-space. For a model to represent a physical system and be specifiable by a transition relation among different states, the corresponding set of scenarios, S, must satisfy the following closure properties <ref> [ Emerson, 1990 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: One class of reasoning techniques that is likely to prove of much value is the one developed in the qualitative reasoning community, which routinely deals with continuous phenomena and looks for ways to express them in terms of significant transitions <ref> [ Kuipers, 1986; Sandewall, 1989 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: This is useful since AI models must often function at multiple levels of abstraction. We also discovered that several constraints must be stated on models to capture the AI notion of basic actions. The sole traditional constraint of no overlap <ref> [ McDermott, 1982 ] </ref> says too little and sometimes is too strong. Even though several decision procedures are known for CTL*, no closed-form axiomatization is still known. This is an important open problem, as is determining an axiomatization for our language, L.

Reference-contexts: When actions are modeled restrictively, the technical results obtained on the above concepts end up with potentially superfluous or even pernicious restrictions. It is easy to obtain spurious results on the above concepts that rely on some irrelevant aspect of the underlying model of actions <ref> [ Singh, 1992 ] </ref> . Our main interest is in formalizing the above concepts, but we must model actions properly to succeed [ Singh, 1994 ] . We introduce this formalization to the temporal representation community here. <p> Or model can thus serve as an underpinning for further research on notions such as intentions and know-how. Previous research on these concepts has been shackled by poor models of time and action, thereby leading to spurious results <ref> [ Singh, 1992 ] </ref> . The logic CTL* was designed over a decade ago for reasoning about programs. Usually, its models are discrete with unit length actions performed one at a time.
