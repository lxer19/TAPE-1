Title: Conceptual Data Model with Structured Objects for Statistical Databases

Abstract: In this paper we present a conceptual data model, called SDM, which is able to represent the relationships between elementary and statistical data at a conceptual level. SDM borrows elements from research both in Object Oriented Databases and in Knowledge Representation. In addition it has suitable mechanisms to form classes of individuals by classifying the instances of a target class according to some specified criteria. Notably, the class resulting from such a statistical aggregation can then be treated exactly as a class of elementary data. This ability fulfills the often perceived necessity, in modeling real domains, of treating statistical aggregates and elementary data in an homogeneous way.

Reference-contexts: The structure fT g represents sets of elements having structure T . Additionally, by means of ^, _, and :, we are allowed not only to include intersection and union in structure expressions (as in <ref> [1] </ref>), but also to refer to all objects that do not have a certain structure. Note that often object oriented models make, either explicitly or implicitly, the assumption that every object belongs to exactly one "most specific class". <p> Under this assumption, intersection can be eliminated from the schema definition since if an object is an instance of two classes, the schema also contains a class that specializes both and of which the object is an instance <ref> [1] </ref>. In contrast, in BDM we do not want to enforce the "most specific class assumption", consistently with most knowledge representation formalisms [4] and semantic data models [13].

Reference-contexts: Generally conceptual models bypass this kind of semantical relationships going directly to numerical data, which in fact should be attributes of the conceptual entities derived from the classification, entities that they are not able to represent explicitly. For example this happens when the Entity Relationship Model <ref> [9, 2] </ref> is used to model summary data [3]. Instead a conceptual statistical data model extends a conceptual model by allowing it to represent explicitly such statistical aggregates.
