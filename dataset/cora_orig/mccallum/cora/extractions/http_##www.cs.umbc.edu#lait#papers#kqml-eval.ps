Abstract: This chapter discusses the desirable features of languages and protocols for communication among intelligent information agents. These desiderata are dividedintosevencategories: form, content, semantics,implementation, networking, environment, and reliability. The Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) is a new language and protocol for exchanging information and knowledge. This work is part of a larger effort, the ARPA Knowledge Shar-ingEffort,whichis aimedat developingtechniques andmethodologies for building large-scale knowledge bases that are sharable and reusable. KQML is both a message formatanda message-handlingprotocolto supportrun-timeknowledge sharing among agents. KQML is described and evaluated as an agent communication language relative to the desiderata.

Reference-contexts: Three broad sub-categories may be identified under the label of agent communication languages: models of human communication, theoretical frameworks, and communication languages for software agents. Human communication is traditionally modeled in terms of speech act theory <ref> [2, 28] </ref>. Considerable work has been done (e.g., Cohen and Lesveque [5], Singh [32]) to capture the assumptions and conventions of interaction between human agents and subsequently translate them into workable paradigms for the development of their artificial counterparts.

Reference-contexts: We have found the basic primitives to be sufficient to create agents that offer network-oriented services, such as name servers, proxy agents and brokers.

Reference-contexts: Three broad sub-categories may be identified under the label of agent communication languages: models of human communication, theoretical frameworks, and communication languages for software agents. Human communication is traditionally modeled in terms of speech act theory [2, 28]. Considerable work has been done (e.g., Cohen and Lesveque <ref> [5] </ref>, Singh [32]) to capture the assumptions and conventions of interaction between human agents and subsequently translate them into workable paradigms for the development of their artificial counterparts. Often, such work leads to theoretical frameworks for artificial agents with human-like capabilities [6, 31].

Reference-contexts: Often, such work leads to theoretical frameworks for artificial agents with human-like capabilities <ref> [6, 31] </ref>. Such frameworks attempt to account for all aspects of the internal state of an artificial autonomous agent, with a particular attention to how this state changes as the agent interacts (and/or communicates) with the world or with other agents. <p> Semantics KQML semantics is still an open issue. For now there are only natural language descriptions of the intended meaning of the performatives and their use (i.e., protocols). An approach that emphasizes the speech act flavor of the communicative acts is a thread of ongoing research <ref> [18, 33, 6] </ref>. Labrou and Finin [18] have proposed a specific framework for KQML that defines cognitive states for agents and uses them to describe the performative and associated preconditions, postconditions and satisfiability conditions for felicitous use.

Reference-contexts: Interoperability with other communication languages remains to be addressed as such languages appear. One such attempt has been made by Davis, whose Agent-K <ref> [8] </ref> attempts to join KQML with Shoham's Agent Oriented Programming [29]. The existence of facilitators in the KQML environment can provide the means for knowledge discovery in large networks, especially if facilitators can cooperate with other knowledge discovery applications available in the World Wide Web.

Reference-contexts: The efficiency of KQML communication has been investigated. Various compression enhancements have been added that cut communication costs by reducing message size, and by eliminating a substantial fraction of symbol lookup and string duplication <ref> [11] </ref>. Networking KQML does address most of the networking desiderata and provides, we believe, a good fit with current networking technology. KQML has been designed to work with multiple transport mechanisms, and implementations have been done that use TCP/IP, SMTP (email), HTTP and CORBA objects to carry messages.

Reference-contexts: The Interlingua Group is developing a common language for expressing the content of a knowledge-base. This group has published a specification document describing the Knowledge Interchange Formalism or KIF <ref> [14] </ref>, which is based on first-order logic with extensions to support non-monotonic reasoning and definitions. KIF provides both a specification for the syntax of a language, and a specification for its semantics.

Reference-contexts: Terms in this ontology could be used in the :content field of the rudimentary error and sorry performatives to describe the problem encountered. The issues of security and authentication are only beginning to be addressed by the KQML community. A security architecture model <ref> [34] </ref> based on data encryption techniques has been proposed for KQML. In tune with KQML's asynchronous nature, the model expects a secure message to be self authenticating and does not support any challenge/response mechanism to authenticate a message after it has been delivered.
