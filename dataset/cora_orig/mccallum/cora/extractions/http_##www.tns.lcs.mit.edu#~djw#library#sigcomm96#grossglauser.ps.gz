Abstract: There is mounting experimental evidence that network traf tc processes exhibit ubiquitous properties of self-similarity and long range dependence (LRD), i.e. of correlations over a wide range of time scales. However, there is still considerable debate about how to model such processes and about their impact on network and application performance. In this paper, we argue that much recent modeling work has failed to consider the im pact of two important parameters, namely the tnite range of time scales of interest in performance evaluation and prediction problems, and the trst-order statistics such as the marginal dis tribution of the process. We introduce and evaluate a model in which these parameters can be easily controlled. Specitcally, our model is a modu lated uid trac model in which the correlation function of the uid rate is asymptotically second-order self-similar with given Hurst parameter, then drops to zero at a cuto time lag. We develop a very ecient numerical procedure to eval uate the performance of the single server queue fed with the above uid input process. We use this procedure to examine the uid loss rate for a wide range of marginal distributions, Hurst parameters, cuto lags, and buer sizes. Our main results are as follows. First, we tnd that the amount of correlation that needs to be taken into account for perfor mance evaluation depends not only on the correlation structure of the source trac, but also on time scales specitc to the sys tem under study. For example, the time scale associated to a queueing system is a function of the maximum buer size. Thus for tnite buer queues, we tnd that the impact on loss of the correlation in the arrival process becomes nil beyond a time scale we refer to as the correlation horizon. Second, we tnd that loss depends in a crucial way on the marginal distribution of the uid rate process. Third, our results suggest that reduc ing loss by buering is hard. We advocate the use of source trac control and statistical multiplexing instead. Copyright c fl1996 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

However, we believe that not enough work has considered the impact of parameters other than the correlation struc ture of the trac. Consider for example the asymptotic behavior of an intnite queue fed with three dierent ar rival processes that all exhibit the LRD property. <p> Second, if the arrival process is a single on/o source with heavy-tailed on and o periods, then the queue length distribution is hyperbolic. Third, if the arrival process is a single on/o source in which the o periods only are heavy-tailed, then the queue length distribution decays exponentially <ref> [6, 26] </ref>. Thus, processes with the same correlation structure can gen erate vastly dierent queueing behavior. Therefore, it is im portant to consider parameters other than the correlation of the input process for accurate performance prediction.

Reference-contexts: Second, if the arrival process is a single on/o source with heavy-tailed on and o periods, then the queue length distribution is hyperbolic. Third, if the arrival process is a single on/o source in which the o periods only are heavy-tailed, then the queue length distribution decays exponentially <ref> [6, 26] </ref>. Thus, processes with the same correlation structure can gen erate vastly dierent queueing behavior. Therefore, it is im portant to consider parameters other than the correlation of the input process for accurate performance prediction. <p> This is in agreement with results obtained by others using analytic approaches re garding the impact of the marginal distribution on the tail of the queue occupancy in intnite buers (e.g <ref> [26] </ref>). The second consequence relates to multiplexing. Our result above, namely that superposing even a moderate number of streams sharply decreases the loss rate, indicates that statistical multiplexing is an ecient mechanism (more so than buering) to achieve high utilization while keeping loss low.

Reference-contexts: This behavior has also been contrmed through simulation [11]. On the other hand, the literature on Markov modeling re ports good performance prediction for tnite buer systems even when input trac streams are correlated over many time-scales <ref> [10, 15, 29] </ref>. However, the contradiction is only apparent. Indeed, the existence of a tnite buer queue sets a limit on the memory of the system.

Reference-contexts: Another approach has been to use stochastic models (such as fractional Brown ian motion [24], zero-rate renewal processes <ref> [30] </ref> and various other point processes [28]) or deterministic models (such as chaotic maps [12]) that exhibit the LRD observed in the experimental data. However, these models are analytically dicult to handle. Furthermore, they do not provide much insight into why they are meaningful on physical grounds.

Reference-contexts: This explains in part that much modeling work still relies on more traditional multi-state Markovian models (e.g. [22, 2]). However, recent work has shown that the superposition of many on/o sources with heavy-tailed on- and o-periods results in aggregate trac with LRD <ref> [31, 6] </ref>. Furthermore, there is widespread evidence that human as well as computer sources of trac do tend to behave as heavy tailed on/o sources [7, 20, 31]. Thus, LRD in network trac can be ex plained simply in terms of the nature of the trac generated by individual sources. <p> However, recent work has shown that the superposition of many on/o sources with heavy-tailed on- and o-periods results in aggregate trac with LRD [31, 6].
