Title: Image Metamorphosis using Multiple Triangulations  
Author: Mihail Makarov Kikuo Fujimura 
Keyword: 2D painting and drawing, image manipulation.  
Abstract: An image metamorphosis method is proposed based on triangulation on image features. Image warping using triangulation has been criticized as suffering from foldover, locality, and piecewise linear problems. The proposed method improves upon all the three problems. The method is guaranteed to generate one-to-one mapping regardless of feature movements and permits point, line, and polygon features. Moreover, the proposed method can control areas of influence of feature points and the mapping can be made almost everywhere C 1 continuous. Image warping is constructed by considering multiple triangulations that are defined over the image in spatial as well as temporal dimensions. Experimental results are presented using synthetic images.

Reference-contexts: Their mapping is shown to be one-to-one, as long as feature movements do not exceed a certain limit. At times, scattered data interpolation methods such as multiquadrics are used for image warping <ref> [1, 13] </ref>. In this method, it is easy to incorporate radius of influence for each feature point, although one-to-one mapping is not necessarily guaranteed. The simplest method for scattered data interpolation would be to use triangulation for a given set of feature points. <p> The numbers near the vertices indicate the ordering in which the vertices are visited in procedure Triangulate. Fig. 3 (d,e) contain the area of influence of vertex (marked as 5 in (a)). Unlike methods using radial basis functions <ref> [1] </ref>, a vertex has a polygonal area of influence in our method. <p> The final observation that we make is that if, for every t 2 [0; t fl ], and every subregion S l;m;n;i;j;k the mapping l;m;n;i;j;k ff;t (ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) is 1-1, then, for any t 2 [0; t fl ], the mapping D ff;t is an isomorphism. Indeed, when t changes from 0 to t fl , the subregions change continuously.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 contains concluding remarks. 2 Prior Work A number of image and shape morphing methods have been proposed in the past several years. In earlier image morphing methods, point features organized in a rectilinear mesh [16] are used to define correspondence between two images.

Their approach, which is based on line features as opposed to point features, is claimed to provide more intuitive control for human users. This approach has lately been extended to 3D [10].

Reference-contexts: The simplest method for scattered data interpolation would be to use triangulation for a given set of feature points. Using piecewise linear or cubic functions for interpolating triangular patches has been proposed for image registration <ref> [5] </ref>. These methods work best when two images admit the same triangulation, since otherwise the warped image can contain wrinkles. An energy minimization approach [8] has been proposed to construct a one-to-one morph function by associating an energy term to morphing. Flexible templates are also used primarily for image matching.

Reference-contexts: By the third condition, no point in the image is permitted to jump abruptly from one location to another during the deformation. Intuitively, the image changes continuously without foldover. The 1 process descirbed as above is at times referred to as a rubber-band deformation or isotopic deformation <ref> [11] </ref>. The objective of this paper is to construct such a morph function. In addition, we describe a method for making the morph function C 1 continuous almost everywhere in the image. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: Triangulation-based methods are attractive in that mappings are one-to-one for small changes in feature movements and that they can incorporate various types of features including points, lines, and polylines in a natural manner. However, it has also been pointed out <ref> [13] </ref> that triangulation-based methods suffer from the following problems. * Foldover problems. One of the triangles could flip if a feature motion is not small enough. When a flip happens, the mapping becomes many-to-one, which distorts the part of the image severely. * Locality problem. <p> Their mapping is shown to be one-to-one, as long as feature movements do not exceed a certain limit. At times, scattered data interpolation methods such as multiquadrics are used for image warping <ref> [1, 13] </ref>. In this method, it is easy to incorporate radius of influence for each feature point, although one-to-one mapping is not necessarily guaranteed.
