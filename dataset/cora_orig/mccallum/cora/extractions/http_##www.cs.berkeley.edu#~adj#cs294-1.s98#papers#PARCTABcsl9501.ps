Title: The ParcTab Ubiquitous Computing Experiment  
Author: Roy Want, Bill N. Schilit, Norman I. Adams, Rich Gold, Karin Petersen, David Goldberg, John R. Ellis and Mark Weiser 
Abstract: The PARCTAB system integrates a palm-sized mobile computer into an office network. This project serves as a preliminary testbed for Ubiquitous Computing, a philosophy originating at Xerox PARC that aims to enrich our computing environment by emphasizing context sensitivity, casual interaction and the spatial arrangement of computers. This paper describes the Ubiquitous Computing philosophy, the PARCTAB system, user-interface issues for small devices, and our experience developing and testing a variety of mobile applications.

Reference-contexts: Finally, small cells enable the system to pin down a user's location to the resolution of a room. The tab infrared network <ref> [ 1; 27 ] </ref> thus consists of nanocells defined by the walls of a room surrounding an IR transceiver. Large open rooms and hallways may also support nanocells if transceivers are carefully placed out of communication range of each other.

Reference-contexts: More recent work at the University of Toronto has taken this work further and combined Ubiquitous Computing with video in a reactive environment <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> . An application that pushes the PARCTAB's communication abilities to their limits is media windowing. An otherwise unused IR channel can transmit one low-resolution frame of slow-scan video in about 1.5 seconds.

Reference-contexts: Because IR signals are contained by the walls of a room, this technology also made it easier to design a cellular system. Moreover, IR communication is unregulated. A radio link would have required more space, higher power equipment and potentially government operating licenses. We decided that a cellular system <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> would best handle the competition for bandwidth that inevitably would arise in a building-wide system supporting many users. By creating small, room-sized communication cells (nanocells), we could minimize the communication distance from the hub to the mobile user, reducing power needs concomitantly.

Reference-contexts: The Liveboard is not mobile and connects directly to an Ethernet.

We have also investigated how operating system design can reduce power consumption [ 43 ] and this is well suited to mobile computers.

Reference-contexts: If a program is already intended for remote use and has a network interface, controlling it with a PARCTAB is very easy. 7.4.2 X10 Remote Control Another UbiquitousComputing project at Xerox PARC, the Responsive Environment Project <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> , has been exploring how environmental control can save energy during the day-to-day operation of a building.

Reference-contexts: The beacon is a signal transmitted every 30 seconds, even when the device is idling in low-power mode, that allows the system to continue to monitor a PARCTAB's location when it is not active.

Reference-contexts: The PARCTAB e-mail application could be extended to use context to generate filters for displaying messages or notifying users of incoming mail. For example, all messages might be delivered while a user is alone, but only urgent ones would be delivered during a conference. In related work <ref> [ 13 ] </ref> a query language has been used to filter incoming mail. 7.2.1 Locator and Pager Operation The PARCTAB system inherently provides a locator system, assuming that the person who needs to be found is carrying a PARCTAB.

Reference-contexts: Each offered different levels of access to the PARCTAB and its capabilities. 6.1 Modula-3 Modula-3 was a natural choice to build the first PARCTAB applications because it is also the language for the PARCTAB's system software <ref> [ 22 ] </ref> . It had many characteristics that recommend it for both tasks, along with a number of shortcomings. 6.1.1 Modula-3 and System Development Modula-3 is a relatively new language; it has a number of features that we believe are valuable in building large systems. <p> Programmers can use these interfaces to examine and set parameters, and to restart components. The IR-gateway, for example, has extensive commands for checking the status of the transceiver hardware. 20 6.2 Code Libraries We implemented a class-based hierarchy of composable widgets, loosely modeled on the Trestle window toolkit <ref> [ 22 ] </ref> , to provide routine components such as iconic and text buttons, scrollbars, bitmaps, text labels, scrollable text areas, and dialog boxes. The PARCTAB's very small screen generally precludes overlapping of widgets, so our widgets do not need to do the clipping required by a conventional window system.

We created the Tshell [ 25 ] , a PARCTAB-shell extended with a Tcl interpreter and a subset of Tk <ref> [ 24 ] </ref> , thus providing both a scripting language that supports remote communication and a windowing toolkit. The choice of Tcl/Tk over other extension languages was based mostly on three reasons: 1. Tcl/Tk is widely used. 2.

Reference-contexts: new transceiver address. 4 USER-INTERFACE DESIGN FOR PALM-SIZED COMPUTERS As we developed applications for the PARCTAB, it became clear that a traditional user interface designed for the 640 x 480-pixel color display of a typical PC or workstation would not work well on the PARCTAB's 128 x 64-pixel monochrome display <ref> [ 26; 42 ] </ref> . Indeed, the PARCTAB's tiny screen, offering less than half the area of most PDA displays, forced us to devise innovative ways to select, display and enter information in a very limited space.

Reference-contexts: Even if the PARCTAB moves to a new cell, its agent will soon receive a beacon signal and update the tab's location accordingly. Whenever the tab's location or status changes, the agent notifies a centralized location service <ref> [ 29 ] </ref> of the tab's last known location and its status: interactive if it is being used, idle if it is transmitting beacons but no other events, and missing if the tab is out of sight. 17 An agent also manages which application is allowed access to its tab at

Reference-contexts: In a multiple-access network this type of acknowledgment is quite reliable, since the fact that the request was received implies that there was no contention and therefore the acknowledgment should also not encounter contention <ref> [ 36 ] </ref> . A PARCTAB sets the request bit for some types of tab packetsuser events, for exampleand then, if no acknowledgment arrives, resends the packet a fixed number of times until finally generating an audible alarm to the user.

Reference-contexts: These will prob ably be stationary devices analogous to whiteboards today. 2.3 Ubiquitous Computing Experiments at PARC Researchers at PARC have built computer systems at the three scales described above <ref> [ 41 ] </ref> : inch PARCTAB, a palm-sized computer; foot PARCPAD, an electronic notepad; yard Liveboard, an electronic whiteboard. 3 These experimental devices use different mechanisms for communication and compu-tation within the building's distributed system. The Liveboard is not mobile and connects directly to an Ethernet.

Reference-contexts: new transceiver address. 4 USER-INTERFACE DESIGN FOR PALM-SIZED COMPUTERS As we developed applications for the PARCTAB, it became clear that a traditional user interface designed for the 640 x 480-pixel color display of a typical PC or workstation would not work well on the PARCTAB's 128 x 64-pixel monochrome display <ref> [ 26; 42 ] </ref> . Indeed, the PARCTAB's tiny screen, offering less than half the area of most PDA displays, forced us to devise innovative ways to select, display and enter information in a very limited space.

Reference-contexts: The Liveboard is not mobile and connects directly to an Ethernet. Our mobile devices extend battery life by using low-power communication technologies: infrared (IR) signalling for the PARCTAB and near-field radio [ 8 ] for the PARCPAD. We have also investigated how operating system design can reduce power consumption <ref> [ 43 ] </ref> and this is well suited to mobile computers. The PARCPAD and Liveboard are described elsewhere by Kantarjiev [ 17; 12 ] and Elrod [ 9 ] .
