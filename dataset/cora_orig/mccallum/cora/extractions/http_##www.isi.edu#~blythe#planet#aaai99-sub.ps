Title: PLANET: A Shareable and Reusable Ontology for Representing Plans

Abstract: Ontologies are becoming a recognizedvehicle for knowledge reuse, knowledge sharing,and modeling. This paper presents PLANET, an ontology for representing plans. To show that PLANET is a comprehensive ontology that can be reused to build new applications, we describe several specializations of it to represent plans in three different real-world domains that were made by adding minor extensions to PLANET's general definitions and classes. In past work, we have developed several plan evaluation systems in these domains, and have integrated them in several occasions with plan editors and plan generation systems. For each of these integrations, and often for each system in the integration, a new format for exchanging plans was devised. PLANET can represent all of the plans that we and others have used in these domains, providing a standard universal format for knowledge sharing that can be used as an interlingua in integrated planning applications. Finally, the paper discusses how we have used PLANET as a knowledge modelling tool to design representations for courses of action in a military domain, guiding us to make useful distinctions and modelling choices.

Reference-contexts: Different systems that reason about plans (planners, schedulers, multi-agent systems, execution environments) use different approaches to representing and reasoning about these entities. Separate ontologies for these can be developed and integrated with PLANET. We use PLANET in combination with an ontology of Allen's time relations <ref> (Allen 1983) </ref> and the OZONE resource ontology (Smith, Lassila, & Becker 1996). We are also using PLANET in combination with an ontology of plan evaluations and critiques that we have developed for our work.

Reference-contexts: These difficulties are in part because these systems include decision-support tools such as plan editors, plan evaluation tools, and plan critiquers <ref> (Bienkowski and Hoebel 1998) </ref>, which represent plans in ways that are different from traditional AI plan generation systems.

Reference-contexts: Introduction As we develop larger and more complex intelligent systems in knowledge-intensive domains, it becomes impractical and even infeasible to develop knowledge bases from scratch. Recent research investigates how to develop intelligent systems by drawing from libraries of reusable components that include both ontologies <ref> (Neches et al. 1991) </ref> and problem-solving methods (Breuker and Van de Velde 1994). This paper introduces PLANET 1 , a reusable ontology for representing plans.

Reference-contexts: The planning knowledge represented in these languages can be mapped into PLANET. PLANET also accomodates plans that are not created by AI planning systems, and provides a representation for the context of the planning problems that are given to these systems. SPAR <ref> (Tate 1998) </ref> is an ongoing effort to create a standard vocabulary to describe plans that is compatible with other standards, such as the Process Interchange Format (PIF). SPAR currently comprises a set of textual statements that will be used to develop the model.
