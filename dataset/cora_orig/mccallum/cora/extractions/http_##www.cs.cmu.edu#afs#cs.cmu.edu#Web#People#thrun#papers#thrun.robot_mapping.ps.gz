Abstract: Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two major paradigms for mapping indoor environments: grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods produce accurate metric maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much more efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are considerably difficult to learn in large-scale environments. This paper describes an approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using artificial neural networks and Bayesian integration. Topological maps are generated on top of the grid-based maps, by partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By combining both paradigmsgrid-based and topological, the approach presented here gains the best of both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency. The paper gives results for autonomously operating a mobile robot equipped with sonar sensors in populated multi-room environments.

Reference-contexts: Throughout this paper, we will restrict ourselves to the interpretation of sonar sensors, although the methods described here have (in a prototype version) also been operated using cameras and infrared light sensors in addition to sonar sensors, using the image segmentation approach described in <ref> (Buhmann et al. 1995) </ref>. The approach proposed here has extensively been tested in various indoor environments, and is now distributed commercially by a leading mobile robot Bonn), XAVIER, and AMELIA (both CMU). manufacturer (Real World Interface, Inc.) as part of the regular navigation software.

Reference-contexts: Once value iteration converges, greedy exploration simply amounts to steepest descent in the value function, which can be done very efficiently. Figure 5b, sketches the path taken during approximately 15 minutes of autonomous exploration. The value function can, however, be used to generate motion control at any time <ref> (Dean & Boddy 1988) </ref>, long before dynamic programming converges.

Reference-contexts: Each grid-cell hx; yi in the map has an occupancy value attached, which measures the subjective belief whether or not the center of the robot can be moved to the center of that cell (i.e., the occupancy map models the configuration space of the robot, see e.g., <ref> (Latombe 1991) </ref>). This section describes the four major components of our approach to building grid-based maps (see also (Thrun 1993)): (1) sensor interpretation, (2) integration, (3) position estimation, and (4) exploration. Examples of metric maps are shown in various places in this paper. <p> We will call these points the basis points of hx; yi, and the distance between hx; yi and its basis points the clearance of hx; yi. The Voronoi diagram <ref> (Latombe 1991) </ref> is the set of points in free-space that have at least two different (equidistant) basis-points (see Figure 6b). 3. Critical points. The key idea for partitioning the free-space is to find critical points. Critical points hx; yi are points on the Voronoi diagram that minimize clearance locally.

Reference-contexts: For example, fine-grain CAD models are often disadvantageous if actions must be generated in real-time. Recent research has produced two fundamental paradigms for modeling indoor robot environments: the grid-based (metric) paradigm and the topological paradigm. Grid-based approaches, such as those proposed by Moravec/Elfes <ref> (Moravec 1988) </ref> and many others, represent environments by evenly-spaced grids. Each grid cell may, for example, indicate the presence of an obstacle in the corresponding region of the environment.

Reference-contexts: Consistency The topological map is always consistent with the grid-based map. For every abstract plan generated using the topological map, there exists a corresponding plan in the grid-based map (in other words, the abstraction has the downward solution property <ref> (Russell & Norvig 1995) </ref>). Conversely, every path that can be found in the grid-based map has an abstract representation which is a admissible plan in the topological map (upward solution property).

Reference-contexts: Map correlation. Whenever the robot interprets an actual sensor reading, it constructs a local map (such as the ones shown in Figure 2). The correlation of the local and the corresponding section of the global map is a measure of their correspondence <ref> (Schiele & Crowley 1994) </ref>. Thus, the correlationwhich is a function of the robot positiongives a second source of information for estimating the robot's position. 3. Wall orientation. The third source of information estimates and memorizes the global wall orientation (Crow-ley 1989; Hinkel & Knieriemen 1988).

Reference-contexts: In fact, sonar sensors can be understood as landmark detectors that indirectlythrough the grid-based maphelp determine the actual position in the topological map (cf. <ref> (Simmons & Koenig 1995) </ref>). One of the key empirical results of this research concerns the cost-benefit analysis of topological representations. While grid-based maps yield more accurate control, planning with more abstract topological maps is several orders of magnitude more efficient.

Reference-contexts: Once the global wall orientation has been estimated, it is used to readjust the robot's orientation based on future sonar measurements. All three mechanisms basically provide a probability density for the robot's position <ref> (Thrun & Bucken 1996) </ref>. Gradient descent is then iterated to determine the most likely robot position (in an any-time fashion). <p> If a new path planning problem arrives, topological planning amounts to looking up the correct plan. The reader may also notice that topological plans often do not directly translate into motion commands. In <ref> (Thrun & Bucken 1996) </ref>, a local triplet planner is described, which generates cost-optimal plans for triplets of adjacent topological regions.
