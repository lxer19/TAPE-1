Author: David Raggett (Hewlett Packard)

Date: 12th July 1993  
Abstract: HTML+ is a simple SGML based format for wide-area hypertext documents, for use within the World Wide Web. Unlike desktop publishing formats, HTML+ captures the logical intent of authors. This simplifies the task of writing documents, and permits them to be effectively rendered on a wide range of display types as well as the printed page. HTML+ represents a substantial improvement over the existing format: HTML, offering nested lists, figures, embedded data in foreign formats for equations etc, tables with support for titles and column headings, change bars, entry forms for querying and updating information sources and for use as questionaires for mailing. This document specifies the HTML+ format with guidelines on how it should be rendered by browsers.

Reference-contexts: HTML+ and HyTime The HyTime standard provides a rich range of architectural forms, but is not aimed at runtime efficiency. Suggestions have been made as to how the HTML DTD could be adapted to comply with HyTime's clink architectural form <ref> [Kimber 93] </ref>. This would necessitate documents declaring links as external entities and the use of local names in link definitions, but in the absence of any immediate benefit, there has been little enthusiasm for this within the World Wide Web community.
