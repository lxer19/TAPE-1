Reference-contexts: Thus, E T is minimum among all E i ; i = 0; 1; :::; C and policy g T is optimal for problem MINOBJ. Consider the Limited Fractional Guard Channel policy f k;q := [g k1 ; g k ; q]; q 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> which admits new calls at state k 1 with probability q, and admits only handoff calls from states k through C. Let B h (u) and B n (u) be the handoff and new call blocking probabilities for a stationary (possibly randomized) policy u. <p> Hence f T;q , which randomizes between two optimal policies, is also optimal. 24 Theorem 2.6 If B h (g 0 ) P h B h (g C ), then for some q 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; j = minfi : B h (g i ) P h g; f j;q is optimal over all call admission control policies for the MIN-BLOCK problem. Proof: Suppose B h (g j1 ) P h B h (g j ) with j as given above. <p> Proof: Suppose B h (g j1 ) P h B h (g j ) with j as given above. By continuity of f j;q , 9q 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that B h (f j;q ) = P h . Moreover, f j;q minimizes J fl (u) where fl = A j by Lemma 2.5. <p> All this has to be achieved while keeping the update rates due to connection re-routing low so as not to overload the switches. Connection rerouting procedures for ATM-based wireless networks have been studied extensively <ref> [1, 22, 24, 31, 45, 51, 71, 73] </ref>. However, there has been very little experimental evaluation of the various rerouting procedures. In [71], rerouting is implemented such that there is no loss and very little disruption of user traffic. <p> On the other hand, if the mobile user is handed off to base-station BS3, the cross-over switch would be switch SW1 and a longer segment of the original connection would require rerouting. The footprint policies of <ref> [1] </ref> fall into this category. In [1], the switch hardware automatically detects that a mobile user has been handed off (from the fact that the data from the mobile user is now arriving through a different port) and effects a connection reroute. <p> On the other hand, if the mobile user is handed off to base-station BS3, the cross-over switch would be switch SW1 and a longer segment of the original connection would require rerouting.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION During the last few years there has been tremendous interest and progress in the field of multimedia wireless networks <ref> [2, 12, 17, 18, 19, 49, 62, 64, 65, 66, 75] </ref>. These wireless networks will provide users with the ability to communicate anytime, anywhere, and in any form [23]. This type of service can be provided, in theory, by the current cellular technology and infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: All this must be achieved while the number of the update messages at the network switches due to connection rerouting remains low. In Chapter 3, we propose, implement, and experimentally and analytically evaluate the performance of several connection rerouting policies. 1.1.3 User Agent Migration Policies Several researchers <ref> [3, 5, 34, 42, 59, 61] </ref> have proposed the notion of user agents, which reside in the fixed part of the network and act as proxies for mobile users. These agents have access to high bandwidth links and large computational resources. <p> When this intermediary server represents a particular mobile user, and performs actions on behalf of that mobile user, it is termed a "user agent". The need for such an agent inside the fixed network, acting on behalf of a mobile user, has been proposed by several researchers <ref> [3, 5, 34, 42, 32, 57] </ref>. Although agents themselves have received considerable attention, the issue of user agent mobility has received less attention to date. In many applications, this issue 80 has been resolved somewhat in an ad-hoc manner, based on the environment in which the application operates. <p> The authors motivate the need for an agent to introduce "indirect" interaction between clients and servers whenever the clients and servers are directly connected to drastically different communication media, e.g., the wired and wireless media. Such user agents have been utilized in several applications <ref> [3, 5, 34, 42, 32, 57, 59, 61] </ref>. The Berkeley Infopad project [34] has a pad server which manages and controls access to the mobile terminal. <p> Thus, remote memory is used as an "extended disk" to enable faster memory accesses as well as to circumvent problems due to lack of disk space in mobile computers. In the ParcTab network <ref> [3] </ref>, the agent is responsible for delivering requests to its corresponding mobile user and tracking the location of the mobile as it moves from cell to cell. <p> Applications always communicate with the mobile terminal through the proxy. A distinction can be made among the agents depending on whether they affect the control information or the data sent/received by the mobile user. For example, in <ref> [3, 5] </ref>, the agent processes the data flowing to the mobile user. The pad server in the Infopad project also performs multiplexing and demultiplexing operations on the data flowing to/from the mobile user.

Reference-contexts: Another important difference between the two problems is the impact of migration overhead. Since traditional process migration techniques <ref> [4, 53, 41] </ref> which implement load balancing in distributed systems are general purpose mechanisms, they result in considerable overhead in migration. In our case, we are migrating a specific process, the user agent.

The Berkeley Infopad project [34] has a pad server which manages and controls access to the mobile terminal. <p> The Teleporting system [59] is another interesting application that adopts the notion of agents. It uses proxy servers, a special type of X server, to make application interfaces (X displays) mobile. These proxy servers are instantiated for each user. In <ref> [5] </ref>, the agent is given the responsibility of storing and filtering messages. The ability to store messages is beneficial when the mobile computer is disconnected from the fixed network or operates in power-save mode. Filtering messages helps reduce the amount of data transferred over the wireless link. <p> Applications always communicate with the mobile terminal through the proxy. A distinction can be made among the agents depending on whether they affect the control information or the data sent/received by the mobile user. For example, in <ref> [3, 5] </ref>, the agent processes the data flowing to the mobile user.

Reference-contexts: We now look at the five rerouting policies in detail. Note that, in our implementations, we use signaling procedures that are not part of standard signaling protocols such as User-Network Interface (UNI 3.1) <ref> [6] </ref> or Signaling System No. 7 (SSN7) [29] since the signaling messages needed to perform connection rerouting have not yet been standardized.

Reference-contexts: The standardization process and the demand for tetherless access to services has led to a plethora of commercial products. In local area environments, products such as Lucent Technologies Wavelan <ref> [7] </ref> deliver 2Mb/s of raw throughput which results in 1 approximately 1.6 Mb/s of user throughput [9]. Recently, some vendors (Altair Plus II from Motorola) are even promising bandwidths upto 5.7 Mb/s. In wide area environments, cellular telecommunications and paging services have been the dominant applications so far.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we present a different proof for the optimality of the Guard Channel policy for the MINOBJ problem. An interesting consequence of our approach is that the Guard Channel policy is shown to be optimal for a discounted cost finite and infinite horizon problems as well <ref> [10] </ref>. First we note that equation (2.3) is a formulation for the average cost problem [10] with the cost of rejecting a handoff call being A 2 and the corresponding cost for new call rejection being A 1 . <p> An interesting consequence of our approach is that the Guard Channel policy is shown to be optimal for a discounted cost finite and infinite horizon problems as well <ref> [10] </ref>. First we note that equation (2.3) is a formulation for the average cost problem [10] with the cost of rejecting a handoff call being A 2 and the corresponding cost for new call rejection being A 1 . Let us consider the class of control policies that are stationary, i.e., depend only on the current state i, which we denote as u (i). <p> Before we proceed to the average cost problem, we first consider the following -discounted finite horizon problem <ref> [10] </ref>: min E ( N1 n=0 A 2 e T n 2 ) where is the discount factor and where T n 1 and T n 2 are the rejection times for the new and handoff calls respectively. <p> We discretize the discounted return problem above by using the standard uni-formization technique <ref> [10] </ref> and by scaling time, one can assume that C+ 1 + 2 + = 1. Let V k (i) denote the optimal cost for the k-stage problem starting in state i, where i denotes the number of allocated channels.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the few packets that the mobile host might have missed due to non-overlapping cells would be retransmitted to the mobile host. It would be interesting to implement this policy and verify this behavior experimentally. A similar solution has recently been adopted for handoff in IP networks <ref> [11] </ref>. Another issue that could be examined in detail, either through simulation or analysis, is the cost of signaling messages used by the rerouting protocols proposed in our work.

Reference-contexts: Recently, some vendors (Altair Plus II from Motorola) are even promising bandwidths upto 5.7 Mb/s. In wide area environments, cellular telecommunications and paging services have been the dominant applications so far. Two-way messaging services are currently in the process of large scale deployment while data services (e.g., CDPD <ref> [13] </ref>) are seeing increasing market penetration. Thus, technology is strategically placed for the introduction of advanced services in wireless networks. The architecture of a multimedia wireless network can be divided into wireless network segments, wired network segments and network processors. We now describe these three parts in detail.

Reference-contexts: These parameters can be determined at the base-station by having a running estimate of 27 the new and handoff call arrival rates using standard techniques such as exponential smoothing <ref> [14] </ref>. The handoff call arrival rates can also be deduced based on an expected new call arrival rate and some of the direct wireless network parameters that can be measured including the cell-size, and the speed and the average cell resident time of the mobile user.

However, to accommodate the growth rate of new subscribers to wireless services, control algorithms are needed to allocate and manage network resources in the presence of mobility.

Reference-contexts: While there exists some similarity between our problem of designing migration policies that "load balance" the execution of user agents and traditional distributed systems load balancing problems, there are two important differences. First, load balancing mechanisms in distributed systems <ref> [20, 21, 25, 67, 77] </ref> were designed so that 84 idle machines in a network of workstations could be profitably and transparently used. Thus, the choice of a processor on which to execute a process was primarily based on the load conditions in the processors.

The two additional policies we will consider are: * Count policy: In this policy, an upper limit (threshold, T ) is imposed on the maximum number of user agents that can be present in a processor at any given time. <p> However, such an analysis is only approximate when the number of neighbors to a given cell is finite and is only exact asymptotically as the number of neighbors goes to infinity <ref> [21] </ref>. However, our simulation results, presented later, indicate that the approximate analytic results are very close to the simulation estimates for the parameter value ranges in which we are interested in the case of a wireless network comprising of hexagonal/octagonal cells with 6/8 neighbors.

The authors in <ref> [22] </ref> propose a homing algorithm for routing ATM cells during handoff in a wireless ATM LAN. The essence of the algorithm lies in forwarding cells through a Home Station and is very similar to the chaining approach.

In [71], rerouting is implemented such that there is no loss and very little disruption of user traffic. <p> Given the simplicity of this policy (as well as of the other four policies we study), the broader implication of the result of this chapter is that complex connection rerouting policies, such as those proposed in <ref> [24, 31, 35] </ref>, are unnecessary for supporting connection rerouting for continuous media traffic in ATM-based wireless networks. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. <p> To provide ordered, loss-less delivery, resynchronization mechanisms and buffering at the base-station are essential. This leads to a very complex protocol involving the exchange of a dozen or more protocol messages to accomplish a handoff [31]. 3.2.3 Predictive handoff approaches Predictive approaches to connection rerouting were proposed in <ref> [24, 35] </ref>. The goal of a predictive approach is to minimize the impact of disruption in loss and delay-sensitive continuous media traffic. <p> Of course, this policy requires the maintenance of multiple connection paths to the mobile host and its current neighbors. Also, this policy entails the overhead 43 of buffering data for each mobile host in multiple base-stations. Various policies to minimize this overhead have been proposed <ref> [24] </ref>. 3.2.4 Chaining handoff approaches A chaining approach to connection rerouting in LANs has been proposed in [22, 45]. In [45], the authors argue that most of the movements of a mobile device connected to a LAN will be within a local domain.

Finally we present our conclusions in Section 2.7. 11 2.2 Survey of Related Work The notion of guard channels was introduced in the mid-80s <ref> [26, 52] </ref> as a call admission mechanism to give priority to handoff calls over new calls. In this policy, new and handoff calls are treated identically until a specified threshold number of channels are allocated. At this point, new calls are blocked and only handoff calls are allowed.

Thus, the agent serves the role of a Mobile Support Router of the Mobile IP scheme <ref> [28] </ref> which manages the routing for a specific mobile terminal. The framework developed in ParcTab is used in Wit [78], where the network proxy process 83 provides connections, and acts as an application programmer interface. Applications always communicate with the mobile terminal through the proxy.

Connection rerouting procedures for ATM-based wireless networks have been studied extensively <ref> [1, 22, 24, 31, 45, 51, 71, 73] </ref>. However, there has been very little experimental evaluation of the various rerouting procedures. In [71], rerouting is implemented such that there is no loss and very little disruption of user traffic. <p> Given the simplicity of this policy (as well as of the other four policies we study), the broader implication of the result of this chapter is that complex connection rerouting policies, such as those proposed in <ref> [24, 31, 35] </ref>, are unnecessary for supporting connection rerouting for continuous media traffic in ATM-based wireless networks. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. <p> For example, cells arriving at the switch while the switch is altering its routing entry may be dropped. 3.2.2 Ordered handoff approaches The goal of an ordered approach is to provide ordered, loss-less data delivery during handoffs. In <ref> [31] </ref>, the authors propose three different policies for connection rerouting: full reestablishment, incremental reestablishment and multicast-based reestablishment. Full reestablishment involves tearing down the old connection and establishing a new connection to the source upon handoff. <p> To provide ordered, loss-less delivery, resynchronization mechanisms and buffering at the base-station are essential. This leads to a very complex protocol involving the exchange of a dozen or more protocol messages to accomplish a handoff <ref> [31] </ref>. 3.2.3 Predictive handoff approaches Predictive approaches to connection rerouting were proposed in [24, 35]. The goal of a predictive approach is to minimize the impact of disruption in loss and delay-sensitive continuous media traffic.

Reference-contexts: If the mobile user is in an overlapping region between two or more cells, handoff calls may be delayed for a short duration before allocating a channel to the call. Several researchers <ref> [55, 36, 39] </ref> have exploited this idea and proposed policies wherein handoff calls are queued. In [68], the authors propose using a measurement based queueing scheme where handoff calls are prioritized so that the call which is on the verge of being disconnected is given the highest priority. <p> that need to be answered include how and how often to readjust the parameters of the Fractional policy and to study the impact of these adjustments on performance. 131 A third direction for future work is to examine the Fractional policy in the context of handoff and/or new call buffering <ref> [36] </ref>. In many cases, new calls can be accepted after a short waiting period while handoff calls can be accepted anytime within a degradation interval during which the mobile device listens to two or more neighboring base-stations.

Reference-contexts: The mobile user then moves to one of the neighboring cells with equal probability. These are fairly common assumptions for modeling user mobility in wide-area wireless environments and have been used in <ref> [38, 79] </ref>. Each user is represented by a network-based user agent as detailed in Section 4.3. We assume that the requests at the user agent arrive in a Poisson manner with rate c . <p> The simulator also serves as a basis for studying the behavior of a more complex wireless network (e.g., with migration overhead incorporated) which is difficult to study analytically. To simulate a very large network, the authors in <ref> [38] </ref> advocate a wrap-around topology. This approach eliminates the boundary effects in an un-wrapped topology. 98 It also results in a faster simulation since we need fewer cells to achieve high confidence intervals in the measured values.

In <ref> [39] </ref>, the authors evaluate the performance of several handoff policies: Non-prioritized Scheme (NPS), Reserved channel Scheme (RCS), Sub-Rating Scheme (SRS) and Queueing-based schemes. In NPS, both handoff calls and new calls are treated identically for channel allocation purposes. RCS is the same as setting aside guard channels for handoff calls. <p> If we assume that the cell duration time is exponentially distributed, we can derive the call handoff rates by solving a set of equations by repeated substitution <ref> [39] </ref>. Our main interest in this chapter is to examine the efficiency of call admission control policies and thus, we illustrate the efficacy of our algorithms on some of the new and handoff call arrival rates used in the literature. <p> The average load at the switch is now simply R fl t where t denotes the processing time for a request. To illustrate with an example, let the mean call holding time (1=) be 3 minutes and the mean cell resident time (1=) be 6 minutes (as used in <ref> [39] </ref>). Further, let the call arrival rate () at the network switch be 36000 calls/hr (10 calls/sec). The time for processing call arrivals, departures and updates is taken to be 40 milliseconds (the measured time for the make-break operation in our FORE ATM switch).

Reference-contexts: The call duration is exponentially distributed with mean 1=. The mobile user stays in a cell for a time duration that is an exponentially distributed random variable with mean 1= and then moves to a neighboring cell. These are common assumptions which have been used in <ref> [40, 52, 68] </ref>. We will now analytically evaluate the load at the switch assuming that B units of bandwidth is provisioned between all pairs of neighboring base-stations. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that all calls are homogeneous and require one unit of bandwidth. <p> Probability P i can be determined as <ref> [40] </ref> P i = f + g i1 ; i 1; + ; i = 0: Thus, h = fl 1 i=0 i fl P i = fl =. <p> If one takes into account the fact that new call attempts and handoff call attempts can be blocked due to lack of resources (either at the base-station or at the network), h can be evaluated by an iterative procedure as illustrated in <ref> [40] </ref>. We will proceed with the assumption that there is no blocking of initial call attempts since the relaxation of this assumption does not present us with further insights into the current analysis. <p> We also generate handoff events for each user such that the user spends an exponential amount of time with mean 1= r in each cell. The movement of the mobile users is based on the two-dimensional random walk model used in <ref> [40] </ref>. In this model, the mobile users move to one of their neighboring cells with equal probability. The simulator allows for 4,6, and 8 neighbors per cell for modeling rectangular, hexagonal, and octagonal cells respectively.

Reference-contexts: Multimedia wireless networks encompass many technologies, systems, and services optimized for a variety of applications [19]. Examples of applications include multimedia teleconferencing, electronic newspaper, and nomadic computing <ref> [45] </ref>. These applications are expected to operate over a variety of environments including Local Area Networks (LAN), corporate networks, and Wide Area Networks (WAN). <p> All this has to be achieved while keeping the update rates due to connection re-routing low so as not to overload the switches. Connection rerouting procedures for ATM-based wireless networks have been studied extensively <ref> [1, 22, 24, 31, 45, 51, 71, 73] </ref>. However, there has been very little experimental evaluation of the various rerouting procedures. In [71], rerouting is implemented such that there is no loss and very little disruption of user traffic. <p> Also, this policy entails the overhead 43 of buffering data for each mobile host in multiple base-stations. Various policies to minimize this overhead have been proposed [24]. 3.2.4 Chaining handoff approaches A chaining approach to connection rerouting in LANs has been proposed in <ref> [22, 45] </ref>. In [45], the authors argue that most of the movements of a mobile device connected to a LAN will be within a local domain. <p> Also, this policy entails the overhead 43 of buffering data for each mobile host in multiple base-stations. Various policies to minimize this overhead have been proposed [24]. 3.2.4 Chaining handoff approaches A chaining approach to connection rerouting in LANs has been proposed in [22, 45]. In <ref> [45] </ref>, the authors argue that most of the movements of a mobile device connected to a LAN will be within a local domain. <p> In this manner, the base-stations are "chained" together. The proponents of this approach argue that the extra delay incurred due to the new links will be insignificant, and the increased cost due to inefficient routing is minimal compared to the large bandwidth available in the wired network. In <ref> [45] </ref>, the authors propose loop detection to eliminate some route inefficiencies. Note that one still needs to perform rerouting when the chain grows too long or when a mobile device moves outside a local domain. One of the earlier mentioned policies could be used for this operation. <p> In addition, the handoff can be accomplished extremely fast (6.5 milliseconds in our implementation) if we preassign Virtual Channels (VC) between neighboring base-stations for handoff purposes. However, as discussed before, long "chains" will likely result in performance degradation for the connection, and inefficient routing in the wired network. In <ref> [45] </ref>, the authors propose loop-detection and elimination as an optimization that reduces network inefficiencies. Note that unlike the basic chaining procedure 66 itself, loop-elimination can result in packet loss without sophisticated synchroniza-tion and buffering policies.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION During the last few years there has been tremendous interest and progress in the field of multimedia wireless networks <ref> [2, 12, 17, 18, 19, 49, 62, 64, 65, 66, 75] </ref>. These wireless networks will provide users with the ability to communicate anytime, anywhere, and in any form [23]. This type of service can be provided, in theory, by the current cellular technology and infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: For example, user agents in [34] are placed at a fixed well known location (such as the mobile user's workstation) since the application operates in a campus area environment. Similarly, there is a concept of a home agent in the Mobile IP proposal <ref> [50] </ref>. On the other hand, user agents in [57] are migrated along with the mobile user since the application operates over a wide-area environment. When the user agents are fixed, appropriate initial placement of agents can help in balancing the load across the network servers.

Reference-contexts: All this has to be achieved while keeping the update rates due to connection re-routing low so as not to overload the switches. Connection rerouting procedures for ATM-based wireless networks have been studied extensively <ref> [1, 22, 24, 31, 45, 51, 71, 73] </ref>. However, there has been very little experimental evaluation of the various rerouting procedures. In [71], rerouting is implemented such that there is no loss and very little disruption of user traffic.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2.6, we consider the MINC problem and develop an algorithm for its solution. Finally we present our conclusions in Section 2.7. 11 2.2 Survey of Related Work The notion of guard channels was introduced in the mid-80s <ref> [26, 52] </ref> as a call admission mechanism to give priority to handoff calls over new calls. In this policy, new and handoff calls are treated identically until a specified threshold number of channels are allocated. At this point, new calls are blocked and only handoff calls are allowed. <p> This set of assumptions has been found to be reasonable as long as the number of mobile users in a cell is much greater than the number of channels and have been used in the models in <ref> [52, 68, 79] </ref>. <p> The state transition rate diagram of a cell with C channels and C T guard channels is shown in Figure 2 (a). Given this, it is straight forward to derive the steady-state probability P j , that j channels are busy <ref> [48, 52] </ref>: 1 One could possibly enhance the state description by keeping track of new calls and handoff calls separately, rather than the total occupancy alone. <p> Also, since we are only concerned with the connection rerouting aspect of a handoff, we use the terms handoff and connection rerouting interchangeably in the remainder of this chapter. We note that a system will perform a variety of other functions during a handoff including call admission control <ref> [52] </ref>, assigning frequency slots (in the case of a TDMA system [18]) or codes (in the case of a CDMA system [74]), power control, etc. These issues, however, are orthogonal to those considered here. <p> The call duration is exponentially distributed with mean 1=. The mobile user stays in a cell for a time duration that is an exponentially distributed random variable with mean 1= and then moves to a neighboring cell. These are common assumptions which have been used in <ref> [40, 52, 68] </ref>. We will now analytically evaluate the load at the switch assuming that B units of bandwidth is provisioned between all pairs of neighboring base-stations. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that all calls are homogeneous and require one unit of bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Another important difference between the two problems is the impact of migration overhead. Since traditional process migration techniques <ref> [4, 53, 41] </ref> which implement load balancing in distributed systems are general purpose mechanisms, they result in considerable overhead in migration. In our case, we are migrating a specific process, the user agent.

Reference-contexts: If the mobile user is in an overlapping region between two or more cells, handoff calls may be delayed for a short duration before allocating a channel to the call.

Reference-contexts: The network processors comprise the third component of the wireless multimedia network. User agents, which act as proxies for mobile users, execute in these network 2 processors. The user agents perform functions such as connection setup, negotiation, and filtering on behalf of the mobile user <ref> [57] </ref>. Placing appropriate functionality in the user agent helps provide customized services for the mobile user and also reduces usage of the wireless link. A typical multimedia wireless network with base-stations, network processors, and ATM switches is shown in Figure 1.1. The service area, partitioned into cells, is illustrated. <p> The focus of this dissertation is this important problem of supporting connection mobility through efficient management of resources. Since the connection resources can be divided into three domains comprising the wireless, wired and network server domains, we study the problem in each of these domains <ref> [56, 58, 57] </ref>. In the domain of wireless link resources, we examine and derive optimal call admission control algorithms for allocating wireless channel resources among mobile users. <p> When this intermediary server represents a particular mobile user, and performs actions on behalf of that mobile user, it is termed a "user agent". The need for such an agent inside the fixed network, acting on behalf of a mobile user, has been proposed by several researchers <ref> [3, 5, 34, 42, 32, 57] </ref>. Although agents themselves have received considerable attention, the issue of user agent mobility has received less attention to date. In many applications, this issue 80 has been resolved somewhat in an ad-hoc manner, based on the environment in which the application operates. <p> Similarly, there is a concept of a home agent in the Mobile IP proposal [50]. On the other hand, user agents in <ref> [57] </ref> are migrated along with the mobile user since the application operates over a wide-area environment. When the user agents are fixed, appropriate initial placement of agents can help in balancing the load across the network servers. <p> The authors motivate the need for an agent to introduce "indirect" interaction between clients and servers whenever the clients and servers are directly connected to drastically different communication media, e.g., the wired and wireless media. Such user agents have been utilized in several applications <ref> [3, 5, 34, 42, 32, 57, 59, 61] </ref>. The Berkeley Infopad project [34] has a pad server which manages and controls access to the mobile terminal. <p> The P-agent contains all the service logic and service data related to 82 the user, and controls the communication sessions. The MF-agent is assigned by the P-agent at remote locations. The MF-agent becomes the acting P-agent and provides services to the user. In <ref> [57] </ref>, the authors propose using a User Process to reduce signaling traffic over the wireless link. Supporting advanced applications like teleconferencing requires complex signaling and negotiation mechanisms. By terminating these messages at the User Process in the fixed network, a significant reduction in wireless traffic can be achieved [57]. <p> In <ref> [57] </ref>, the authors propose using a User Process to reduce signaling traffic over the wireless link. Supporting advanced applications like teleconferencing requires complex signaling and negotiation mechanisms. By terminating these messages at the User Process in the fixed network, a significant reduction in wireless traffic can be achieved [57]. The Teleporting system [59] is another interesting application that adopts the notion of agents. It uses proxy servers, a special type of X server, to make application interfaces (X displays) mobile. These proxy servers are instantiated for each user. <p> For example, in [3, 5], the agent processes the data flowing to the mobile user. The pad server in the Infopad project also performs multiplexing and demultiplexing operations on the data flowing to/from the mobile user. In <ref> [57] </ref>, the user process manages control information only, while the actual data path extends directly between the end systems, bypassing the user agent. In the research efforts discussed above, the issue of agent mobility has been resolved according to the needs of the particular application. <p> The Infopad architecture caters to campus users. Their design assumes a fixed agent. Similarly, the ParcTab network is an infrared network with room-sized cells designed for indoor operation and hence the agent is assigned to a well-known location. In <ref> [57] </ref>, the architecture is designed to support signaling over wide-area networks and the use of fixed agents could lead to unacceptably large setup delays. Thus, the authors propose to keep the agents close to their mobile users by migrating these agents in the fixed network. <p> In [43], a prediction algorithm is incorporated to track the mobile users. Mobile floating agents are instantiated at locations "close" to the mobile users to ensure that users may access resources at their new locations. This differs from the proposal in <ref> [57] </ref> in that the user process is not simply instantiated at the new location but carries all its state information with it as it migrates between machines. <p> In our case, we are migrating a specific process, the user agent. We can thus assume that the executable code is present at the destination and accomplish the migration by transferring only a small amount of dynamic state information of the user agent. For example, in <ref> [57] </ref>, user agent migrations transfer only about 100 bytes of information and take only about 100 to 150 milliseconds of processing time. These two factors, the dependency of agent execution location on user mobility and the relatively low migration overhead introduce many new challenges in the design of migration. <p> In the presence of migration overheads, user agent migration results in increasing the load at the processor. A migration event with processing overhead due to migration is handled in the simulator in three phases to mimic as close as possible, the details of our user agent migration process implementation <ref> [57] </ref>. Consider a mobile user who moves from cell A to cell B. Also, assume that the migration policy accepts the migration of user agent UA from processor A to processor B. The simulation proceeds as follows: In the first phase, a job is queued in processor B. <p> is because, typically, most of the cost involved in migration depends on how much state information needs to be transferred (which will vary amongst different user agent implementations) while the the first phase is concerned mostly with the initialization of transfer (which tend to remain constant and small in general) <ref> [57] </ref>. the Count and Distance policies and different values of migration overhead, M O 126 (a) Count policy (b) Distance policy (with N = 20, net user flow rate of 0:1, and net load of 0:7).

Reference-contexts: While there exists some similarity between our problem of designing migration policies that "load balance" the execution of user agents and traditional distributed systems load balancing problems, there are two important differences. First, load balancing mechanisms in distributed systems <ref> [20, 21, 25, 67, 77] </ref> were designed so that 84 idle machines in a network of workstations could be profitably and transparently used. Thus, the choice of a processor on which to execute a process was primarily based on the load conditions in the processors.

Reference-contexts: If the mobile user is in an overlapping region between two or more cells, handoff calls may be delayed for a short duration before allocating a channel to the call.

In <ref> [68] </ref>, the authors propose using a measurement based queueing scheme where handoff calls are prioritized so that the call which is on the verge of being disconnected is given the highest priority.

Reference-contexts: SRS seems to provide the best performance, however, with additional hardware and software complexity.

Reference-contexts: We then look at a chaining policy (Policy 3), and finally a combination of chaining with the first two policies (Policies 4 and 5).

Connection rerouting procedures for ATM-based wireless networks have been studied extensively <ref> [1, 22, 24, 31, 45, 51, 71, 73] </ref>. However, there has been very little experimental evaluation of the various rerouting procedures. In [71], rerouting is implemented such that there is no loss and very little disruption of user traffic. <p> We address this issue in the context of a network architecture proposed in <ref> [73] </ref> for signaling in wireless ATM networks by exploiting one of its salient connection management features. We also show how our handoff flows can be mapped into this architecture, presenting a unified view of connection setup and rerouting. 70 hosts and several signaling servers. <p> We also show how our handoff flows can be mapped into this architecture, presenting a unified view of connection setup and rerouting. 70 hosts and several signaling servers. This approach is based on a distributed call processing architecture proposed for ATM networks and extended for wireless ATM networks <ref> [33, 73] </ref>. The Connection servers in Figure 3.13 are responsible for connection management. Their responsibilities include finding routes between communicating endpoints, computing end-to-end QoS measures, and modifying and releasing connections.

Reference-contexts: We note that a system will perform a variety of other functions during a handoff including call admission control [52], assigning frequency slots (in the case of a TDMA system [18]) or codes (in the case of a CDMA system <ref> [74] </ref>), power control, etc. These issues, however, are orthogonal to those considered here. Before describing various approaches towards handoff, let us first examine three important issues that must be 37 addressed by any handoff approach: wireless link management, handoff initiation and cross-over switch discovery.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION During the last few years there has been tremendous interest and progress in the field of multimedia wireless networks <ref> [2, 12, 17, 18, 19, 49, 62, 64, 65, 66, 75] </ref>. These wireless networks will provide users with the ability to communicate anytime, anywhere, and in any form [23]. This type of service can be provided, in theory, by the current cellular technology and infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: Given Lemma 2.1 for the finite horizon optimal cost function, under minor technical conditions, it can be shown that the optimal cost function for the infinite-horizon problem, V (i) = lim k!1 V k (i), is also non-decreasing and convex <ref> [76, Assumption 8.28] </ref>. Also, since the state space is finite and the Markov chain induced by the control policy is irreducible, V (i) V (0) is uniformly bounded [60]. We now return to consider the original average cost problem. <p> The basis step is again trivial since V Assume V k1 (i) is convex. We need to show that V k (i) is convex. The first and second terms in Equation (2.4) can be shown to be convex by induction [8.35 in <ref> [76] </ref>]. The arguments for the 3rd and 4th terms follow (we have again factored the common term ). Let V k1 (i) be convex for i = 1; :::; C 1. Let ffi (i) represent the 3rd and 4th terms of V k (i 1).

Reference-contexts: While there exists some similarity between our problem of designing migration policies that "load balance" the execution of user agents and traditional distributed systems load balancing problems, there are two important differences. First, load balancing mechanisms in distributed systems <ref> [20, 21, 25, 67, 77] </ref> were designed so that 84 idle machines in a network of workstations could be profitably and transparently used. Thus, the choice of a processor on which to execute a process was primarily based on the load conditions in the processors.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the agent serves the role of a Mobile Support Router of the Mobile IP scheme [28] which manages the routing for a specific mobile terminal. The framework developed in ParcTab is used in Wit <ref> [78] </ref>, where the network proxy process 83 provides connections, and acts as an application programmer interface. Applications always communicate with the mobile terminal through the proxy. A distinction can be made among the agents depending on whether they affect the control information or the data sent/received by the mobile user.

Reference-contexts: This set of assumptions has been found to be reasonable as long as the number of mobile users in a cell is much greater than the number of channels and have been used in the models in <ref> [52, 68, 79] </ref>. <p> The mobile user then moves to one of the neighboring cells with equal probability. These are fairly common assumptions for modeling user mobility in wide-area wireless environments and have been used in <ref> [38, 79] </ref>. Each user is represented by a network-based user agent as detailed in Section 4.3. We assume that the requests at the user agent arrive in a Poisson manner with rate c .

Reference-contexts: The analysis of other policies can be performed in a similar manner. While large portions of a wide-area wireless networks may be homogeneous, there will exist several smaller regions that display heterogeneous characteristics <ref> [80] </ref>. For example, isolated "hot spots" can occur in cities, stadiums etc. This heterogeneity can be captured only by modeling the cells in a heterogeneous region individually. Consider a heterogeneous network with C cells and U users. Let the cells be labeled 0; 1; ; C 1.
