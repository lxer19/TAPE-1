Abstract: The multi-parent scanning crossover, generalizing the traditional uniform crossover, and diagonal crossover, generalizing 1-point (n-point) crossovers, were introduced in [5]. In subsequent publications, see [6, 18, 19], several aspects of multi-parent recombination are discussed. Due to space limitations, however, a full overview of experimental results showing the performance of multi-parent GAs on numerical optimization problems has never been published. This technical report is meant to fill this gap and make results available.

Reference-contexts: Hordijk and Manderick [11] investigate the usefulness of recombination on (epistatic) NK landscapes. Evolutionary Programming uses unary operators only. Evolution Strategies are traditionally based on mutation as main search operator <ref> [2] </ref>, but use recombination too. Interestingly, the so-called global recombination in ES allows that a child receives its genes from more than two parents. However, for each bit in the child only two parents are considered, the increased parent number comes by randomly choosing two new parents for each bit. <p> However, for each bit in the child only two parents are considered, the increased parent number comes by randomly choosing two new parents for each bit. In the comparisons reported in <ref> [2] </ref> ES and EP exhibit better performance than GAs. One possible way to improve GA performance is to incorporate new features in the GA, i.e. features that do not belong to the traditional GAs paradigm. Some recent attempts that were successful use Lamarckian/Baldwinian effects, or a problem decomposition, [14, 20].

Reference-contexts: On the one hand more research is needed to understand this new phenomenon of multi-parent reproduction. Theoretical analysis of schema survival and schema combination rates, [16], can illuminate the success of using n &gt; 2 parents. Looking at positional and distributional bias, <ref> [7] </ref>, in diagonal, respectively scanning crossover can explain their differences and determine their right domain of application. Experiments on carefully designed test functions, such as Royal Road, deceptive functions, NK landscapes can help to determine 'multi-parent's niche', i.e. to identify those problems where multi-parent operators have advantage over classical ones.

Reference-contexts: Parallel to, and partly caused by, the increasing variety of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) the usefulness of sexual recombination in GAs has been questioned. For instance, 13 Eshelman and Schaffer <ref> [8] </ref> look for 'crossover's niche', i.e. problems where pair-wise mat-ing has competitive advantages.

Bit variance and co-variance [17], early commitment behaviour <ref> [8] </ref>, the right balance between exploration and exploitation are heavily influenced by these two issues. Multi-parent recombination allows for fine tuning the disruption rate.
