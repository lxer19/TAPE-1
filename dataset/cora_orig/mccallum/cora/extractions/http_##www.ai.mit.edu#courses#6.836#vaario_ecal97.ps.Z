Abstract: In this paper a new method for modeling the growth of neural structures is proposed. The motive of this research is to explore the possibilities for biologically plausible neural growth, and to study how neural based systems could be closely embodied into the environment where they exist. As a result of this research we have found a simple method based on diffusion field modeling to be able to control neural growth together with genetic factors. The simulation results show how neural structures are capable of creating a meaningful network to control the simple behaviors of an artificial creature in a simulated world. The environment control reduces the need for genetic control factors thereby providing faster evolution with a simple genetic coding.

Reference-contexts: According to the assumption, the environment (concentration field) will become a steady state, i.e., the left side of Eq.(2) is equal to zero. Thus, the distribution of the concentration is described by Eq.(3) , which is called the homogeneous Laplace equation <ref> [1] </ref>. dC = D 5 2 C (2) @ 2 C @ 2 C @ 2 C where D represents the diffusion coefficient, and C = C (t; x; y; z) represents the concentration value of a substance at the point (x; y; z) of the environment at time t.

Reference-contexts: Fitness for the creatures is evaluated by f = step (j V step j fi (1 q j v step j)) (13) where V is a measure of the average rotation speed of the two wheels, and v is the algebraic difference between the signed speed values of the wheels <ref> [4] </ref>. environments. 4 Results The simulations were done with an internal world set to consist of five initial neurons, five sensors (two for light and three for avoidance), and two motors. The size of the diffusion grid was 16 fi 26 fi 12.

Reference-contexts: The second possible sensor was for obstacles. This proximity sensor (a whisker) was calculated by exploring a set of 21 points placed in a triangle in front of it <ref> [5] </ref>. The Stimulus j value varies between 0 and 100 with 0 meaning no obstacles, and 100 meaning an obstacle occupying all 21 points. The Stimulus j value is used to generate the diffusion source inside the internal world (Eq. 11).

Reference-contexts: Also, the current neural growth is controlled solely by the diffusion fields so that the created structures are specialized for the particular environment in which they grow. A more general approach is to increase the genetic factors, as it has been discussed in <ref> [14] </ref>. 5 Conclusion Research has shown that diffusion field control is capable of directing the growth of neural networks. Simulation provides a real-time, three-dimensional visualization of the growth process. It would be relatively easy to include other controlling factors for this growth, such as mechanical space.
