Abstract: Studies on design research methodology are infrequent, although there is a consensus that more effort is needed for improving design research quality. Previous calls for exercising better research methodology have been unsuccessful. As numerous studies reveal, there is no single scientific methodology that is exercised in science or in any other research practice. Rather, research methodologies are socially constructed. Since some constructions are better than others for different purposes, it becomes valuable to study different methodologies and their influence on research practice and results. Proposals for such studies are offered.

Reference-contexts: This view does not advocate for nor lead to anarchy.

It only acknowledges that the assumptions underlying methodologies and their potential effectiveness and drawbacks for conducting certain types of research projects must be studied.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, if the study follows a different methodology such as participatory research (Reich et al, 1992; Whyte, 1991), the nature of the study would change significantly into long-term case studies where real design problems are addressed.

Third, practitioners are very reluctant to use optimization procedures (Adelman, 1992; Haftka and Sobieski, 1992).

Reference-contexts: First, independent of any discipline, optimization is a very restricted view of design (even with respect to Simon's (1981) restricted view). Second, results obtained on simple benchmark problems do not necessarily transfer to real design problems nor do they reflect performance on other benchmark problems <ref> (Haftka and Sobieski, 1992) </ref>; simple benchmark comparisons provide little understanding of the relative merit of different optimization procedures (Burns, 1989).

Reference-contexts: I have no intention to select between these two interpretations or to develop others but to explain how to improve research practice without assuming a fixed methodology. To start with, we must acknowledge that there are differing views about scientific methodology <ref> (Kourany, 1987) </ref>. In addition, we must acknowledge studies on science and technology demonstrating that scientific progress is influenced by social, cultural, and political factors.
