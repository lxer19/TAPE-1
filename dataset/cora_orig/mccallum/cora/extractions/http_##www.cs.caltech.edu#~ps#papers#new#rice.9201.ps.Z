Reference-contexts: Also for any v h in V h , we have v h = i=1 The V h -interpolant is defined by h v = i=1 for any v 2 C 0 ( ). There are estimates of the interpolation error in <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In order to get error estimates for ku u * h k H 1 (!) and ku u * h k L 2 (!) , we need to extend the solution u of problem (2.7) from H 2 (!) into V . In <ref> [4] </ref>, there is a basic extension result. We state it in the following Theorem 4.1 Let ! be a bounded domain in R d with a C k;1 boundary for some integer k 0 and ! where is an open set.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we are more concerned with checking the accuracy of these methods. In later papers we will go to methods which will dramatically speed up these calculations yielding the same accuracy (such as multigrid and parallel computation; see <ref> [6] </ref>, [11]). In the following tables, we present the relative errors E *;L ! with respect to different choices of * and the levels L = 0; 1, in H 1 and L 2 norm.

Reference-contexts: problem (2.1), (2.2) based on the so-called fictitious (or imbedding) domain concept; fictitious domain formulations (to be described in Section 3) heavily rely on the variational formulations for the Neumann problem (2.1), (2.2) to be discussed in the next section. 2.2 Variational Formulation of the Neumann Prob lem Following, e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>, we derive a variational formulation of problem (2.1) by multiplying both sides of equation (2.1) by v 2 H 1 (!), and then applying the divergence theorem. <p> The variational formulation of (2.1), (2.2) derived from (2.6) becomes ( Find u 2 H 1 (!) such that 8v 2 H 1 (!) we have R R ! fvdx + hg; vi: (2:7) It is shown in, e.g., <ref> [7] </ref> that problem (2.7) has (as a consequence of the Lax-Milgram lemma) a unique solution if (2.3)-(2.5) hold. Formulation (2.7) is at the basis of powerful Galerkin-type solution methods such as finite elements (see, e.g., [12,7,2,1]).

Reference-contexts: But the basis for wavelet method are genus 3 scaling functions and the finite diemnsional subspace for finite element method is the one defined in (5.2.2) which consists of piecewise continuous linear functions. The better behavior of the relative L 2 -error obtained by wavelet approximation is expected. In <ref> [9] </ref> it is pointed out that the approximation of the first order differential operator associated with the genus 3 Daubechies wavelet basis is the 9-point finite difference operator with trunction error of order 4. By Theorem 4.5, the finite element approxiamtion with piecewise continuous linear functions is of 2nd order.

Reference-contexts: Remark: (1) It is convenient to choose the expansion spaces for u * L and ! to be the same to calculate Z ! (rurv + uv)dx: (2) To calculate the boundary integral on the right hand side, we use the uniform geometric measure approach introduced in <ref> [13] </ref> to avoid numerical integration, since the latter required the knowledge of the parametrization of @!. Briefly speaking, one can write Z gds = R 2 where is a Radon measure supported on @!. <p> Therefore, if we sample g; ! ; F in V l as g l ; !;l ; F l , and approximate by l , 19 which is calculated accordingly by the formula (5.40), one can show Z g l d l ! @! as l ! +1, see <ref> [13] </ref> for the proof. Here we choose l &gt;> L for better accuracy.
