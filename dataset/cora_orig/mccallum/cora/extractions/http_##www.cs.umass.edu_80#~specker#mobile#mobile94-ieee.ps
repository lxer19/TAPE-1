Title: Anonymity in a Mobile Computing Environment

Abstract: In a mobile computing environment, it is desirable to protect information about the movements and activities of mobile entities from onlookers. Solutions to this problem of providing anonymity have to be developed with the constraints of mobile computing environments in mind. In this paper, it is argued that this issue merits investigation. A brief survey of the nature of anonymity provided in proposed or existing mobile computing environments is presented. It is argued further that achieving limited but practical anonymity using standard cryptographic techniques is feasible. Example solutions are presented.

Reference-contexts: K MH and K H ). It also needs to store K MR (or enough information to re-compute K MR ) for the duration of its stay in R. A correctness proof of this protocol using the BAN logic [3] appears in <ref> [1] </ref>. However, the proof only establishes that the authentication protocol is correct. In future work, I hope to investigate how the analy sis techniques can be used to draw formal conclusions about the preservation of anonymity. 3 Related Work A referee pointed me to the work done by David Chaum.

Reference-contexts: Even if this argument is valid for a specific environment, it is likely to be a temporary limitation. What is more relevant is the asymmetry in available resources between mobile entities and their stationary counterparts. Beller et. al. observe <ref> [2] </ref> that it is feasible to design practical authentication mechanisms using PKCSs keeping this asymmetry in mind. 2.3 A Hybrid Solution Complete anonymity may be hard to achieve. But it might also not be an absolute requirement.

Reference-contexts: The modalities of providing such anonymity depend on the underlying security infrastructure of the system. Typically, this infrastructure is built using a shared key cryptosys-tem (SKCS), a public key cryptosystem (PKCS) or a hybrid system. Anonymity has two aspects <ref> [4] </ref>. Anonymity of location deals with keeping an entity's movements and whereabouts confidential. Anonymity of data origin/destination deals with keeping an entity's activities confidential. The latter seeks to prevent an onlooker from associating the entity with messages sent to/from it or with the sessions in which it is a participant. <p> This way, a reduced level of anonymity can be provided by making a limited disclosure of information. Preserving anonymity of data origin is similar to preserving anonymity of location. Anonymity of data destination is somewhat different when the destination is a mobile entity. Carlsen's solution <ref> [4] </ref> suggests essentially (see below for a clarification) the following: a domain server D that wants to send a message to a mobile M currently present in its domain, will multi-cast a message fM; K s g K DM to all the mobile entities currently present in the domain. <p> However, when M wanders into a different domain R, it cannot be expected to know the public key, K R . It has to identify itself first so that R can determine how to mutually authenticate M . The decrypt-on-the-fly solution by Carlsen <ref> [4] </ref> to provide anonymity of data destina-tion (as described in the previous section) will be prohibitively expensive in the case of a PKCS. Some researchers [7][9] have discouraged the use of a PKCS to build authentication protocols for environments with mobile entities.

Reference-contexts: Unconditional anonymity also opens the possibility of "perfect crime" (See [13], page 123, for a reference). Chaum uses the phrase "limited anonymity" in <ref> [5] </ref> to denote the anonymity provided by a special set of protocols. These protocols, like the unconditional anonymity protocols, preserve the anonymity of participants from onlookers and from each other.

Reference-contexts: Chaum and others have done extensive work on unconditionally anonymous protocols to implement, among other things, the digital equivalent of cash. The basic theme of security (for providing and/or using services and products) without identification is expounded by Chaum in <ref> [6] </ref>. By requiring that the security of a transaction not be dependent on establishing the identities of participants to one another, it is possible to design protocols that achieve complete unconditional anonymity. Unconditional anonymity also opens the possibility of "perfect crime" (See [13], page 123, for a reference).

Reference-contexts: Further, an onlooker will be able to use a long lived alias M t to link the various activities of M for the period during which the alias remains in effect. An alternative is to use short-lived aliases <ref> [8] </ref>. Aliases are changed by mutual agreement between the mobile entity and its home domain server. This implies that the mobile and the home domain stay synchronized. If synchronization is lost, a sub-protocol is necessary for re-synchronization.

If synchronization is lost, a sub-protocol is necessary for re-synchronization. Achieving re-synchronization securely is a challenge. In [8] the mobile entity may be required to send its identity in the clear in order to achieve resynchronization. This, as observed in the same document, constitutes a "breach in the provision of the service." Loss of synchronization is likely to be rare.

Reference-contexts: By "limited anonymity" I mean that some information about the identity of a participant is leaked to an eavesdropping third party. The ideas presented here are intuitive. Similar ideas have been used in different contexts. In <ref> [10] </ref>, Maxem-chuk et. al. describe various protocols for providing anonymity using a building block called "Double Locked Box Protocol." Using this protocol, an entity A can send a message to another entity B via an intermediary I.

Reference-contexts: To do this, the client has to first announce its (claimed) identity in the clear. This makes it hard to provide anonymity of location. An intuitive solution is to use the notion of nicknames. Molva et. al. <ref> [11] </ref> suggest that a mobile entity could use a traveling alias when it travels in foreign domains. Only the mobile entity and its home domain will know the mapping between the traveling alias M t and the real identity M . <p> For example, in message M 5, R can allocate a temporary identifier to M as in <ref> [11] </ref> to be used in subsequent messages from and to M while it is in R. The same K MR is expected to be used for mutual authentication between M and R for subsequent connection attempts for the entire duration of M 's stay in R.

Reference-contexts: Anonymity is especially desirable when an entity travels outside of its `home domain.' 1 In spite of that, it has not been considered a basic requirement in designing protocols for mobile computing environments (e.g. the IETF mobile-IP effort <ref> [12] </ref> has not yet addressed this issue). Like every other aspect of security, provision of anonymity is tightly coupled with the architecture of the rest of the system.
