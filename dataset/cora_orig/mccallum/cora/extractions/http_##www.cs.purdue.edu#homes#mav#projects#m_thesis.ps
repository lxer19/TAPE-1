The iterative schemes that we have formed in the previous section can be described by the following procedure M u (i+1) = N u (i) + b.

Reference-contexts: For convergence results at the PDE level see e.g., [11]. On the other hand, very few research works at the linear algebra level can be found in the literature (see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>, [8], [15], [16], etc.). This is because of the inherent difficulties the solution to the corresponding linear problem presents.

Reference-contexts: For reasons related either to the characteristics of this problem or to the computing resources available one would like to replace (1) with a system of similar problems defined on the subdomains i . There are many ways to realize the coupling of the problems in this system (see <ref> [11] </ref>). From them we select one, consider two different approaches and subsequently we present the corresponding iterative schemes. They both use Dirichlet boundary conditions on the interfaces. <p> Then, they discretize the (continuous) PDE problem (s) and the linear system (s) produced is (are) solved by using as values for the parameters a; b the ones determined from the continuous problem (s). For convergence results at the PDE level see e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>. On the other hand, very few research works at the linear algebra level can be found in the literature (see e.g. [7], [8], [15], [16], etc.).

In this case, first the entire domain is discretized, next the subdo-mains are defined and then finite difference, finite element or even collocation methods are used to approximate the PDE problem and subproblems.
