Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of two resource reservation protocols, ST-II [6] and RSVP [7], in support of an Integrated Services Packet Network (ISPN). We use simulations to examine the network-wide resource requirements for each protocol to support a number of application communication styles, across a range of group sizes and membership distributions. We also present a comparison of the protocol features to accommodate network and group membership dynamics.

Reference-contexts: As we shall see the simplistic point-to-point reservation mechanism is very inefficient in terms of network resource allocation required to support mul-tipoint communications. An enabling technology for supporting multipoint communication incorporated into both ST-II and RSVP is multicast routing. Deering <ref> [2] </ref> describes how multicast distribution can be incorporated into a data-gram network to improve network resource utilization; however, ST-II and RSVP make different assumptions about the level of multicast support provided by the network. <p> RSVP models a reservation as two distinct components, a resource allocation and a packet filter.

Reference-contexts: The dynamic response of the reservation protocol can be characterized by the support for dynamic group memberships and the response to link and router failures. Initial work in supporting multicast end-to-end guaranteed service within the Internet protocol suite resulted in the development of the ST stream proto col <ref> [3] </ref>, and the later development of a second ver-sion of the protocol, ST-II [6], which was specified as an experimental protocol within the Internet community. A more recent proposal targeted at supporting the resource reservation requirements of an ISPN is the RSVP protocol [8].

Reference-contexts: ST-II incorporates a failure detection mechanism using Hello, Status, and Notify messages, and these add considerable complexity to the protocol. 10 In contrast, RSVP relies on the soft state refreshes to automatically adapt without additional protocol complexity. RSVP could 10 Partridge and Pink <ref> [5] </ref> note that much of the functionality is overlapping. be modified to incorporate a failure detection mechanism to trigger refreshes as an optimization; however, there are more fundamental differences that distinguish the protocols. The key difference between the two protocols is in where recovery takes place.

Stream setup is initiated when a source ST agent generates a Connect message listing the flow specification and initial set of participants.

Reference-contexts: However, the group mechanism is an experimental feature and no stream relations have been defined at this time. We do not consider the group mechanism in any of our analysis. 2.2 RSVP protocol RSVP <ref> [7] </ref> is similar to ST-II in that a data stream is modeled as a simplex distribution tree rooted at the source and extending to all receivers. However, the mechanisms for group sources and receivers to establish resource reservations and the reservation styles supported differ substantially from the ST-II model.

Reference-contexts: A more recent proposal targeted at supporting the resource reservation requirements of an ISPN is the RSVP protocol <ref> [8] </ref>. The RSVP protocol is currently in the design phase, an IETF working group has been formed to evolve the protocol along the standard track. In this paper we compare the operation of the ST-II and RSVP protocols in support of applications typical of an ISPN.
