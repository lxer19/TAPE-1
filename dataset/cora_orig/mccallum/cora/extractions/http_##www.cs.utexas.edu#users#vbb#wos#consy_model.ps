Title: Data Validity Models for Distributed Information Systems  
Author: V. B. Balayoghan 
Date: December 9, 1996  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling correctness, currency and consistency in distributed information systems (DISs) such as the World-Wide Web. The goal of the proposed framework is to model what it means for data to be valid in an environment of autonomous information servers. The nature of data validity is explored as concerns of correctness, currency, and consistency. First, we propose a model of correctness that explicitly captures the the existence of multiple degrees of correctness in a DIS. An abstraction of correctness is then used to form concepts of currency and consistency, with currency being constituted as a measure of recency of correctness, and consistency as a measure of duration of simultaneous correctness. An implementation of the model using timestamps is also explored.

Reference-contexts: approach is used: * the users write data operations in units of transactions that, when run alone, will preserve all integrity constraints; and, * the system ensures that the interleaving of transactions is done in such a manner as to have the same effect as some sequential ordering of transactions <ref> [4] </ref>. The centrally controlled transaction approach is not well-suited to the DIS environment due to the concerns of autonomy and scalability. 1.2 Shared memory systems Shared memory systems deal with consistency at a much finer time and data granularity.

The cache coherency approach does not model the inter-relationships between objects nor the complex semantics of what it means for an object to be correct. <p> Intuitively, t-vintage currency asserts that the object was correct at a precise past time instant, while t-bound currency makes a weaker assertion that the object was correct at time t or at a more recent time. The names vintage and bound are carried over from <ref> [5] </ref> where they are used in the context of read-only transactions in database. 3.3 Consistency Consistency applies to a collection of objects. An essential feature of our model is to view the consistency of a collection of objects as the duration of their simultaneous correctness.

Reference-contexts: An extensive array of consistency models including atomic consistency, sequential consistency, causal consistency, pipelined RAM, cache consistency, processor consistency, slow memory, weak consistency, release consistency and entry consistency have been proposed and analyzed for this domain <ref> [10] </ref>. A model is considered stronger if it is more restrictive in the sets of execution sequences it permits. In general, the stronger a model, the easier it is to program with, but the harder it is to implement it in hardware.
