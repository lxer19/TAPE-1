Abstract: This paper 1 presents a precise market model for a well-defined class of dis tributed configuration design problems. Given a design problem, the model defines a computational economy to allocate basic re sources to agents participating in the design. The result of running these design economies constitutes the market solution to the original problem. After defining the configuration design framework, I describe the mapping to computational economies and our results to date. For some simple examples, the system can produce good designs relatively quickly. However, analysis shows that the design economies are not guaranteed to find optimal designs, and we identify and discuss some of the major pitfalls. Despite known shortcomings and limited explorations thus far, the market model offers a useful conceptual viewpoint for analyzing distributed design problems.

Reference-contexts: Distributed Configuration Design We adopt a standard framework for configuration design (Mittal and Frayman 1989) . Our specific formulation follows (Darr and Birmingham 1994), and covers many representative systems <ref> (Balkany et al. 1993) </ref> . Design in this framework corresponds to selection of parts to perform functions . More precisely, a design problem consists of: A set of attributes, A 1 ,, A n , and their associated domains, X 1 ,, X n .

Reference-contexts: Finally, there is a large literature on decomposition methods for mathematical programming problems, which could perhaps be applied to distributed design. Many of these and other distributed optimization techniques <ref> (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis 1989) </ref> can themselves be interpreted in economic terms, using the close relationship between prices and Lagrange multipliers. The main distinction of the approach advocated here is conceptual.

Reference-contexts: Distributed Configuration Design We adopt a standard framework for configuration design (Mittal and Frayman 1989) . Our specific formulation follows <ref> (Darr and Birmingham 1994) </ref>, and covers many representative systems (Balkany et al. 1993) . Design in this framework corresponds to selection of parts to perform functions . <p> As mentioned above, it is typical in mul - tiagent design to allocate individual agents responsibility for distinct components or functions. Within our distributed design scheme, these agents correspond to catalogs. In a distributed constraintsatisfaction formulation of the problem <ref> (Darr and Birmingham 1994) </ref>, catalog agents select a part to contribute to the overall design. The chosen part entails a particular pattern of resource usage and performance, as specified in its associated attribute vector. <p> There may be some encoding tricks to get around this restriction in some cases, but the basic design economy assumes this property. An Example To illustrate the mapping from configuration design problems to design economies, we carry out the exercise for an example presented by <ref> (Darr and Birmingham 1994) </ref>. The problem is a very simplified computer configuration design. In the example, we have two functions to satisfy: processing, and serial port.

Reference-contexts: This is also the concern of Distributed AI as a computational science. Related Work In addition to my own prior work in market-oriented programming (Wellman 1993) , there have been several other efforts to exploit markets for distributed computation. Most famous in AI is the contract net <ref> (Davis and Smith 1983) </ref>, but it is only recently that true economic mechanisms have been incorporated in that framework (Sandholm 1993).

Reference-contexts: This approach also shares some conceptual features with Shohams approach to agent-oriented programming (Shoham 1993) . Where Shoham defines a set of interac - tions based on speech acts, we focus exclusively on the economic actions such as exchange and production. In both approaches (as well as some others <ref> (Huberman 1988) </ref> ), the underlying idea is to get an improved understanding of a complex computational system via social constructs. Finally, there is a large literature on decomposition methods for mathematical programming problems, which could perhaps be applied to distributed design.

Reference-contexts: Because prices are a very compact way to convey this incentive information to each agent, we can argue that price systems also satisfy C <ref> (Koopmans 1970) </ref> . For these reasons, some have found the market economy an inspiring social metaphor for approaches to coordinating distributed computational agents. Thus, we sometimes see mechanisms and protocols appealing to notions of negotiation, bidding, or other economic behavior.

Reference-contexts: We argue that most of these problems are inherent in decentralization generally, not in the design economy per se, and moreover that the market model offers useful concepts for engineering the configuration of a variety of multiagent tasks.

Reference-contexts: This approach is highly congruent with much work in Artificial Intelligence, where we attempt to characterize an agents behavior in terms of its knowledge and goals (or more generally, beliefs, desires, and intentions). Indeed, this knowledge level analysis requires some kind of rationality abstraction <ref> (Newell 1982) </ref>, and is perhaps even implicit in our usage of the term agent. Decentralization. The central concern of economics is to relate decentralized, individual decisions to aggregate behavior of the overall society. This is also the concern of Distributed AI as a computational science.

Reference-contexts: Given certain technical restrictions on the producer technologies and consumer preferences, equilibrium is guaranteed to exist and the system converges to it. Specifically, if technologies and preferences are smooth and strictly convex, then a unique equilibrium exists (see <ref> (Varian 1984) </ref> for formal treatment). If in addition, the derived demands are such that increasing the price for one good does not decrease the demand for others, then the iterative bidding process is guaranteed to converge to this equilibrium (Arrow and Hurwicz 1977; Milgrom and Roberts 1991). <p> The consumers problem is to set demands maximizing utility, subject to the budget constraint. This defines a constrained optimization problem, parametrized by current going prices. In our example, we adopt a standard special functional form for utility, one exhibiting constant elasticity of sub - stitution (CES) <ref> (Varian 1984) </ref>. The CES utility function is u x 1 ,, x n ( ) = a i x i i=1 , where the a i are good coefficients and r is a generic substitution parameter.

Reference-contexts: Given a design problem, our model defines a compu - tational economy to solve the design problem, expressed in terms of concepts from microeconomic theory. We can then implement these economies in our WALRAS system for market-oriented programming <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref> , thus producing a runnable design economy. The following sections describe the configuration design framework, the mapping to computational economies, and preliminary results. For some simple examples, the system can produce good designs relatively quickly. <p> Since the markets for the goods are interconnected (due to interactions in both production and consumption), the price for one good will generally affect the demand and supply for others. WALRAS adjusts the prices via an iterative bidding protocol, until the system reaches a competitive equilibrium (see <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref> for details), i.e., an allocation and set of prices such that (1) consumers bid so to maximize utility, subject to their budget constraints, (2)producers bid so to maximize profits, subject to their technological possibilities, and (3)net demand is zero for all goods. <p> Decentralization. The central concern of economics is to relate decentralized, individual decisions to aggregate behavior of the overall society. This is also the concern of Distributed AI as a computational science. Related Work In addition to my own prior work in market-oriented programming <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref> , there have been several other efforts to exploit markets for distributed computation. Most famous in AI is the contract net (Davis and Smith 1983), but it is only recently that true economic mechanisms have been incorporated in that framework (Sandholm 1993).
