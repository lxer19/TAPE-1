Reference-contexts: This is what we do below with the example of In Figure 1, we have augmented the edges of N (P ) with flows. This does not correspond to a minimum flow. The embedding corresponding to a flow can be determined as follows (see <ref> [2] </ref> for details on how to determine the grid coordinates of the vertices and bends). * The total flow along a face-to-face edge in N (P ) represents the total number of bends in that edge of G which it crosses. 2 * The flow along a vertex-to-face edge in N <p> The orthogonal embedding corresponding to the flow in Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2. It is obvious that this is not the embedding with the minimum number of bends. This fact can be formally determined using the following property proved in <ref> [2] </ref>.
