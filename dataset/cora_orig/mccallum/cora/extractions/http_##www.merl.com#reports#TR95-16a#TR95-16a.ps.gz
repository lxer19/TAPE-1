Abstract: There is a natural desire to make multi-user virtual environments large in spatial extent, in numbers of objects, and in numbers of users interacting with the environment. However, doing this brings up several problems: efficiently managing the flow of large amounts of data between large numbers of users, representing precise position and velocity information about objects that are arrayed across a large volume of space, and allowing designers to create parts of a virtual environment separately and combine them together later. Locales are an efficient method for solving these problems by breaking up a virtual world into chunks that can be described and communicated independently. While having many benefits, locales introduce a problem: finding something when you do not know what locale it is in. This is solved by the companion concept of beacons, which makes it possible to find something no matter where it is.

Reference-contexts: The structure of a Spline process is shown in Figure 1. The inter-process communication module sends out multicast messages describing objects in the world model and receives messages from other Spline processes about changes made remotely. As in SIMNET <ref> [1] </ref>, each message describes the current state of a world model object and is used by the processes that receive it to update their world model copies. <p> A user can ignore all this extraneous information and maintain a picture of only the small part of the virtual world that is near. For example, in SIMNET <ref> [1] </ref> and in systems based on the IEEE Distributed Interactive Simulation standard (DIS) that grew out of SIMNET, `filtering' is used to discard information about parts of the virtual world that need not concern a given user.

Reference-contexts: Neighbors List of structures describing for each neighbor N : Neighbor name Network-wide unique ID of N . Import transform Transformation matrix relating N to L. Export transform Transformation matrix relating L to N . this could be represented, such as BSP trees. Spline uses a specialized representation <ref> [2] </ref> that is optimized for the very rapid determination of which parts of the boundary are immediately above and below a given reference point.

Reference-contexts: The locale for room R needs to have as neighbors the locales for room R 0 , hall H, and the outdoors O. Typically, which pairs of locales need to be made neighbors can be determined by statically computing visibility using methods like those of Teller <ref> [3] </ref>. A locale object L specifies which other locales are its neighbors and the exact geometric relationship between L and each neighbor N . <p> For instance, locales can be used to omit the rendering of the interiors of buildings when they are not visible from the outside. This use of locales follows along the path pioneered by work on the static determination of visibility regions <ref> [3, 7] </ref>. However, it is important to note that locales go beyond this work by supporting a number of additional features. 6 Precise Positions and Velocities A second problem faced by the builders of large virtual environments is how to maintain precision over long distances. <p> Another important direction of research is the creation of tools to support the design of locales. In some situations, e.g., breaking the model for a building with many rooms into locales, it should be possible to design locales completely automatically, using visibility analysis <ref> [3] </ref>. In other situations, it is appropriate for a designer to take more direct control. However, even then, semi-automated tools for visualizing and modifying locales are essential.

Reference-contexts: This means that a multi-user virtual environment can become extremely large as long as the users are sufficiently spread out. A similar result is obtained by systems like WAVES <ref> [6] </ref> and RING [7] through the mediation of intermediate server processes rather than multicast messaging. This approach achieves increased flexibility at the cost of increased latency. For example, the intermediate servers can dynamically determine which user is near which other user and dynamically route messages accordingly.

Reference-contexts: This is done by using a tag corresponding to the Internet address of the machine where the visual renderer is running. By looking at beacon tags, a given visual renderer can link up with the appropriate user process. 10 Diamond Park Diamond Park <ref> [8] </ref> is the first large-scale virtual world built using Spline. The park consists of a square mile of virtual landscape with about a dozen buildings, two lakes, and two ornamental pools scattered around a central valley surrounded by hills (see Figure 7).
