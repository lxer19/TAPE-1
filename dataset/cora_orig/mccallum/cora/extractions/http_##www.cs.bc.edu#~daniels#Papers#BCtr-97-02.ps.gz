Reference-contexts: To that end, a Lagrangian relaxation approach is used. The subproblems resulting from the relaxation have the integrality property, so the Lagrangian relaxation does not give an upper bound tighter than the LP relaxation <ref> (Beasley 1993) </ref>. Thus, the method here is more correctly termed a Lagrangian heuristic. Each iteration of the subgradient optimization search procedure easily yields a feasible solution to the problem. <p> A subgradient algorithm can be used to minimize the upper bound. Ideally, one should also try to improve the lower bound at each iteration by finding a feasible solution to the primal. In this research, the Lagrangian relaxation approach is properly called a "Lagrangian heuristic" (LH) <ref> (Beasley 1993) </ref>, since the relaxation is such that the optimal value of Z D is no better (i.e., no lower) than the value of the linear program relaxation of Z P (this is because both of the subproblems have the integrality property: there exist optimal solutions to their linear program relaxations

Reference-contexts: The problem studied was to arrange (without overlaps) a set of irregularly-shaped pieces on a fixed-width, infinite-length resource. An heuristic state space search method for this problem was developed by Albano & Sapuppo (1980). Simulated annealing and tabu search have also been applied <ref> (Oliveira & Page 3 Ferreira 1993, Blazewicz et al. 1993, respectively) </ref>. Chung (1990) uses an artificial intelligence approach for the case where the resource material itself is irregular (e.g., leather products).

Reference-contexts: This restriction cannot be made in the general case where some pieces are identical. Therefore, in the distinct piece case, K additional constraints can be written as follows: where 4.5 Comparison With Other Covering Models The structure of this problem is similar to the MCLP <ref> (Church & ReVelle 1974) </ref>. The goal in the MCLP is to locate J facilities so as to maximize the population "covered" by at least one facility.

Reference-contexts: One must decide which pieces are to be cut from each sheet, and arrange the pieces on each sheet. Another important situation involving multiple container packing occurs in the apparel industry, where problems with a large/small piece dichotomy are common <ref> (Daniels 1995) </ref>. A two-phase layout strategy is typically used by humans in which large pieces are placed in the first phase and small pieces in the second phase. After the first phase, the containers are the unused portions of material. <p> One can consider one container at a time, several containers simultaneously, or all containers simultaneously. The authors believe simultaneous consideration is a promising approach and this forms the basis for the current work. The related work section describes previous work of Daniels in this area <ref> (Daniels 1995) </ref>. Related work is discussed in the next section. Section 3 summarizes the contributions and establishes the focus of the current work. Sections 4-6 present, respectively, the Integer Programming formulation, a Lagrangian relaxation which allows decomposition into two sub-problems, and an improvement heuristic. <p> If the number of pieces is very small (e.g., &lt;10) and arbitrary rotation is not allowed, then a translational containment algorithm <ref> (e.g., Daniels 1995) </ref> can be used to decide if all the pieces can be placed. A containment algorithm takes, as input, a collection of pieces and a container and decides whether or not the pieces can be placed into the container without overlap.

Reference-contexts: With rectangular pieces, this problem (and its many variations) is often referred to as the cutting stock problem and is well-known to be NP-complete <ref> (Garey & Johnson 1979) </ref>. Situations also exist when the pieces to be cut are non-rectangular (i.e., have "irregular" shapes). One such problem is that faced by an apparel manufacturer when individual pieces must be laid out on a fixed-width bolt of cloth.
