Title: Hamiltonian paths and cycles in hypertournaments

Abstract: Given two integers n and k, n k &gt; 1, a k-hypertournament T on n vertices is a pair (V; A), where V is a set of vertices, jV j = n and A is a set of k-tuples of vertices, called arcs, so that for any k-subset S of V , A contains exactly one of the k! k-tuples whose entries belong to S. A 2-hypertournament is merely an (ordinary) tournament. A path is a sequence v 1 a 1 v 2 a 2 v 3 :::v t1 a t1 v t of distinct vertices v 1 ; v 2 ; :::; v t and distinct arcs a 1 ; :::; a t1 such that v i precedes v i+1 in a i , 1 i t 1. A cycle can be defined analogously. A path or cycle containing all vertices of T (as v i 's) is Hamilto-nian. T is strong if T has a path from x to y for every choice of distinct x; y 2 V . We prove that every k-hypertournament on n (&gt; k) vertices has a Hamiltonian path (an extension of Redei's theorem on tournaments) and every strong k-hypertournament with n (&gt; k + 1) vertices has a Hamiltonian cycle (an extension of Camion's theorem on tournaments). Despite the last result, it is shown that the Hamiltonian cycle problem remains polynomial time solvable only for k 3 and becomes NP-complete for every fixed integer k 4.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, jA H (x 1 ; x 6 )j = 2. Therefore, by Lemma 3.5, H is Hamiltonian, a contradiction. 4 Complexity of the Hamiltonian cycle problem for k-hypertournaments It is well known (see <ref> [8] </ref> for an efficient algorithm) that the Hamiltonian cycle problem for 2-hypertournaments, i.e. (ordinary) tournaments is polynomial time solvable. The aim of this section is to show that the problem remains polynomial time solvable for k = 3, but becomes NP-complete for every fixed k 4.

We prove that every k-hypertournament on n (&gt; k) vertices has a Hamiltonian path and every strong k-hypertournament on n k + 2 5 vertices contains a Hamiltonian cycle. We also describe an infinite family of strong k-hypertournaments on k + 1 4 vertices which have no Hamiltonian cycles. <p> Note that a non-difficult modification of the construction in the proof of Theorem 4.2 shows that the Hamiltonian cycle problem for n 1-hypertournaments with n vertices is NP-complete. It would also be interesting to characterize pancyclic and vertex pancyclic hypertour-naments (extensions of well-known theorems by Moser and Moon, respectively, <ref> [11] </ref>).
