Abstract: In this paper we study the parallel complexity of Positive Linear Programming (PLP), i.e. the special case of Linear Programming in packing/covering form where the input constraint matrix and constraint vector consist entirely of positive entries. We show that the problem of exactly solving PLP is P-complete.

Reference-contexts: An algorithm with such a trade-off between approximation guarantee and efficiency is usually called an NCAS (NC Approximation Scheme) (see, e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>). PLP is of a particular interest since many important combinatorial problems can be casted by positive linear programs and therefore Luby and Nisan algorithm can be used to approximate them in NC.

Reference-contexts: We show that the problem of exactly solving PLP is P-complete. Our result is based on the observation that the Circuit Value Problem (CVP), which is P-complete [9], can be logspace reduced to PLP.

It is easy to prove by induction on the depth of the circuit that such linear program has only one feasible solution, 2 This version of CVP has also been shown to be P-complete. 2 namely the solution that corresponds to the correct settings of the gates.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the algorithm for PLP approximates the optimum size of the set cover within a factor of (1 + ") ln . The use of PLP in the design of parallel approximation algorithms has been further explored in <ref> [14] </ref>. Among other results, a PLP relaxation of Maximum Satisfiability (Max SAT) is presented whose optimum is at most 4/3 times the optimum of the Max SAT problem. In combination with Luby and Nisan's algorithm and a proper rounding scheme, this gives an NC (3=4 ")-approximate algorithm for Max SAT.
