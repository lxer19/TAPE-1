Abstract: This report presents a new approach to off-line handwritten numeral recognition. From the concept of perturbation due to writing habits and instruments, we propose a recognition method which is able to account for a variety of distortions due to eccentric handwriting. The new approach constitutes a shift from the usual pattern recognition paradigm where normalisation is the first step prior to feature extraction and classification. Normalisation is replaced by a set of perturbation processes modelling writing habits and instruments. As a result, the subsequent operations feature extraction and classification are independently applied for each perturbation type yielding a set of results that are eventually combined. We tested our method on two worldwide standard databases of isolated numerals, namely, CEDAR and NIST, and obtained 99:09% and 99:54% correct recognition rates at no-rejection level, respectively. The latter result was obtained by testing on more than 170000 numerals.

Reference-contexts: However, it suffers from two shortcomings, namely, that prototypes have to be hand-crafted and that the definition of cost functions is not obvious [17, 25]. The recognition of strongly distorted data has also been tackled by training the recogniser on additional artificially generated data <ref> [1, 4, 11, 28] </ref>. Further discussions on these different approaches will be presented in Section 6. In our approach, the reversing process is model-based. <p> This means that we do not attempt to detect the true perturbation parameters but simply make the input image closer to one of its standard forms, instead. This is the reason why we termed our method perturbation. The penalisation factor for each perturbation type t is w t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and is to be determined experimentally together with t in a validation phase (see Section 5.2). <p> Another family of methods that shares some similarities with ours consists in generating additional artificial data for training by using distortion models <ref> [1, 4, 11, 28] </ref>. In these methods, the distortions parameters must be chosen very carefully so as to not include 'strange' patterns into the training set. 15 7 Conclusions We have presented a new approach to handwriting recognition.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, the perturbation method is used in the second stage. This rule is optimal in the sense that for a given error rate of the first stage, it minimises the rejection rate, i.e., the average number of patterns submitted to the second stage <ref> [2] </ref>. 5.1 Pilot Study We first performed a pilot study on isolated handwritten numerals from the CEDAR database consisting of 18468 training patterns (br directories) and 2213 testing patterns (goodbs directories) [9]. These data were collected from live mail in the U.S. and were thus totally unconstrained.

Reference-contexts: Both C1 and C2 use the distance-weighted k-Nearest Neighbor rule as classifier. We also implemented a third "classical" recog-niser called C3 in the following by combining C1 and C2 <ref> [21, 3] </ref>. The combination is based on score summation, i.e., the combiner adds up the scores of each class from both systems. The recognition rates of these three systems at zero rejection level (forced choice) are presented in Table 1.

Reference-contexts: Each classical recogniser consists of two parts, namely, feature extraction and classification. We use two feature extraction methods, which are based on projection and contour histogramming, respectively (see Appendix B). In the pilot study, the distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor rule acts as classifier for both feature extraction methods <ref> [5] </ref>. In the large scale experiments, neural networks are used as classifiers for both feature types [13]. To reduce the computation time, a two-stage scheme is used in all experiments involving the perturbation method. That is, a system without perturbation is first applied.

Reference-contexts: Only those systems that were trained on the same database (SD3) are included in this list. All systems were tested on SD7 (our Test2).

However, it is important to stress that our goal is not to compete with the participants of the conference, but to see whether the perturbation method can improve the recognition <p> For instance, it has been found that the error rate is cut by more than half for every tenfold increase in the size of the training set from 10 to 100000 samples <ref> [20] </ref>. 12 Table 2: Partition of NIST-SD3 and NIST-SD7 databases.

Reference-contexts: This approach is known as 'normalisation by exhaustive trial' <ref> [23] </ref>. However, it is very time consuming, since for each additional absolute value of k, we have to consider three values for each perturbation type fk ; 0; k g and therefore 3 T 1 channels have to be added to the system. <p> In the field of OCR, the earliest (to our knowledge) work that bears many resemblances to our method was described in a textbook in 1973 <ref> [23] </ref>, where the author mentioned a commercial system that successively tried different binarisation thresholding until the output confidence becomes higher than a given confidence level. Such a technique is conceptually equivalent to searching for an optimum confidence in the space of threshold parameters.

Twenty-nine groups from Europe and North America participated to compare the performance of their OCR systems. In total, 47 systems, both commercial and research, were presented. The databases contain isolated numerals (digits) as well as upper- and lower-case letters. <p> The relatively low recognition rate of all listed systems (less than 97%) was due to the fact that the training data (SD3) and the testing data (SD7) were collected from two different populations of writers, resulting in different statistical distributions <ref> [26] </ref>. Our experiments also confirm this difference: the recognition rate of the perturbation system PS on Test1 (part of SD3) is much better than on Test2 (SD7), even though the latter is better (more than 97%) than all listed systems in Table 4.
