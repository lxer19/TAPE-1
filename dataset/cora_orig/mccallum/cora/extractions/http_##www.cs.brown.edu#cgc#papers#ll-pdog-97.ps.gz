Abstract: A proximity drawing of a graph is one in which pairs of adjacent vertices are drawn relatively close together according to some proximity measure while pairs of non-adjacent vertices are drawn relatively far apart. The fundamental question concerning proximity drawability is: Given a graph G and a definition of proximity, is it possible to construct a proximity drawing of G? We consider this question for outerplanar graphs with respect to an infinite family of proximity drawings called fi-drawings. These drawings include as special cases the well-known Gabriel drawings (when fi = 1), and relative neighborhood drawings (when fi = 2). We first show that all biconnected outerplanar graphs are fi-drawable for all values of fi such that 1 fi 2. As a side effect, this result settles in the affirmative a conjecture by Lubiw and Sleumer [20, 22], that any biconnected outerplanar graph admits a Gabriel drawing. We then show that there exist biconnected outerplanar graphs that do not admit any convex fi-drawing for 1 fi 2. We also provide upper bounds on the maximum number of biconnected components sharing the same cut-vertex in a fi-drawable connected outerplanar graph. This last result is generalized to arbitrary connected planar graphs and is the first non-trivial characterization of connected fi-drawable graphs. Finally, a weaker definition of proximity drawings is applied and we show that all connected outerplanar graphs are drawable under this definition.

Reference-contexts: Application areas such as VLSI routing and circuit layout have stimulated considerable research on both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visibility drawings in which vertices are segments or simple non overlapping polygons and the directions of visibility are parallel to the axes. (see, e.g., <ref> [1, 13, 23, 27] </ref>). A different type of proximity is based upon the concept of a region of influence (also referred to as a proximity region). <p> A general theorem is given that provides an upper bound on the number of biconnected components sharing a cut-vertex in a fi-drawable graph, for fi 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. This is of particular interest since it is the first non-trivial result on the connectivity of fi-drawable graphs. <p> class of graphs such that the number of biconnected components sharing a cut-vertex is at most k; T k is the class of trees whose vertex degree is at most k; T is the class of forbidden trees described in [3]. fi Trees Connected Biconnected Maximal fi = 1 T <ref> [1] </ref> = T 4 T [3] G 2 6 G CO [1] G 4 G BO [1] = fBOg G MO [1] = fMOg [20, 22] 1 &lt; fi &lt; 1 5 ) T (fi) = T 4 [2] G CO (fi) G 4 G BO (fi) = fBOg G MO <p> a cut-vertex is at most k; T k is the class of trees whose vertex degree is at most k; T is the class of forbidden trees described in [3]. fi Trees Connected Biconnected Maximal fi = 1 T <ref> [1] </ref> = T 4 T [3] G 2 6 G CO [1] G 4 G BO [1] = fBOg G MO [1] = fMOg [20, 22] 1 &lt; fi &lt; 1 5 ) T (fi) = T 4 [2] G CO (fi) G 4 G BO (fi) = fBOg G MO (fi) = fMOg T [fi] = T 4 [2] G CO <p> k; T k is the class of trees whose vertex degree is at most k; T is the class of forbidden trees described in [3]. fi Trees Connected Biconnected Maximal fi = 1 T <ref> [1] </ref> = T 4 T [3] G 2 6 G CO [1] G 4 G BO [1] = fBOg G MO [1] = fMOg [20, 22] 1 &lt; fi &lt; 1 5 ) T (fi) = T 4 [2] G CO (fi) G 4 G BO (fi) = fBOg G MO (fi) = fMOg T [fi] = T 4 [2] G CO [fi] G 4 G BO <p> class of trees whose vertex degree is at most k; T is the class of forbidden trees described in [3]. fi Trees Connected Biconnected Maximal fi = 1 T <ref> [1] </ref> = T 4 T [3] G 2 6 G CO [1] G 4 G BO [1] = fBOg G MO [1] = fMOg [20, 22] 1 &lt; fi &lt; 1 5 ) T (fi) = T 4 [2] G CO (fi) G 4 G BO (fi) = fBOg G MO (fi) = fMOg T [fi] = T 4 [2] G CO [fi] G 4 G BO [fi] = fBOg G MO <p> R [x; y; fi] is the intersection of the two corresponding closed disks. 3 3.

Theorem 3.1 G BO <ref> [1] </ref> = fBOg, and G BO (fi) = G BO [fi] = fBOg for all values of fi such that 1 &lt; fi &lt; 2. <p> Thus a 4-cycle is a face in any fi-drawing with 1 &lt; fi 2. 7 2. For every face (v; w; u) of such that v and u are corner and w is side, we have that 6 vwu &lt; 2 , otherwise w 2 R <ref> [v; u; 1] </ref> (and hence w 2 R [v; u; fi] for larger values of fi), contradicting the fact that v and w are adjacent. <p> 4 Proximity Drawings of Connected Outerplanar Graphs We first state a general result on the maximum number of biconnected components that can be shared by a cut vertex in any fi-drawable graph and then apply the result to outerplanar fi-drawable graphs. 4.1 Connectivity of fi-drawable Graphs Theorem 4.1 Given fiin <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, let (k) be the maximum vertex degree in the block-cut-vertex tree of a (fi)-drawable graph. Similarly, let [k] be the maximum vertex degree in the block-cut-vertex tree of a [fi]-drawable graph. <p> Thus, the maximum number of edges incident on v cannot be greater than b 2 fl (fi) c. 2 Corollary 4.1 The following inclusion relations for G CO (fi) and G CO [fi] are true. 1.

Suppose G admitted a fi-drawing for some fi 2 <ref> [1; 2] </ref>. With the same reasoning as in the proof of the previous lemma, we have that there exist two consecutive exterior edges vu, vw of G 0 such that v is a reflex vertex and 6 xvy &lt; . <p> The proof of the following theorem directly follows from Lemmas 4.3, 4.4, and from the observation that the maximum vertex degree of the block-cut-vertex tree of an extended octagon graph of degree k is k + 1. Theorem 4.2 For fi 2 <ref> [1; 2] </ref>, the sets G CO (fi) and G CO [fi] vary as shown in Table 1. Motivated by the existence of forbidden connected outerplanar graphs, we consider the the representability of outerplanar graphs with weak fi-drawings.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Overview Proximity drawings have received increasing attention within the graph drawing community (see, e.g., <ref> [20, 12, 10, 11, 3, 22, 2, 7, 19, 18] </ref>) because of their appealing graphical features: Edges are represented by straight lines, vertices not incident to a certain edge are drawn far apart from that edge, and groups of adjacent vertices tend to cluster together. <p> We say that a graph is fi-drawable if it has a both open and closed fi-drawings. The problem of characterizing fi-drawable trees has been studied in <ref> [3, 2] </ref> in the plane, and in [19] in 3-dimensional space. Lubiw and Sleumer [20, 22] initiated the study of fi-drawability of biconnected outerplanar graphs. <p> Observe that the interval 1 fi 2 is the most interesting for studying the fi-drawability of planar graphs, since, for fi &gt; 2, no fi-drawing can have triangular faces; for fi &lt; 1, fi-drawings are not guaranteed to be planar <ref> [2] </ref>. * We study convex fi-drawings. A convex drawing of a planar graph is one in which each face is a convex polygon.

Reference-contexts: Application areas such as VLSI routing and circuit layout have stimulated considerable research on both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visibility drawings in which vertices are segments or simple non overlapping polygons and the directions of visibility are parallel to the axes. (see, e.g., <ref> [1, 13, 23, 27] </ref>). A different type of proximity is based upon the concept of a region of influence (also referred to as a proximity region).

Reference-contexts: For example, in a Gabriel drawing <ref> [14] </ref>, the proximity region of u and v is the closed disk having u and v as antipodal points; in a relative neighborhood drawing [24] the proximity region is the intersection of the two open disks centered at u and at v and with distance d (u; v) as radius.

Reference-contexts: A general theorem is given that provides an upper bound on the number of biconnected components sharing a cut-vertex in a fi-drawable graph, for fi 2 [0; 1]. This is of particular interest since it is the first non-trivial result on the connectivity of fi-drawable graphs.

Reference-contexts: Also, proximity drawings are of practical interest in several application fields, such as pattern recognition and classification, image processing, geographic variation analysis, GIS, and computational morphology. For a survey on the different application areas of proximity drawings see <ref> [16] </ref>. A proximity drawing of a graph is has pairs of adjacent vertices relatively close together according to some proximity measure, while pairs of non adjacent vertices are relatively far apart. The choice of proximity measure determines the type of proximity drawing.

Reference-contexts: and a definition of proximity, is it possible to construct a proximity drawing of G? In this paper we answer the question for biconnected outerplanar graphs with respect to an infinite set of well-known region of influence based proximity drawings called fi-drawings, which were first introduced by Kirkpatrick and Radke <ref> [17] </ref> in the context of pattern recognition and computational morphology. fi-drawings are based on an infinite family of proximity regions, called fi-regions, each element of the family being identified by a value of the parameter fi (0 fi 1). <p> 2.2 The set of fi-regions Given a pair x; y of points in the plane, the open fi-region of influence of x and y, and the closed fi-region of influence of x and y, denoted by R (x; y; fi) and R [x; y; fi] respectively, are defined as follows <ref> [17] </ref>: 1. For 0 &lt; fi &lt; 1, R (x; y; fi) is the intersection of the two open disks of radius d (x; y)=(2fi) passing through both x and y. R [x; y; fi] is the intersection of the two corresponding closed disks. 2.

Reference-contexts: A convex drawing of a planar graph is one in which each face is a convex polygon. Convex drawings are an important object of study in graph drawing because of their aesthetic appeal (see, e.g., <ref> [9, 5, 8, 25, 4] </ref>). We provide here a negative result, by showing that there exist biconnected outerplanar graphs that do not admit any convex fi-drawing.
