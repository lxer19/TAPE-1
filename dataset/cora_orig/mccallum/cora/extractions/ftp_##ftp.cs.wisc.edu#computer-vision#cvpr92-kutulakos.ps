Abstract: We present an approach for recovering surface shape from the occluding contour using an active (i.e., moving) observer. It is based on a relation between the geometries of a surface in a scene and its occluding contour: If the viewing direction of the observer is along a principal direction for a surface point whose projection is on the contour, surface shape (i.e., curvature) at the surface point can be recovered from the contour. Unlike previous approaches for recovering shape from the occluding contour, we use an observer that purposefully changes viewpoint in order to achieve a well-defined geometric relationship with respect to a 3D shape prior to its recognition. We show that there is a simple and efficient viewing strategy that allows the observer to align the viewing direction with one of the two principal directions for a point on the surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be easily implemented and can provide reliable shape information.

Reference-contexts: One common feature of these approaches is the use of known viewer motion in order to recover quantitative properties of the scene such as surface curvature <ref> [1] </ref>. Recently, however, there has been considerable interest in employing simple observer behaviors that either make the recovery of scene properties easier [2], or combine simple behaviors in order to perform complex tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance [3]. <p> The issue here is how to accurately measure such changes in the contour's geometry with small viewing direction changes. For example, we must be able to measure the velocity and acceleration of surface points entering and leaving the rim <ref> [1, 7] </ref>, a problem that requires first- and second-order differentiation operations of image-computable quantities, and hence is sensitive to noise. The basic assumption used by all of the above approaches was that the viewing direction is arbitrary. <p> In fact k n and k o determine the second fundamental form at p. This was the main idea behind the surface reconstruction approach of Cipolla and Blake <ref> [1] </ref>. The above results are important but they also imply that if we have no additional information about the shape of the viewed surface, the information provided by the occluding contour is primarily qualitative.

Reference-contexts: We show that this relationship is characterized by specific image-computable quantities and enables an analysis similar to the one of Krotkov <ref> [4] </ref>. In addition, our approach does not require any knowledge of observer velocities or object models and assumes the use of a world-centered coordinate frame. It is well-known that the occluding contour is a valuable source of information about surface shape [5, 6]. <p> If it increases, continue to change the viewing direction in the same way so that e 2 will be reached first. If it decreases, move the viewing direction in the opposite way. Step 2: Continue moving in the same direction (or perform a binary search along the lines of <ref> [4] </ref>) until k o reaches a maximum. This viewpoint corresponds to e 2 and therefore the observer can stop moving and use the current value of k o for k n 1 . Step 3: Measure the total change of direction between the initial and final viewing direction.

Reference-contexts: In addition, our approach does not require any knowledge of observer velocities or object models and assumes the use of a world-centered coordinate frame. It is well-known that the occluding contour is a valuable source of information about surface shape <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. The occluding contour is the projection of the visible rim, the one-dimensional set of points that separates the visible from the hidden parts of a surface. There have been several approaches to deriving information about surface geometry from the occluding contour. <p> The dependency of the occluding contour's geometry on the surface severely constrains the surface's geometry (e.g., <ref> [5, 6] </ref>). The major problem, though, is that the occluding contour is created through a projection process and in general the information it provides is ambiguous, i.e., several different surface rims can project to the same occluding contour. <p> A slight change in viewpoint will affect the geometry (i.e., curvature) and possibly the topology of the rim, and hence the occluding contour. Moreover, the set of rim points changes and therefore new constraining information about the surface shape becomes available. Giblin and Weiss <ref> [5] </ref> showed that if we know how the geometry of the occluding contour changes with viewpoint, we can derive a parameterization of the surface and hence determine its shape. The issue here is how to accurately measure such changes in the contour's geometry with small viewing direction changes. <p> occluding contour at q, then k o and the Gaussian curvature K = k n 1 k n 2 of S at p have the same sign [6], and (3) if k n is the normal curvature of S at p along ~, then K = k n k o <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Because K is defined as the product of two curvatures on the surface (i.e., k n 1 ; k n 2 ), these results suggest that if we know k o then we only need to measure one curvature on the surface instead of two.

Reference-contexts: However, when the observer can actively control the viewing direction, we can exploit the existence of directions that allow the derivation of complete information about the surface. We show this by presenting three simple corollaries to a result of Blaschke (proofs can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>). Blaschke's result is analogous to Euler's formula and relates the curvature of the occluding contour with the principal curvatures of S at the rim: Theorem 1 (Blaschke [8]) Let be the angle between ~ and e 1 . <p> The following proposition shows that (a) there are at least some points on the visible rim of S that cannot be occluded by S if the observer changes direction as described above, and (b) these points are easily detected on the occluding contour (see <ref> [9] </ref> for the proof): on the occluding contour of a candlestick show the points that cannot become occluded while changing viewing direction in their tangent planes. <p> In fact, the direction and position of the axis can also be determined by recovering the principal curvatures for two points on the rim of a side view <ref> [9] </ref>. It is also possible to extend the above discussion to the case of regular, straight, homogeneous generalized cylinders, by aligning the viewing direction with the principal direction of points belonging to geodesic parallels [9]. <p> determined by recovering the principal curvatures for two points on the rim of a side view <ref> [9] </ref>. It is also possible to extend the above discussion to the case of regular, straight, homogeneous generalized cylinders, by aligning the viewing direction with the principal direction of points belonging to geodesic parallels [9]. In either case, the observer must choose between moving towards the principal direction of minimum curvature or moving towards the one of maximum curvature. <p> Therefore, we must change viewing direction in some other plane containing e 2 . The important issues here are (1) which plane should be selected for changing the viewing direction, and (2) how much should the viewing direction change in that plane? We show in <ref> [9] </ref> that if the selected plane P is the normal plane (i.e., the plane defined by the viewing direction and the surface normal at p) and if the viewing direction change on this plane is small, then the viewing direction adjustments during the shape recovery step will in fact be smooth

We are currently investigating an approach that enables the observer to change viewpoint in order to obtain a face-on view of a planar curve. We are also trying to extend our results to perspective projection and are investigating possible uses of this approach in the context of active surface-exploration.
