Title: Noise Strategies for Improving Local Search  
Abstract: Bart Selman, Henry A. Kautz, and Bram Cohen AT&T Bell Laboratories Murray Hill, NJ 07974 fselman, kautz, coheng@research.att.com This paper appears in Proceedings of AAAI-94, Seattle, WA, July 1994. Abstract It has recently been shown that local search is surprisingly good at finding satisfying assignments for certain computationally hard classes of CNF formulas. The performance of basic local search methods can be further enhanced by introducing mechanisms for escaping from local minima in the search space. We will compare three such mechanisms: simulated annealing, random noise, and a strategy called "mixed random walk". We show that mixed random walk is the superior strategy. We also present results demonstrating the effectiveness of local search with walk for solving circuit synthesis and circuit diagnosis problems. Finally, we demonstrate that mixed random walk improves upon the best known methods for solving MAX-SAT problems.

Reference-contexts: The last one is similar to basic GSAT with a form of a tabu list <ref> (Glover 1989) </ref>. They showed that "zsamd" consistently outperformed the other approaches. We repeated their main experiments using GSAT with walk. The problem instances are randomly generated 3SAT instances. For each problem size, 50 problems were randomly generated, and each problem was solved 100 times using different random initial assignments.

Reference-contexts: the best possible local move. 3 If the only possible move for GSAT is uphill, it will make such a move, but such "forced" uphill moves are quite rare, and are not effective in escaping from local minima or plateaus. 4 This form of annealing corresponds to the Metropolis algorithm <ref> (Jerrum 1992) </ref>. See Pinkas and Dechter (1992), for an interesting modification of the basic annealing scheme. Note that the "walk" moves can be uphill.

Reference-contexts: In Selman et al. (1992), it was shown that GSAT substantially outperforms backtracking search procedures, such as the Davis-Putnam procedure, on various classes of formulas, including hard randomly generated formulas and SAT encodings of graph coloring problems <ref> (Johnson et al. 1991) </ref>. As noted above, local minima in the search space of a combinatorial problem are the primary obstacle to the application of local search methods. GSAT's use 2 A clause is a disjunction of literals. A literal is a propositional variable or its negation.

Reference-contexts: One might speculate that the good performance of the random walk strategy is a consequence of our choice of test instances. We therefore also ran experiments using several other classes of problem instances, developed by transforming other combinatorial problems into satisfiability instances. In particular, we considered problems from planning <ref> (Kautz and Selman 1992) </ref> and circuit synthesis (Kamath et al. 1991; 1993). These experiments again demonstrate that mixed random walk is the superior escape mechanism. <p> The other two strategies also give an improved value of R over basic GSAT but the effect is less dramatic. Planning Problems As a second example of the effectiveness of the various escape strategies, we consider encodings of blocks-world planning problems <ref> (Kautz and Selman 1992) </ref>. Such formulas are very challenging for basic GSAT. Examination of the best assignments found when GSAT fails to find a satisfying assignment indicates that difficulties arise from extremely deep local minima.

Reference-contexts: We will now discuss two mechanisms for making such moves. 3 Simulated Annealing Simulated annealing introduces uphill moves into local search by using a noise model based on statistical mechanics <ref> (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983) </ref>. We employ the annealing algorithm defined in Johnson et al. (1991): Start with a randomly generated truth assignment. Repeatedly pick a random variable, and compute ffi, the change in the number of unsatisfied clauses when that variable is flipped.
