Reference-contexts: makes the generation of the corresponding substrings possible and facilitates a consistency check (e.g., pos-from must a positive integer number less than pos-to, pos-to must be greater than pos-from and equal or less than the sentence length.). 3.4.2 Database System The database is administered in the programming language awk (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: student the computer nominal and prepositional arguments with semantically empty (9) or non empty prepositions (10): (9) Der Vorschlag bringt den Studenten auf den Losungsweg. the suggestion takes the student to the solution 3 At the basis of our list were collections to be found in the literature, such as <ref> [2] </ref>, [5], [6], [7], [9] and [12].

Reference-contexts: According to the Entity-Relationship (ER) terminology (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>), we can identify two entity types and one relationship type which are specified as follows: 1. Sentence, an entity type, the major concept of the data model.

Reference-contexts: We have attempted to address the issue of syntactic correctness head-on. Hewlett-Packard Laboratories compiled a test suite of approximately 1; 500 sentences which it distributed at the Public Forum on Evaluating Natural Language Systems at the 1987 Meeting of the Assocation for Computational Linguistics <ref> [4] </ref>. That effort differed from the present one in that it tried to evaluate semantics and pragmatics, as well as syntax, and in that it consisted essentially of sentences without annotated properties. The sentences were not organized into a database.

Reference-contexts: There have been several related efforts concerned with English syntax. Guida and Mauri <ref> [8] </ref> report on attempts to evaluate system performance for natural language processing systems (n.b., not merely syntax) in which they attempt to finesse the issue of correctness (which we argue to be central) by measuring user satisfaction. We have attempted to address the issue of syntactic correctness head-on.

Reference-contexts: The Natural Language group at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman Systems and Technologies Corporation circulated a corpus of approximately 3; 200 sample database queries formulated in English at the 1989 DARPA Workshop on Evaluating Natural Language <ref> [10] </ref>. The emphasis here, too, was on system (natural language understanding) performance, rather than specializations, but most of their examples seem to come from actual trial use of a natural language interface program, which gives their work added value.

Reference-contexts: That effort differed from the present one in that it tried to evaluate semantics and pragmatics, as well as syntax, and in that it consisted essentially of sentences without annotated properties. The sentences were not organized into a database. Read et al. <ref> [11] </ref> advocate a "sourcebook" approach, in which fewer examples are submitted to much closer scrutiny. The closer scrutiny doesn't seem subject to automation, at least at present.
