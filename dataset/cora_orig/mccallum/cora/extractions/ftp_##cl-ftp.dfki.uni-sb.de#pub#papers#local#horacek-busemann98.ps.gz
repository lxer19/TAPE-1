Abstract: Although research in natural language generation has led to the development of numerous methods and reusable software tools, we feel that building comparably simple application systems still involves more hand-crafted skills than systematic methodology. In our view, this is due to the fact that most available tools are oriented towards contributing to a general purpose generation system rather than supporting the economic development of dedicated applications. In order to improve this situation, we present a methodology for developing application-oriented report generation with limited effort, emphasizing domain- and user-specific preferences over general-purpose communicative principles. Key parts in our approach comprise building an ontologically minimal initial representation on the basis of user parameters and associated domain data, the successive refinement of this initial representation by making implicit information explicit enough for fleshing out selected text and sentence patterns, and the opportunistic combination of linguistically motivated methods with template-based generation. This methodology should enable system developers to build application-oriented report gen erators more systematically and with reduced effort.

Reference-contexts: In our view, this is due to the fact that most available tools (e.g. SURGE [ Elhadad and Robin, 1996 ] , KPML <ref> [ Bateman, 1997 ] </ref> ) are based on in-depth approaches to NLG contributing to a general purpose generation system rather than supporting the economic development of dedicated applications. <p> We looked for simple and application-oriented solutions, at the same time envisioning systematicity and a methodological development process. 3 The URL is http://www-temsis.dfki.uni-sb.de/. We refrained from reusing large in-depth NLG resources such as SURGE [ Elhadad and Robin, 1996 ] or KPML <ref> [ Bateman, 1997 ] </ref> , because their adaptation to the needs of TEMSIS would have required considerable effort for developing interfaces to the feeding components. Moreover, the use of such resources within relatively small applications like the present one means a certain overshot.

Reference-contexts: While in-depth approaches to NLG are indispensable for scientific progress in the field, we suggest that certain types of applications can, at present, be built more successfully by systematically adopting more shallow techniques, which emphasize domain- and user-specific preferences over general-purpose communicative principles (cf. <ref> [ Busemann and Horacek, 1998 ] </ref> for a more extensive argumentation). Motivated by the application-related deficits of general tools, we have developed a methodology for shallow multi-lingual report generation. <p> However, PLANDOC has a number of more powerful components, such as the sorts of aggregation it can deal with, and it has available to it the generality of SURGE. In this context, the limitations and prospects of our approach can be assessed as follows (cf. <ref> [ Busemann and Horacek, 1998 ] </ref> for more details): Aggregation techniques can easily be extended, although their formulation would require rather accessing properties of domain parameters than evalu ating in-depth linguistic features.

Reference-contexts: The development of the TEMSIS report generator had to be carried out under rather tight resource constraints. With an investigation of eight person months, the system had to be built from scratch in large parts. We decided to reuse the TG/2 production system for shallow linguistic verbalization <ref> [ Busemann, 1996 ] </ref> as well as some of its subgrammars including e.g. rules for temporal expressions. We looked for simple and application-oriented solutions, at the same time envisioning systematicity and a methodological development process. 3 The URL is http://www-temsis.dfki.uni-sb.de/. <p> The productions consist of conditioned rewrite rules with a context-free backbone. Their right-hand side consists of canned text elements, lexemes, or non-terminal symbols corresponding to recursive rule activation. This way, canned texts, template techniques and context-free grammars are integrated into a single formalism <ref> [ Busemann, 1996 ] </ref> . The string of template elements in (6) 4 corresponds to the right-hand side of a rule verbalizing average values.

Reference-contexts: Most of these operations are data-driven utilizing schemata as they were elaborated for linguistically motivated lexicalization <ref> [ Horacek, 1996 ] </ref> . In contrast to that work, some of our schemata are purely application-oriented, and they are 'heavier' in terms of the number of schema parameters and the size of the structures covered. In TEMSIS, we use twelve schema classes and about hundred instantiations.

Reference-contexts: An attribute value structure, for structured influence factors with internal dependencies; an example is a time specification (see (3)). Altogether, this categorization imposes some sort of minimal ontology on the initial proposition representation to encapsulate 'domain communication knowledge' <ref> [ Kittredge et al., 1991 ] </ref> , and it makes local parameter and data dependencies explicit. 3.2 Phase 2: Recasting information The second processing phase, recasting the information, manipulates initial representations of assertion structures like (3).

Reference-contexts: All conventions and preferences are interpreted much more directly and concretely than typical rhetorical parameters for experimental systems, such as "colloquial", "verbose" etc., so that reasoning about them is not required. Our methodology covers reports of a complexity comparable to those produced by Ana <ref> [ Kukich, 1983 ] </ref> , FOG [ Boubeau et al., 1990 ] , IDAS [ Reiter et al., 1995 ] , and it may in large parts be extendible to those produced by PLANDOC [ McKeown et al., 1994 ] .

Ana is the first natural language report generator, and the kind of texts it produces can still be considered valuable today. However, Ana is implemented as a widely unstructured rule-based system, which does not seem to be easily extendable and portable.

Reference-contexts: Building such a draft specification is based on human pre-analysis to build schemata that bear some similarities to McKeown's <ref> [ McKeown, 1985 ] </ref> . Our schemata can also represent conditionals, but they are flat structures without recursion, and their instantiation is geared by user-based specifications rather than by linguistically motivated concepts such as focus constraints.

Reference-contexts: For a shallow verbalization component such as TG/2 (also some of the so-called intermediate techniques in IDAS <ref> [ Reiter et al., 1995 ] </ref> fall under this type), bridging that difference is transferred to the verbalization component's grammar rules; For an in-depth realization component such as SURGE, structure-changing rules should take care of bridging that ontological difference. <p> Our methodology covers reports of a complexity comparable to those produced by Ana [ Kukich, 1983 ] , FOG [ Boubeau et al., 1990 ] , IDAS <ref> [ Reiter et al., 1995 ] </ref> , and it may in large parts be extendible to those produced by PLANDOC [ McKeown et al., 1994 ] .
