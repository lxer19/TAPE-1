Title: Adaptive Web Sites: an AI Challenge  
Author: Mike Perkowitz Oren Etzioni

Abstract: The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in user interface design. First, different visitors have distinct goals. Second, even a single visitor may have different needs at different times. Much of the information at the site may also be dynamic or time-dependent. Third, as the site grows and evolves, its original design may no longer be appropriate. Finally, a site may be designed for a particular purpose but used in unexpected ways. Web servers record data about user interactions and accumulate this data over time. We believe that AI techniques can be used to examine user access logs in order to automatically improve the site. We challenge the AI community to create adaptive web sites: sites that automatically improve their organization and presentation based on user access data. Several unrelated research projects in plan recognition, machine learning, knowledge representation, and user modeling have begun to explore aspects of this problem. We hope that posing this challenge explicitly will bring these projects together and stimulate fundamental AI research. Success would have a broad and highly visible impact on the web and the AI community.

Reference-contexts: Many advances in artificial intelligence, both practical and theoretical, have come about in response to such task-oriented approaches. The quest to build a better chess-playing computer, for example, has led to many advances in search techniques (e.g., <ref> [ Anantharaman et al., 1990 ] </ref> ). The autonomous land vehicle project at CMU [ Thorpe, 1990 ] has resulted in not only a highway-cruising vehicle but also breakthroughs in vision, robotics, and neural networks.

Reference-contexts: For example, we might present our users with a "tour guide" (as in <ref> [ Armstrong et al., 1995 ] </ref> ) and have changes to the site be presented as the agent's suggestions. Alternatively, we might annotate our HTML with directives stating where and how changes can be made. <p> Second, virtually all existing web sites are not adaptive, yet data to support the learning process is readily available in web server logs. Clearly, here is an opportunity for AI! Finally, a number of disconnected projects in machine learning <ref> [ Armstrong et al., 1995 ] </ref> , data mining, knowledge representation, plan recognition [ Kautz, 1987; Pollack, 1990 ] , and user modeling [ Fink et al., 1996 ] have begun to explore aspects of the problem. <p> The WebWatcher <ref> [ Armstrong et al., 1995 ] </ref> (see http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ ~webwatcher/) learns to predict what links users will follow on a particular page as a function of their specified interests.

Reference-contexts: The quest to build autonomous software agents has similarly led to both practical and theoretical advances. For example, the Internet Softbot project has yielded both deployed softbots and advances in planning, knowledge representation, and machine learning <ref> [ Etzioni, 1996 ] </ref> . We believe that the goal of creating self-improving web sites is a similar task: one whose accomplishment will require breakthroughs in different areas of AI. In this paper we discuss possible approaches to this task and how to evaluate the community's progress.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, we might annotate our HTML with directives stating where and how changes can be made. Or we may provide semantic information about the entire site, allowing the agent to reason about the relationships between everything, perhaps representing the entire site as a database (see <ref> [ Fernandez et al., 1997 ] </ref> ). * How do we effectively collaborate with a human webmaster to suggest and justify potential adaptations? Suppose the human webmaster is still responsible for the final product. <p> One way to provide meta-information is to represent the site's content in a formal framework with precisely defined semantics such as a database or a semantic network. This approach is pioneered by the STRUDEL web-site management system <ref> [ Fernandez et al., 1997 ] </ref> which attempts to separate the information available at a web site from its graphical presentation. Instead of manipulating web sites at the level of pages and links, web sites may be specified using STRUDEL's view-definition language.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, here is an opportunity for AI! Finally, a number of disconnected projects in machine learning [ Armstrong et al., 1995 ] , data mining, knowledge representation, plan recognition [ Kautz, 1987; Pollack, 1990 ] , and user modeling <ref> [ Fink et al., 1996 ] </ref> have begun to explore aspects of the problem. Framing the problem explicitly in this paper could help bring these disparate approaches together. We pose our challenge as a particular task to be accomplished by any means available. <p> Challenge: Can we formalize user navigation of the web as a planning process that is amenable to goal recognition? Do user actions on the web carry enough evidence of their purpose? The AVANTI Project <ref> [ Fink et al., 1996 ] </ref> (see http://zeus.gmd.de/ projects/avanti.html) focuses on dynamic customization based on users' needs and tastes. As with the WebWatcher, AVANTI relies partly on users providing information about themselves when they enter the site.

Reference-contexts: MCF is an attempt to establish a standard for meta-content annotation for the web. When a user visits an MCF-enhanced site with an MCF-enabled browser, she can choose to navigate the site in a three-dimensional representation of the site's structure, as determined from the site's MCF annotation. SHOE <ref> [ Luke et al., 1997 ] </ref> (at http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/plus/SHOE/), takes a different tack. SHOE is a language for adding simple ontologies to web pages. SHOE adds basic ontological declarations to HTML; a page can refer to a particular ontology and declare classifications for itself and relations to other pages.

Reference-contexts: If we guarantee that each transformation improves the quality of the site, we are performing a hillclimbing search. Challenge: How large is this search space and what is an appropriate search strategy? Can we re structure the space to avoid searching large portions of it? In <ref> [ Perkowitz and Etzioni, 1997 ] </ref> we sketch the design of a system with a repertoire of transformations that aim to improve a site's organization; transformations include rearranging and highlighting links as well as synthesizing new pages.
