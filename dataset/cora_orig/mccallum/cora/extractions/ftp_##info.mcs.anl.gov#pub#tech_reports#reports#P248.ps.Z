Abstract: Summary): We continue the work of Part I, treating in detail the theory of numerical quadrature over a square [0; 1) 2 using an m 2 copy, Q (m) , of a one-point quadrature rule. As before, we determine the nature of an asymptotic expansion for the quadrature error functional Q (m) F IF in inverse powers of m and related functions, valid for specified classes of the integrand function F . The extreme case treated here is one in which the integrand function has a full-corner algebraic singularity. This has the form x y r ae (x; y). Here , , and ae need not be integer, and r ae is (x 2 + y 2 )

Reference-contexts: As is well known, the coefficients can be expressed in terms of double integrals. We use a concise notation for these, which was introduced in Part I and is useful subsequently. We set Definition 1 (I.3.19) t j;k (m; F ) b d Z b dx c <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> [ 2 ] Here 1 and 2 take the values 1 or 0 only. <p> The subtraction functions used are OE 1 w (x; y) and OE 2 w (x; y). The first is the function given in (I.3.29) and designed so that, when 0 &lt; a &lt; b &lt; 1, the function OE 1 bkc (x; y) is integrable over <ref> [1; 1) fi [a; b] </ref>, and F (k;q) (x; y) OE 1 (k;q) (x; y) is integrable over [0; 1] fi [a; b]. <p> The first is the function given in (I.3.29) and designed so that, when 0 &lt; a &lt; b &lt; 1, the function OE 1 bkc (x; y) is integrable over [1; 1) fi [a; b], and F (k;q) (x; y) OE 1 (k;q) (x; y) is integrable over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [a; b]. <p> n [: :] bkc ) 1 1 [: :] bkc ) 1 1 o ~ R (1) p (H 2 ; Q fffi ; ) = 1 bpc1 X 1 +` ) 1 Here we have set U k (m; F 0 ) d [0; 2 ] 0 c s=s <ref> [1; 2 ] </ref> a s 0 1 c t p;k (m; F 0 ) 1 d where s and p can take any values satisfying 0 s &lt; 0 + 1 &lt; p, a = 0; 2; 1 when &lt; 0, = 0 or &gt; 0 respectively, and F 0 is <p> There, when c and d are omitted, it is assumed that d = 1 and c = a k (+ae`)1 ; that is, c is chosen to make the integral converge in the y direction. A similar function, V <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> a , is defined in (I.3.21a). This may be obtained from (13) by interchanging the roles of x and y. <p> We note that when and ae=2 are integer, the integrand function is of the correct form for Sidi's theorem to apply; while when and are integer, the expansion is also known (Lyness [2] <ref> [1] </ref>). Our derivation of the expansion for general , , and ae is by no means straightforward. <p> Inserting these into (7) and collecting like terms, we find ~ B s (1; m) = k=0 t k;sk (1; OE 1 1 1 + t k;sk (1; F OE 1 0 1 ; (17) ~ E +1+t (1; m) = `=0 <ref> [1] </ref> +` ) m ~ R p (1; m) = k=0 t k;pk (1; OE 1 1 1 + t k;sk (1; F OE 1 0 1 ; (19) p (1; m) = `=0 b+`+1c;p U pb+`+1c (1; F 1 1 : (20) We note that these are obtained from (9-12) <p> Q fffi ; F ) = bpc1 X E +1+t (H 2 ; Q fffi ; F ) R (1) p (1; H 2 ; Q fffi ; F ); (34) C +1+t fl (H 2 ; Q fffi ; F ) = ffi ft fl g t fl `=0 <ref> [1] </ref> +` ) 1 = ffi ft fl g U 0 (1; F 1 2 : (35) Here, ffi 0 = 1 and ffi ff = 0 when ff 6= 0. <p> In addition, if the rule Q in (54) above is of polynomial degree d, B s given by (55) vanishes for s 2 <ref> [1; d] </ref>. In fact, the contribution to C s denoted by C (1;2) also satisfies these conditions. However, the other contributions to C s do not. In the special case in which and are both integers, C s satisfies these conditions.

Reference-contexts: Recently, however, significant progress has been reported. The theory has been extended to integrand functions having end-point algebraic and logarithmic singularities (Navot [5] [6]), to multidimensional hyper-cubes and simplices, and to some of the more sophisticated multidimensional algebraic and logarithmic singularities (Lyness <ref> [2] </ref>, Sidi [7]).

Our derivation of the expansion for general , , and ae is by no means straightforward. It requires nearly all the results in Part I and constitutes an extensive generalization of the approach in [2]. 2 The Full-Corner Algebraic Singularity Elements of the Expan sion In this section and in Section 3, we treat the integrand function F (x; y) = x y r ae (x; y); &gt; 1; &gt; 1; + + ae &gt; 2; (14) where r ae (x; y) is homogeneous of <p> By its definition (13), the U coefficient is a sum of terms each of the form t <ref> [ 1 ; 2 ] </ref> +` ) 1 m with various values of s and 1 . <p> These involve in total many different integrals, each of which is expressed in terms of (4).

However, the other contributions to C s do not. In the special case in which and are both integers, C s satisfies these conditions. This is the case treated in Lyness <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 Applications These asymptotic expansions have a natural application in cubature by extrapolation, particularly in the context of the finite element. We have carried out extensive numerical experiments, both to verify the expansions numerically and to assess their utility in the cubature context. <p> Other extensions to integrand functions having logarithmic singularities are clearly possible, but require detailed justification along the lines of Section 5 of Lyness <ref> [2] </ref>. Our understanding is that expansions of this type are needed to handle elements required in some of the more recent applications of the boundary element method. 16 Most of this work was carried out during a three-month visit by one author to Argonne National Laboratory in 1979.

Reference-contexts: It is trivial to write these down in the case in which g (x; y) is a polynomial. Extensions to integration over a triangle, rather than a square, follow the lines of a similar generalization described in Lyness and Monegato <ref> [4] </ref> and lead to an expansion of precisely the same form as (57) above. Other extensions to integrand functions having logarithmic singularities are clearly possible, but require detailed justification along the lines of Section 5 of Lyness [2].
