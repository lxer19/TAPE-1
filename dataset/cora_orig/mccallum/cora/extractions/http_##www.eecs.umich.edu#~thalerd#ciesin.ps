Reference-contexts: Similar to the scheme used by <ref> [1] </ref>, when data becomes available after an old shared key has timed out, the entity holding the data asks the requesting entity to reauthenticate. Once this is done, the data is delivered. This will be discussed in more detail in section 4.3.2. <p> In order to do this, we introduce the concept of a security callback. Security callbacks are similar to the scheme proposed by Birrell in <ref> [1] </ref>, whereby a request for authenticator is used when a server cannot find a valid key to use to communicate with the sender of a query. From section 4.2, a subquery is sent to a server with: 5.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to circumvent most conventional security mechanisms [], and complicated protocols designed to enhance security have sometimes been discovered to be in error only after they have been in use for some time <ref> [2] </ref>. In the context of CIESIN's Information Cooperative, misuse can have serious consequences. This work addresses some important Information Technology issues which arise in trying to ensure that access constraints are respected as information flows within and across CIESIN Information Cooperative member organizations. Let us first consider the CIESIN situation. <p> This will be discussed in more detail in section 4.4. 14 Chapter 4 The Protocol 4.1 Notation We use a notation based on that described by Burrows, Abadi, and Needham in <ref> [2] </ref> to describe the syntax and semantics of our protocols. A brief summary follows. Each server security agent S i has its own private key P K 1 i and public key P K i . <p> In order to do this, we must first start with some notation. 5.1 Notation We again use a notation based on that described by Burrows, Ababi, and Need-ham in <ref> [2] </ref>. For clarity in explanation, we also include a few concepts from Sandhu in [5] and divide a "belief" by an entity into three types which we will call P believes X, P knows X, and P generates X. A brief summary of notation beyond that of Section 4.1 follows. <p> P password pq * ) Q: The formula X is a secret, such as a password, known only 23 to P and Q. Only P and Q may use X to prove their identities to one another. For logical postulates we have the five given formally in <ref> [2] </ref> and summaried below, and add one additional one. (1) The message-meaning rules state that if a message is encrypted with a known formula, it follows that the sender can be determined to be a principal who also knows the formula. (2) The nonce-verification rule expresses the check that a message <p> M controls Q i ; F i R13) S i believes C controls Q i ; F i A database server will accept and process queries from CIESIN or a client, that is, from anyone that can authenticate to the server. 5.2.1 Analysis of Authentication Using the methods detailed by <ref> [2] </ref>, we will analyze the above protocol. We start with a detailed example, and then follow with the results obtained from other messages using a similar process. 1. <p> The protocol will use fast encryption whenever possible, keep data private where required, and continue in the face of key timeouts and reaching monetary limits. We have also provided an extension to the logic of authentication developed by <ref> [2] </ref> to support one-way encryption. We have used this extension to show that public data may still be sent securely. 32

This may be the case if the image becomes dated quickly, for instance. Other data objects may require privacy.
