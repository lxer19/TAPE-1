Abstract: A new numerical method for studying one dimensional fluid flow through pipelines is presented and analyzed. This work extends in a certain direction the collocation method described by Luskin["An Approximation Procedure for Nonsymmetric, Nonlinear Hyperbolic Systems with Integral Boundary Conditions", SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 1976.]. The pressure and velocity of an isothermal fluid in a pipeline can be described by a coupled pair of nonlinear first order hyperbolic partial differential equations. When thermal effects are important a third equation for temperature is added. While Luskin's method works well for the isothermal situation he discussed, it does not apply in certain common cases when thermal effects are modeled. The analysis of this new method shows how the difficulties that come from the application of standard collocation can be overcome. Experiments indicate that this method is a substantial improvement over standard collocation. It also describes an approach to analyzing nonlinear evolution equations with smooth solutions which produces convergence theorems about the nonlinear system from the corresponding linear theorems with relatively little extra work. This technique also yields an H 1 estimate in the isothermal case.

Reference-contexts: This gives a possibly non-uniform partition of [0; t ] into M time steps.

In this case there is no need for an induction, the standard Gronwall inequality applies and the convergence is for all time. In the nonlinear non-degenerate case, Luskin [2] proved an L 2 estimate for the case = 1=2. <p> Convergence Rates steady state small waves L 2 L 1 L 2 L 1 pressure 2.0 1.9 0.9 0.9 velocity 1.1 1.2 0.9 0.9 temperature 1.3 1.4 1.0 0.9 25 8 Error Analysis Note: for an easier to read proof of an important special case, the reader is referred to <ref> [1] </ref>, which treats the linear case of the degenerate problem. Before launching into the details of the proof we give a brief overview. The a-priori error bound will be based on using the discrete scheme on U W where W is a discrete interpolant of u.

Reference-contexts: Thermal modeling may also be important in attempting to optimize pipeline usage for maximum economic utility. Isothermal fluid flow in pipelines is described by a pair of coupled first order nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations for pressure and velocity. In 1978 Mitchell Luskin <ref> [2] </ref> described and analyzed a numerical method applicable to a large class of systems, including the isothermal pipeline case. The method relies upon the fact that the eigenvalues of the matrix which determines the characteristic directions are both bounded far away from zero. <p> In this case there is no need for an induction, the standard Gronwall inequality applies and the convergence is for all time. In the nonlinear non-degenerate case, Luskin <ref> [2] </ref> proved an L 2 estimate for the case = 1=2. The same proof I use for the degenerate case yields the following H 1 result in the non-degenerate case when &gt; 1=2. Theorem 3 (Non-degenerate Case) Consider the non-degenerate case of equation (8). Let assumptions 2 and 3 hold. <p> Remark 2 (More General Boundary Conditions) Our analysis holds without change for other simple configurations of boundary conditions such as specifying velocity at each end of the pipe rather than pressure at each end. Luskin <ref> [2] </ref> treats 19 20 21 22 very general nonlinear boundary conditions in the non-degenerate case, including ones involving time integrals. We analyze the boundary conditions using a simplified version of Luskin's analysis, but we do not treat the complexities he considers.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we make certain assumptions about the nature of the solutions which appear reasonable for pipelines. In particular, we assume that the flow speed is much smaller than the speed of sound and that no shocks are present. 3 Luskin and Blake <ref> [3] </ref> have demonstrated the existence of smooth solutions for systems such as the isothermal equations. We state the equations for the Plug Flow model of pipeline fluid flow; we are outside the region of laminar flow but in a regime where shocks are not generally observed.

Reference-contexts: The equations are to be interpreted in some consistent set of units. The plug flow model has been validated in engineering practice for pipelines carrying such diverse fluids as natural gas, crude oil and water; see <ref> [5] </ref> for references. These equations can be thought of as forming a differential-algebraic system.
