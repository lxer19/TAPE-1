Abstract: This research aims to demonstrate that a solution for artificial ant problem [4] is very likely to be non-general and relying on the specific characteristics of the Santa Fe trail. It then presents a consistent method which promotes producing general solutions. Using the concepts of training and testing from machine learning research, the method can be useful in producing general behaviours for simulation environments.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [3] </ref>, the artificial ant has to traverse the John Muir trail placed in a grid world. The ant's task is to move from cell to cell traversing as many cells in the trail as possible in 200 time steps. <p> The results indicated that both representation types can enable an artificial ant to traverse the entire cells of the trail by collecting all the food. However, the degree of the generality of the solutions is not clear. In their paper <ref> [3] </ref> the authors explicitly state that the aim of the experiment is not to evolve "a general trail-following ability" but an ability to traverse the particular trail. <p> In fact, at the end of their experiments, this was exactly what was found: `Such efficient logic seems exquisitely adapted to the features of this particular trail, and suggest that evolution has had effect of "compiling" knowledge of this environment into structure of the organism' <ref> [3] </ref>. For example, the best ant developed an evolutionary bias towards right-turning. If this best individual is tested on several similar trails which may require more left turns or other characteristics, the performance can be expected to decrease drastically.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Genetic programming (GP) <ref> [4, 5] </ref> research concentrates on evolving programs which produce an exact or a close solution for a particular problem. For those problems involving simulations of an agent's behaviour in an environment, the generality of the solutions is desired. <p> For those problems involving simulations of an agent's behaviour in an environment, the generality of the solutions is desired. Some of the early problems of GP involve one fitness case where `learning' is evaluated based on the performance in one static environment <ref> [4] </ref>. Such an approach can easily result in a solution that only captures particular characteristics of the environment. For some simulations, a random starting point is chosen for the agents. <p> If this best individual is tested on several similar trails which may require more left turns or other characteristics, the performance can be expected to decrease drastically. Thus, the authors imply that finding a specific solution for a particular environment will possibly result in a non-general solution. In <ref> [4] </ref> it is stated that a solution found for the artificial ant problem may result in a generalised behaviour for the artificial ant: `... <p> is sufficiently representative for this particular problem to allow the ant to learn to navigate this trail and reasonable generalisations of this trail' (<ref> [4] </ref>, pp. 150). The term `reasonable generalisations' does not clearly state a degree of gen-eralisation that can be expected from a solution of the ant problem. In [4] the Santa Fe trail is used. It is characterised as a trail with single and double gaps, and single, double, and triple gaps at the corners and other trails sharing the same characteristics but appearing in a different order can be considered as variations of the Santa Fe trail. <p> The second question is more complicated and refers to a range of changes among trails and to a degree of predictive generalisation. 4 Experimental Set-up The first set of experiments presented in the next two sections are based on replication of the artificial ant problem presented in <ref> [4] </ref> which is provided as an example problem as part of a GP application development package: lil-gp. 1 The summary of the problem is presented in Figure 2. No changes have been introduced to the parameters used in the original problem definition provided as part of lil-gp package.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the learning achieved may not produce a general solution but a robust solution for a given environment. Although the need for producing systems with generalisation ability is much recognised in the GP community, research dealing primarily with generalisation is limited to a few papers. One of them <ref> [7] </ref> attempts to explain and analyse size and generality of solutions in GP. In the experiments, the degree of overlapping between training instances and the testing instances is not explicitly controlled. This can create difficulties in making a direct comparison of training and testing performances.
