Abstract: Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation method for simultaneous amplitude, time delay, and data demodulation in direct sequence spread spectrum communication is proposed. The likelihood function is analytically intractable, so we consider a recursive estimation algorithm. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm has found increasing use in similar problems, however, for this case it is analytically intractable. Recently, a variant of the EM algorithm, called Space Alternating Generalized EM (SAGE), has been derived. In this work we apply the SAGE algorithm to the sequence estimation problem in a way which allows for simple sequential updates of the parameters. The resulting algorithm maximizes the penalized likelihood function, where the penalty is chosen to ensure good synchronization performance. Simulation results show that the algorithm has fast convergence, and essentially achieves optimal performance.

Reference-contexts: However, by formulating the problem in terms of a penalized version of the parameters it is possible to decouple the parameters and update them sequentially using the recently developed SAGE algorithm [6]. Application of the EM algorithm to a similar problem has also been considered in <ref> [3] </ref>, however this method cannot be easily extended to the DS-SS problem, because it requires initial coarse synchronization so that the received signal can be match filtered by a locally generated replica of the spreading sequence. <p> Direct solution of the ML equation above is analytically intractable except in very special cases. This has sparked interest in finding recursive approximations to the ML estimator. Recently an EM algorithm for the recursive solution of a similar base-band signaling problem has been proposed <ref> [3] </ref>. This algorithm is based on sampling the outputs of a matched filter at the receiver clock timing. Generally these samples are not a sufficient statistic, therefore this method is sub-optimal.

Reference-contexts: To solve this problem, we propose an ML estimation technique based on the EM algorithm, which iterates on the parameter updates in a manner which guarantees an increase of the likelihood function. The classical EM algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> requires simultaneous parameter updates and does not yield a computationally efficient procedure. However, by formulating the problem in terms of a penalized version of the parameters it is possible to decouple the parameters and update them sequentially using the recently developed SAGE algorithm [6].

Reference-contexts: In Section 4 simulation results are reported. Finally, in Section 5, some conclusions of this work are presented. 2. SYSTEM MODEL We now introduce a single user model of the DS-SS communication system. This problem cannot be efficiently solved by an EM algorithm such as the one proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>, due to the inherent coupling between the parameters of the model. Later, this model will be modified so that the EM methodology can be applied using the SAGE algorithm. The system model defined below is very common in spread spectrum radio communication systems.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, the approach was to estimate each parameter by a specialized circuit or algorithm, such as a phase locked loop for phase estimation, and delay locked loop for time delay estimation <ref> [7] </ref>. However, this approach is costly in terms of transmission capacity, because it requires transmission of a training sequence in order to give the receiver sufficient time to synchronize. <p> Multiple bit correlator gives amplitude estimate a i+1 . 4. NUMERICAL RESULTS A single user noncoherent asynchronous receiver based on the model described above was simulated on a computer. The direct sequences were maximal length sequences <ref> [7] </ref>. The amplitude, time delay, and data bits were kept fixed in each simulation. We observed that a good initial time delay estimate is crucial for finding the global maximum. Therefore, ML time delay estimates were found in each bit interval, and then averaged over all intervals.
