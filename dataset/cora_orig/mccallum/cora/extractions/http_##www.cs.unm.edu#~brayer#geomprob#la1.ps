Title: 1 Why Study Linear Algebra? 1. Vectors and matrices are a convenient notation for representing

Abstract: We begin the introduction to Linear Algebra with basic definitions of matrices and their operations and then vectors and their operations. In these definitions, we stress the abstract algebraic aspects for 2 reasons. First, we wish to acquaint the student with the study of abstract algebraic objects because there are lots of CS applications and theory based on them. Second, we want to study the definitions in the abstract so that later we can stretch our understanding to completely new applications of vectors and matrices. We want to be able to recognize things in real life that are vectors even when they don't come with labels. After this basic introduction, we cover the traditional subject of simultaneous equations, but with an emphasis on a deep geometric understanding. We want a geometric understanding so we can "visualize" what is going on in higher dimensional spaces. We then cover Transformations, especially linear. And we finish with the study of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a linear transformation. In the latter material, we try to cover several applications of importance in Computer Science.
