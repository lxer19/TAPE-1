Title: Satisfiability Coding Lemma  
Author: Ramamohan Paturi Pavel Pudlak and Francis Zane 
Abstract: We present and analyze two simple algorithms for finding satisfying assignments of k-CNFs (Boolean formulae in conjunctive normal form with at most k literals per clause). The first is a randomized algorithm which, with probability approaching 1, finds a satisfying assignment of a satisfiable k-CNF formula F in time O(n 2 jF j2 nn=k ). The second algorithm is deterministic, and its running time approaches 2 nn=2k for large n and k. The randomized algorithm is the best known algorithm for k &gt; 3; the deterministic algorithm is the best known deterministic algorithm for k &gt; 4. We also show an (n 1=4 2 n ) lower bound on the size of depth 3 circuits of AND and OR gates computing the parity function. This bound is tight up to a constant factor. The key idea used in these upper and lower bounds is what we call the Satis-fiability Coding Lemma. This basic lemma shows how to encode satisfying solutions of a k-CNF succinctly.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of finding a satisfying assignment of a Boolean formula in k-CNF (conjunctive normal form with at most k literals per clause) has been long studied, and the corresponding decision problem for k 3 was one of the first problems shown to be NP-complete <ref> [2, 5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There has been considerable progress in the study of the computational limitations of polynomial size and bounded depth circuits of unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates (AC 0 ). The techniques <ref> [3, 8, 12] </ref> used for showing lower bounds on the size of bounded depth circuits establish that functions computed by such small size circuits have some useful (for lower bounds) property. <p> However, such useful techniques still have not resulted in the determination of the exact complexity of computing the parity function. More specifically, in the case of depth3 circuits, the best known general technique (the Switching Lemma <ref> [3] </ref>) yields a lower bound of (2 c p n ) for c &lt; 1=8. Hastad, Jukna and Pudlak [4] improved this lower bound to (2 0:618 p n ) by using a top-down argument.

Reference-contexts: A straightforward improvement is obtained by selecting a smallest length clause and branching on all but one of the assignments to the variables in that clause, omitting the one assignment that makes the clause false. Monien and Speckenmeyer <ref> [6] </ref> analyzed this algorithm carefully by arguing that such assignments either produce a clause of shorter length or are autark. An assignment to a set of variables is autark if all the clauses that contain the variables are satisfied by the assignment. <p> These results are summarized in the following table: Previous New New (det.)

Reference-contexts: Hastad's Switching Lemma implies an O (2 (1c=k)n ) bound (with c &lt; 1) on the number of isolated solutions of a kCNF. In fact, our Satisfiability Coding Lemma is inspired by Razborov's proof <ref> [9] </ref> of a variant of Hastad's Switching Lemma. Using the Satisfiability Coding Lemma, we prove that a k CNF can have at most 2 (11=k)n isolated solutions, which is in fact the best possible bound.

Reference-contexts: It seems likely that one can prove a stronger version of the Switching Lemma if one has good bounds on the number of other minterms. In an insightful remark, Valiant <ref> [13] </ref> commented that the pursuit to understand the reasons for the inherent computational difficulty of problems has two complementary facets, the positive one of finding fast algorithms and the negative one of proving lower bounds on the inherent complexity.
