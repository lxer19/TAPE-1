Title: FAST PARALLEL COMPUTATION OF REDUNDANCY  
Author: Daniel Boley 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Minnesota  
Abstract: For redundant manipulators, the inverse kinematics equations are typically solved by taking the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian, or by adding enough constraints to algebraically remove the redundancy. Many popular measures of redundancy also depend on computing the algebraic rank or determinant of the Jaco-bian. We present fast, parallelizable algorithms to dynamically update all the pseudo-inverse, determinant, rank, and many other redundancy measures and properties as the arm goes through its motions.

Reference-contexts: For the case of redundant robots, J will be nm rectangular with n&lt;m. It has already been noted that the QR decomposition can be used to solve (3) when full rank <ref> [1] </ref>. Here, we outline how the COD can be used to solve the problem when rank deficient. When J has full rank, the following prescription applies in the same way, except that we can replace the COD (9) with the QR decomposition (5).

Reference-contexts: For example, for a redundant manipulator, the kinematic mapping of joint angles to cartesian coordinates will have a non-square Jacobian with more columns than rows. One method to invert the kinematic mapping that has been suggested is the use of the generalized (Moore-Penrose) inverse (see, e.g. <ref> [3, p243] </ref>), computed explicitly. <p> One main purpose of this paper is to evaluate different methods to solve (4). COMPUTATIONAL MATRIX METHODS As noted in <ref> [3, p230f] </ref>, there are methods for solving a rectangular system of equations that are more accurate and faster than methods based on computing J # explicitly. <p> If A is a full rank matrix, then the QR Decomposition, also known as an orthogonal triangularization procedure, reduces A to upper triangular form by a series of orthogonal transformations such as Householder transformations: I-2uu T where u is a unit vector <ref> [3] </ref>. The result is the matrix factorization A = QR, where R is upper triangular and Q is the orthogonal matrix consisting of the accumulation of all the individual Householder transformations. <p> In the case that the matrix A is singular or rank deficient, then the QR factorization is not sufficient to solve the least squares problem. However, the QR factorization can be extended to include column pivoting at little extra cost <ref> [3, p235] </ref>. <p> It is then possible to solve the rank deficient least squares problem min c c Ax-bc c = c c QRP T x-bc c (7) by treating R 2 ~ ~ 0 and using the formula <ref> [3] </ref> x = P Q 0 -1 Q T b H By allowing P to be a general orthogonal matrix, we may further reduce (6) to the complete orthogonal decomposition (COD): - 3 - R Q 0 R 2 J R Q P 2 P 1 J ~ ~ Q 1 <p> Typical numerical experience indicates that the number of sweeps needed to converge is proportional to log n for an nn matrix. On an nn mesh of parallel processors, one can order the rotations so that an entire sweep can be completed in n-1 steps <ref> [3, p450] </ref>. At convergence, we have the relation JV = A () , where V is the accumulation of all the individual orthogonal transformations, and A () has mutually orthogonal columns. <p> In general, the cost associated with each method is heavily dominated by the computation of the associated factorization. The basic cost in floating point operations for each associated factorization is reported in Table 1 <ref> [3, p239, 248, 450] </ref>. The extra costs for using the factorization to solve the problem are much smaller. We present three typical situations: (i) a square, nonsingular, nonredundant system, (ii) a highly redundant but full rank system, and (iii) a nonredundant but singular system. <p> For the full rank situations (i) and (ii), the COD reduces to the QR decomposition. This table shows that the optimal method depends on the situation. For (i), any of the first three methods have comparable cost, though it is well known that the normal equations suffers in accuracy <ref> [3, p230] </ref>. For a highly redundant situation (ii), the normal equations is the cheapest, but if we are near a singularity, it tends to break down, so we must use the COD.
