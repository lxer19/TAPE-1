Abstract: We develop a calculus of line-of-sight relations, that is, the different qualitative relations in which one object in a person's visual field can be positioned relative to another. Examples of such relations are `partially hides' and `just hidden by'. We treat the system of such relations in a way that is analogous to the treatment of temporal intervals by (Allen 1984) and (Freksa 1992a), and of spatial regions by (Randell, Cui & Cohn 1992). We give the conceptual neighbourhood diagram for line-of-sight relations and show how to generate the composition table from the composition tables for two independent simpler relations whose direct product gives rise to the complete set of line-of-sight relations. The line-of-sight calculus is presented as a testing ground for qualitative reasoning techniques developed in the temporal and spatial domains, and is also proposed as having potential application One way of describing the relative positions of objects is an observer-centred one: that is, we describe how the objects' positions look from a particular viewpoint. In the absence of depth cues, the three-dimensional scene appears as if it were laid out on the surface of a sphere centred on the observer (or in practice a hemisphere above the ground as diameter plane). The clearest case of this is the night sky, in which the real distance of the sun, moon, stars and planets is not manifest to the ordinary observer. Depth cues in ordinary vision are provided by binocular parallax, by occlusion, by atmospheric effects, and by knowledge of the real size of objects in the field of view. In what follows we shall concentrate solely on occlusion. Consider two convex objects A and B freely moving within the field of view of an observer. We can distinguish the following 14 qualitatively distinct configurations, called line-of-sight relations: to the field of computer vision.
