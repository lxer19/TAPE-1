Abstract: How do my mental states compare to yours? We suggest that, while we may not be able to compare experiences, we can compare neural representations, and that the correct way to compare neural representations is through analysis of the distances between them. In this paper, we present a technique for measuring the similarities between representations at various layers of neural networks. We then use the measure to demonstrate empirically that different artificial neural networks trained by backpropagation on the same categorization task, even with different representational encodings of the input patterns and different numbers of hidden units, reach states in which representations at the hidden units are similar.

Reference-contexts: For inputs, we used a database of spectrophotometer readings from color samples <ref> (anonymous, 1995) </ref>. The original data were 61-element vectors of integers between 0 and 4095, read at 5nm intervals of the visual spectrum between 400nm and 700nm.

Reference-contexts: Others have extracted cooccurrence matrices with semantic properties from large text corpora (Lund et al., 1995). Paul Churchland has argued that the activation state space of neural networks captures semantic similarity by the proximity of activation vectors <ref> (Churchland, 1989) </ref>. This view has much to be said for it.

Reference-contexts: Calling Churchland's view state-space semantics, however, Jerry Fodor and Ernest Lepore have mounted a powerful argument against it <ref> (Fodor and Lepore, 1992) </ref>. They argue that state-space semantics entails semantic holism, and that semantic holism is intolerable. <p> See <ref> (Fodor and Lepore, 1992, pp. 8-16) </ref> for the details of their arguments. <p> We are thus faced with the question of when x and y are the same semantic dimensions....But this is surely just the old semantic identity problem back again <ref> (Fodor and Lepore, 1992, pp. 197 8) </ref>. Putting the argument explicitly in terms of neural networks, it goes like this: suppose you have two networks, possibly with different numbers of nodes (i.e., different dimensionality of the activation space) and differently-weighted connections (i.e., different dimensions in the activation space).

Reference-contexts: Some use techniques from psychophysics, performing multidimensional scaling on large numbers of human similarity judgements (Rips et al., 1973). Others have extracted cooccurrence matrices with semantic properties from large text corpora <ref> (Lund et al., 1995) </ref>. Paul Churchland has argued that the activation state space of neural networks captures semantic similarity by the proximity of activation vectors (Churchland, 1989).

Reference-contexts: Introduction Many psychologists have postulated models of semantic memory that identify semantic similarity with proximity in a high-dimensional space of concepts. Some use techniques from psychophysics, performing multidimensional scaling on large numbers of human similarity judgements <ref> (Rips et al., 1973) </ref>. Others have extracted cooccurrence matrices with semantic properties from large text corpora (Lund et al., 1995).

Reference-contexts: For example, hard-`c' and `k' sounds were grouped together, and at the highest level, consonants were grouped together, as were vowels. <ref> (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987) </ref>. Given two networks, then, one could do cluster analyses of the same inputs to each and compare the resulting dendograms.
