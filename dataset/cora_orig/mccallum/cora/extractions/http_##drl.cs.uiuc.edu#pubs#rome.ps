Title: The Importance of Declarative Semantics for MLS Relational Databases  
Author: Kenneth Smith and Marianne Winslett

Abstract: A database semantics assigns a meaning to database instances in terms of the world being modeled by the database. The semantics of current MLS relational database systems are usually not explicitly stated, corresponding to the operational semantics approach. Different MLS relational systems appear to be using different semantics, however, as evidenced by disparate approaches issues such as labeling strategies, multivalued attributes, and null values. It is therefore vital that an explicit declarative semantics approach be taken in the future, to facilitate the discussion, comparison, and evaluation necessary to many current and future directions of MLS research. We discuss efforts in this direction, and present here a belief-based semantics suited to this end because of its generality. We describe its extensions, both completed and planned, and outline a research agenda for establishing a common semantic understanding.

Reference-contexts: A declarative semantics uses a formalism to express the meaning of general database constructs, making it possible to infer the meaning of particular database instances by application of the semantics. Work on a declarative semantics for MLS relational databases has recently begun. In <ref> [1] </ref> Xiaolei Qian uses normalization theory to develop a semantics which compares security labeling strategies (tuple and attribute). Her theory is sufficient to compare and evaluate the disparate set of proposed polyinstantiation integrity properties.

Reference-contexts: In [1] Xiaolei Qian uses normalization theory to develop a semantics which compares security labeling strategies (tuple and attribute). Her theory is sufficient to compare and evaluate the disparate set of proposed polyinstantiation integrity properties. We introduced in <ref> [2] </ref> a belief-based semantics for MLS relational databases which is quite general, yet captures an important range of meanings for MLS databases. This semantics utilizes simple concepts from logic (Kripke structures). <p> If two systems can be described in terms of a single semantics, their syntactic constructs, integrity constraints, and operations can be readily compared. * It can serve as a means for evaluation. Many existing systems are both syntactically and semantically ambiguous <ref> [2] </ref>. With semantic underpinnings, these ambiguities should become obvious and additional integrity constraints can be posed which will prevent anomalous syntactic constructs. 4 * It can serve as a means for federation of heterogeneous MLS databases, negotiation between autonomous systems, informing users of local semantics, etc.

Reference-contexts: As shown in this example, this semantics tells us how to interpret an instance of polyinstantiation (not just how to control it) and what an approach to security labeling means. We have extended this semantics to support ER modeling and an active production rule system <ref> [3] </ref>, and have defined a set of relational operators as well.

Reference-contexts: We have extended this semantics to support ER modeling and an active production rule system [3], and have defined a set of relational operators as well. Additionally, we have studied a mapping from our semantics to a system with attribute security labels <ref> [4] </ref>, and our semantic conclusions on polyinstantiation (MLS entities) coincide with independently derived conclusions (tuple and attribute polyinstantiation) by researchers using a very different system (Seaview) [5]. This semantics is also being extended with the incorporation of cross level joins, an investigation of the automated inheritance of lower level beliefs.

Reference-contexts: This semantics is also being extended with the incorporation of cross level joins, an investigation of the automated inheritance of lower level beliefs. Although general, this semantics can be specialized with constraints for situations not requiring its full generality. As an example of such a constraint, in <ref> [6] </ref> only two beliefs are permitted about the value of an attribute across all security levels, instead of one per level as in our semantics. 3 Research Agenda Currently, a number of MLS relational models exist with a wide variance in vocabulary, syntax, and usually ambiguous and unspecified semantics.
