Abstract: MIT Media Laboratory, Perceptual Computing Technical Report #242 Abstract We describe a system for semiautomatically extracting 3-D object models from raw, uncalibrated video. The system utilizes a recursive estimator to accurately recover camera motion, pointwise structure, and camera focal length. Recovered 3-D points are used to compute a piecewise-smooth surface model for the object. Recovered motion and camera geometry are then used along with the original video to texture map the surfaces. We describe extensions to our previously-reported geometry estimation formulation [2] that incorporate focal length estimation and other improvements, so that accurate estimates of structure and camera motion can be recovered from uncalibrated video cameras. We also discuss the buildup of texture maps from sequences of images, which is important in producing realistic-looking models. Since the computations parallel those used in computer graphics, efficient hardware already exists for doing this part of the modeling.

It is critical for estimation stability to use such a minimal parameterization. To see this, consider the number of degrees of freedom of these structure from motion representations versus the number of available measurements at each frame when N points are tracked. <p> This corresponds to the magnitude of the translational motion. It is equally acceptable to fix any other single length associated with the motion or the structure. In many previous formulations, including <ref> [3; 12] </ref> some component of the translational motion is fixed at a finite value. This is not a good idea for two reasons. First, if the fixed component, e.g. the magnitude of translation is actually zero, the estimation becomes numerically ill-conditioned. <p> The vector x is the state vector used in an EKF implementation, where the measurement vector contains the image locations of features in each new frame. The EKF is considered a common tool now in computer vision and is described in detail in <ref> [3; 6; 9] </ref>, thus will not be discussed here. Instead, we turn attention to the issue of biased noise and how it relates to various representations of object structure. <p> In our SfM problem, augmenting the state vector to account for bias adds two additional parameters per feature. This results in a geometry representation having a total of 7+3N parameters. This is the same number as if one simply used three free spatial parameters for each point, as in <ref> [3; 12] </ref>. The two interpretations of the problem are clearly related. In the case of biased noise, Equation 3 can be written Y ! (1 + fffi)(u + b u ) (1 + fffi)(v + b v ) ff (9) where (b u ; b v ) represent the bias.
