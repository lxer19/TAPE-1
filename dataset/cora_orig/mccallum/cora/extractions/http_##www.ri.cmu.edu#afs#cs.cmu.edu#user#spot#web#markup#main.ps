Abstract: on the side of nationalism are ranged all the powers of poetry and song, language and literature, self-love and pride; in its service are gathered the strongest emotions, worthy as well as base; loyalty and love as well as lust and hate. on the other side we have only the cold light of the human intelligence, warmed by the small fire of complete unselfishness. but on this side is truth, and on this side is God, and either it will prevail or we shall go down into utter darkness. (So says Kenneth Boulding, as quoted by Robert Wright in Three Scientists and Their Gods)
