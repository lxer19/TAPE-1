Reference-contexts: I then show experimental results for the Wigner distribution of several discrete-time signals. I conclude with a discussion of the relative importance of the non-linear effects of the Wigner distribution. 2 Time-Frequency Techniques In his review of time-frequency distributions <ref> [Coh89] </ref>, Leon Cohen gives the expression for the general class of distributions P (t; !) = 4 2 s u + 2 s fl u 2 (; t )e jtjt!+ju dudt d (1) A definition of the discrete Wigner distribution which is consistent with the continuous distribution is given in [PP86].

Both the exponential distribution of Choi and Williams <ref> [CW89] </ref> and the cone-shaped distribution of Zhao, Atlas and Marks [ZAM90] claim to reduce the cross-terms that plague the Wigner distribution. Choi and Williams show that by using the exponential kernel function given in Equation 13, the cross-terms can be reduced by adjusting .
