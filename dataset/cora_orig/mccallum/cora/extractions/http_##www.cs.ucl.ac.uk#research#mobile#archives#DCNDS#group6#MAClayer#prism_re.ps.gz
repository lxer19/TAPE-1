With the allocation of the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands for unlicensed use in 1985, came great enthusiasm for commercial use of WLAN products in these bands [2]. By 1990, the first ISM band WLAN products came out on the market [3].

Reference-contexts: With the allocation of the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands for unlicensed use in 1985, came great enthusiasm for commercial use of WLAN products in these bands <ref> [2] </ref>. By 1990, the first ISM band WLAN products came out on the market [3]. Soon after, the IEEE 802.11 committee was formed and began work on a standard for high speed WLANs. <p> The device used is a product of the Comlinear Company <ref> [2] </ref>. In the remainder of this paper, the ACT PTF will be referred to as the channel simulator, or ACT device. <p> There are also three useful bandpass kernel files there called KER10MHZ.DAT, KER20MHZ.DAT, KER30MHZ.DAT. These can be used to test the ACT device, or to simulate the system using a clean channel. For more information on the ACT device, and it's applications, see [12] and <ref> [2] </ref>. 6.3 Running the System In this section, several different tests will be described to give a better understanding of how the system works. The first section will discuss how to run the baseband processor evaluation board independently of the other boards of the system.

The 2.4GHz ISM band was chosen for a worldwide WLAN RF standard by the 802.11 committee because it was globally available. <p> The development of the standard began in 1990, when the IEEE 802.11 WLAN committee was formed <ref> [3] </ref>. Their goal was to create a standard for WLAN which would allow high data rates 1 as well as interoperabilty among different WLAN products operating in the same medium. The fifth draft of the 802.11 standard has recently been accepted bringing 802.11 close to completion.

Gupta, </author> <title> "Performance of asynchronous data transfer methods of IEEE 802.11 MAC protocal," </title> <journal> IEEE Personal Communications, </journal> <volume> vol. 3, </volume> <editor> p. </editor> <volume> 8, </volume> <month> October </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: The MAC specification of 802.11 provides asynchronous, time-bounded and contention free access through different physical layers. The MAC is implemented using a Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol <ref> [4] </ref>. The PHY layer provides access through either an infrared or RF medium. Finally, the MAC-PHY sublayers define the structure of 802.11 packets [5]. The 802.11 standard specifies three physical layer transmission methods: Diffused Infrared (DFIR), Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). <p> Connections between different BSS's or to a wired network are accomplished by using an Access Point (AP). The CF which allows BSS communications is implemented in the physical layer of the network. It utilizes a physical property of the medium to separate different BSS's from one another <ref> [4] </ref>. In the DSSS specification, the CF is implemented by breaking up the 2.4GHz transmission band into 11 channels 2 , each with a unique center frequency [5]. For transmission in any channel the 11 bit Barker sequence has been specified.

The 802.11 standard specifies three physical layer transmission methods: Diffused Infrared (DFIR), Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). DFIR is mainly specified for indoor use, and has the shortest range. DSSS and FHSS are both specified for RF transmission in the 2.4GHz ISM band. <p> It utilizes a physical property of the medium to separate different BSS's from one another [4].

For transmission in any channel the 11 bit Barker sequence has been specified. This means that all stations use the same spreading sequence but are split up into BSS's through the use of different channel frequencies.

Reference-contexts: The charge injection is controlled by the RF input of the device. The taps are all weighted, and summed together. The sum is fed to the output port <ref> [6] </ref>. The resulting circuits functionality is shown in Figure 10. Due to the characteristics of the device, it has a programmable transfer function, which allows it to be used to simulate a channel.

Reference-contexts: This software package simulates the multipath effect in a building by using a two dimensional ray tracing algorithm. With information on the floorplan, frequencies, locations or the source and receiver, the software will calculate the impulse response of the channel. Detailed information on XRAY can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. The XRAY software was later modified to generate the information needed to program the ACT device. The impulse response is automatically convolved with a kernel, sampled, quantized, and converted into a file which can be loaded into the channel simulator. <p> The last piece of major hardware that we had to study was the ACT channel simulator. This is the device which was used as our real-time RF channel simulator. The software for the ACT device that includes a 2D Ray Tracing program <ref> [7] </ref> and a graphical user interface designed at CWINS had to be studied. We learned how the ray tracing software can be used to simulate the RF propogation in real time. Various RF monitoring equipment also had to be used and understood.

Reference-contexts: The timing diagram of Figure 22 shows what condition the signals need to be in order to initiate the write cycle of the TX board. All of these signals are from the computer's ISA bus, and greater detailed information is given in "ISA System Architecture" <ref> [8] </ref> and in Appendix B. Figures 23 and 24 readily show the TX logic for the TX data output port. Combinational logic is used to decode the address lines of the data bus, and the result of this logic is fed into a flip-flop (given in Figure 23.

Reference-contexts: This is done by reading memory address A0002, and can be done with the simple assembly instructions given below. Reading the data contained in A0002 also clears the interrupt signal. Further information about these instructions can be found in "Assembly Language for the IBM-PC" <ref> [9] </ref>. * mov dx, A000 sets the data segment to A000 * mov di, 2 sets the data instruction pointer to 2 * mov ax, [di] moves the contents of A0002 into ax (the accumulator) The data received when memory address A0002 is read is set up as shown in Figure

More information about state machines can be found in "Digital Design: Principles & Practices" <ref> [10] </ref>. 4.3 ISA - FIFO Interface 39 An important component involved in retrieving the flags onto the data bus is the tri-state gates which are shown on Figure 31. The tri-state gates are controlled by a signal called EN_INT_BAR generated by the Altera chip.

Reference-contexts: One of them is an SMA package part, and the other is a PC board mounting mixer. The PC board mixer has been put into a metal enclosure with SMA connectors to simplify connections. More information on the Mini-Circuits mixers can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. One potential source of problems is that one of the mixers requires a LO level of 7dBm, while the other mixer requires a 13dBm LO. For our setup, both mixers are simply run off of one LO with a power splitter.

The performance of this simulation system has been investigated in <ref> [12] </ref> by comparing a transmission through the channel simulator with a simulated room to transmissions in the actual room. The results obtained showed the simulated channel had similar characteristics to the actual RF channel. However, these tests were simple and did not involve the transmission of data.
