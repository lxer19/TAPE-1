Title: Theoretical Foundations of Association Rules

Abstract: In this paper we describe a formal framework for the problem of mining association rules. The theoretical foundation is based on the field of formal concept analysis. A concept is composed of closed subsets of attributes (itemsets) and objects (transactions). We show that all frequent itemsets are uniquely determined by the frequent concepts. We further show how this lattice-theoretic framework can be used to find a small rule generating set, from which one can infer all other association rules.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Association rule discovery, a successful and important mining task, aims at uncovering all frequent patterns among sets (or transactions) composed of data attributes. Most of the current work has focused on developing efficient algorithms <ref> [2, 3, 4, 15, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 29] </ref>. On the other hand, there has been little work in formulating a theory of associations. Such a theory can help in estimating the complexity of the mining task, and also in developing a unified framework for common data mining problems. <p> Section 4 casts association mining as a search for frequent concepts, and Section 5 looks at the problem of generating rule bases. We discuss related work in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7. 2 Association Rules: Problem Formulation The association mining task, introduced in <ref> [2] </ref>, can be stated as follows: Let A be a set of items, and T a database of transactions, where each transaction has a unique identifier (tid) and contains a set of items. A set of items is also called an itemset. <p> This observation can possibly aid the development of efficient algorithms since we need to enumerate only the closed frequent itemsets, instead of enumerating all frequent itemsets like most current algorithms. 4 5 Rule Generation Association rules were originally proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. However, we will show below that association rules are exactly the partial implications, satisfying support and confidence constraints, proposed in an earlier paper [21]. Let (G; M; I) be a context. <p> It can be easily verified that all the association rules shown in Figure 1b can be derived from this set. 6 Related Work There has been an astonishing amount of research in developing efficient algorithms for mining frequent itemsets <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 29] </ref>.

We then place association rule mining within the lattice-theoretic framework of formal concept analysis introduced by Wille <ref> [28] </ref>. Given a binary relation, a concept consists of an extent (transactions) and an intent (attributes), such that all objects in the extent share the attributes in the intent, and vice versa. We show that all frequent itemsets are uniquely determined by the set of frequent concepts. <p> complexity, it remains to be seen if this algorithm is practical for large databases with millions of transactions. 4 Itemset Discovery: Formal Concept Analysis In this section we will show that association mining is very closely related to formal concept analysis, which was introduced in a seminal paper by Wille <ref> [28] </ref>. We assume that the reader is familiar with basic concepts of lattice theory (see [7] for a good introduction). 3 Definition 3 Let S be a set.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Association rule discovery, a successful and important mining task, aims at uncovering all frequent patterns among sets (or transactions) composed of data attributes. Most of the current work has focused on developing efficient algorithms <ref> [2, 3, 4, 15, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 29] </ref>. On the other hand, there has been little work in formulating a theory of associations. Such a theory can help in estimating the complexity of the mining task, and also in developing a unified framework for common data mining problems. <p> It can be easily verified that all the association rules shown in Figure 1b can be derived from this set. 6 Related Work There has been an astonishing amount of research in developing efficient algorithms for mining frequent itemsets <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 29] </ref>. In [14, 13], the connection between associations and hypergraph transversals was made. They also presented a model of association mining as the discovery of maximal elements of theories, and gave some complexity bounds.
