Title: Beyond Islands: Runs in Clone-Probe Matrices (extended abstract)  
Author: David B. Wilson David S. Greenberg Cynthia A. Phillips 
Abstract: Physical mapping is a fundamental component of the human genome project. A physical map consists of a set of probes which mark unique positions on a long fragment of DNA, together with the relative order of the probes on the DNA. This order is inferred from clone-probe hybridization experiments, which determine the probes contained within various fragments of the genome. In practice, the order of the probes is not completely determined by the hybridization experiments. To better design these experiments, researchers have analyzed the expected distribution of islands groups of probes which are known to be near one another that would result from hybridization experiments with different numbers of clones and probes. In this paper we analyze the distribution of runs groups of probes whose relative order is completely determined by the hybridization experiment. We include analytic, numerical, Monte Carlo, and simulation results on runs, which can further assist in the design of these experiments.

Reference-contexts: But if an experimentalist hopes to learn something from an experiment, then the experiment must yield good information in the errorfree setting. The cost of generating a hybridiation matrix is an elusive quantity. One might think the cost is the size of the matrix, but clones can be pooled <ref> [6] </ref> and tested simultaneously. If no clone in the pool hybridizes with a probe, then all associated entries are 0. Two 1's must be tested separately for verification in any pooling strategy, so the number of 1's is a lower bound on the number of hybridizations.

Reference-contexts: Generically, the physical mapping process starts with a set of overlapping clones (the clone library) and experimental data from which information about clone overlaps can be derived, fingerprints. In this paper we consider fingerprints resulting from hybridization with sequence-tagged sites (STS) <ref> [14] </ref>. Each STS (or probe) is assumed to map to an unknown yet unique site on the genome. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) [20] can determine (with some error) if a given probe is contained in a given clone. Overlap of clones is thus witnessed by two clones sharing a probe.

Therefore, the biological community has invested considerably in analysis of clone-probe matrices, both in interpreting the P Q-tree to determine useful properties of the probe ordering <ref> [15] </ref>, and in designing hybridization experiments to maximize the information they reveal.

A framework for experimental comparison of these algorithms is proposed in <ref> [15] </ref> but it leaves open the question of what measure to use as determining the quality of the algorithm. <p> Consider the P Q-tree associated with a given C1P matrix. As noted in <ref> [15] </ref>, the information contained in the matrix is related to the Q-ness of the tree. To quantify this information, one might look for a large independent set of Q-nodes, i.e. a set of Q-nodes such that none is an ancestor of another. <p> For example, a sizable fraction of the clones can be chimeric, meaning they represent two or more consecutive pieces of the genome. These clones have two or more blocks of ones when the matrix is in true probe order. Greenberg and Istrail <ref> [15] </ref> show that variations corresponding to actual genomic studies (chimerism, deletion, false positives and negatives) inevitably have much greater ambiguity than the errorfree case. But if an experimentalist hopes to learn something from an experiment, then the experiment must yield good information in the errorfree setting.

Since one way of producing probes is to replicate the end of a clone [23], one could start with a collection of clones (distributed according to the Arratia et al. model), and use only probes that come from the endpoints of clones. They found that the end-point method increased coverage and required fewer probes than random probes.

Reference-contexts: If we only place edges between clones that share a probe, then the connected components are called apparent islands. Lander and Water-man [17] pioneered the field by considering a model in which clones occur according to a Poisson process (see <ref> [24] </ref> for a definition). While a chromosome has finite length, it is much longer than the clones, so they modeled the chromosome with the real line, with clones being intervals of length 1. <p> The exponential clone distribution results when the chromosome is cut at random points uniformly along its length, and a small fraction of the cut pieces get incorporated into vectors. We call the latter clone distribution (Poisson start positions, exponential length) the Arratia et al. distribution. See <ref> [24] </ref> for more information on the relationship between the Poisson and exponential distributions. Since chimeric clones may yield false linkages, they extend the definition of apparent island to allow only clones which share at least k probes to be considering overlapping.

Reference-contexts: This distilled matrix contains stronger ordering information particularly when one is searching for large subsets of probes with good ordering. 2.1 Islands Work to date on statistical analysis of ambiguity in physical maps (at the matrix level) has concentrated on characterizing islands or contigs (e.g. <ref> [3, 5, 12, 17, 23, 25, 26] </ref>). Consider the following overlap/interval graph G = (V; E): V = fv i ji = 1 : : : ng where vertex v i represents clone i. <p> Setting = 1 gives the distribution of true islands. Several papers have extended this original work <ref> [3, 4, 5, 12, 25] </ref>. Arratia et al. include randomly occuring probes and allow the clones to have mean length 1 rather than constant length 1.

Zhang and Marr <ref> [26] </ref> later developed a theoretical analysis of the properties of islands in the double-endpoint strategy introduced by Palazzolo et al. 2.2 Runs While islands are a biologically important measure, the partition of the genome into islands does not tell the whole story. <p> One way involves generating probes from a soup of clones. One can generate many probes at once this way, but there is no way to tell from which clone a probe was generated. Another method generates endpoints from a single clone <ref> [26] </ref>, so we know from which clone a given probe was derived. The latter case gives more information, since clones are no longer simply defined as sets of probes which hit them.

Reference-contexts: The elegant structure of Booth and Lueker's algorithm is completely lost when any errors occur. In fact the resulting problem becomes ill-posed: a C1P ordering is no longer possible and it is not clear what to substitute. In <ref> [1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 27] </ref> various generalizations are considered and all are shown (or believed) to be NP-complete [13]. Thus there have been a wide variety of heuristic and approximate algorithms suggested.
