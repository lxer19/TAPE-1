Reference-contexts: This is the most difficult of the four problems posed so far, and requires a systematic approach to the geometry. An interested reader can find solutions to these problems in <ref> [4, 1] </ref>. 15 4.2.2 Laboratory In the laboratory session, the students use the concepts and formulas they have learned in order to program a manipulator that grasps a pen to draw a given figure.

Reference-contexts: Hence, it is equipped to serve as a controller for a wide variety of plants with little or no additional equipment. The students are allowed to experiment with controllers for an existing experimental set-up, the three fingered Modular Dextrous Hand <ref> [5] </ref> (see Figure 6), without having to machine fixtures, build sensors or design computer interfaces.

Reference-contexts: A 10-turn potentiometer is used to sense the position of the motor and the 6.270 board <ref> [7] </ref> developed at MIT is used to implement the controller. The 6.270 is a microcontroller board which is used in MIT's annual 6.270 Lego Robotics Design Competition and contains, among other things, A/D inputs and outputs designed to drive a DC motor. <p> The mechanical components were constructed using the parts from a Lego building kit. The electrical and computer components were implemented using the 6.270 board. This project is motivated by MIT's annual Lego Robotics Design Competition <ref> [7] </ref>. The students were broken into two groups. One group was responsible for designing and constructing the mechanical parts of the robot. The other group was responsible for the electronic interfacing and the programming of the 6.270 board. The two groups spent approximately 15 minutes each day coordinating their work.

Reference-contexts: The students also discover that the complexity of the inverse kinematics problems grows quickly as the number of joints and number of DOFs increases. * Planar Parallel Manipulator Inverse Kinematics. The parallel planar manipulator is based on the design of the Stewart Platform <ref> [8] </ref>. For this manipulator, the link lengths are adjusted (usually by linear actuators) to achieve the desired configuration. Thus, the inverse kinematics problem is to find the required link lengths (L 1 ; L 2 ; L 3 ) for a given desired position and orientation (x; y; ).
