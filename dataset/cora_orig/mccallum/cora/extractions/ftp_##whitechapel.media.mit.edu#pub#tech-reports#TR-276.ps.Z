Abstract: M.I.T. Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Technical Report No. 276 January 1994 Abstract This paper presents a framework for analyzing the shape deformation of structures within the human brain. A mathematical model is developed describing the deformation of any brain structure whose shape is affected by both gross and detailed physical processes. By using the equivalence of physically-based and probability-based formulations of deformation, the total shape deformation is decomposed into physical modes of variation obtained from finite element analysis, and experimental modes of variation obtained from sample data using principal component analysis. This mathematical model is used to classify diseases that affect the shape of the ventricular system of the brain. Because ventricular shape is affected not only by pathology but also by overall brain shape, disease discrimination is difficult. By modeling the brain's elastic properties, we are able to compensate for some of the nonpathological modes of ventricular shape variation. This allows us to experimentally characterize modes of variation that are indicative of disease processes. Our technique is applied to magnetic resonance images of the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and normal-pressure hydrocephalus, as well as to healthy volunteers. Classification results are presented.

Reference-contexts: Pentland and Sclaroff [2] employed a much smaller number of degrees of freedom, representing shape in terms of an object's physical deformation modes. Instead of using the modes of a particular object, Bookstein <ref> [3] </ref> described shape deformation in terms of the physical deformation modes of an infinite thin plate, applying it primarily to the biological domain. Collins et al. [4] used this thin plate model to calculate brain deformation.

This deformation was then applied to internal structures of a predefined anatomical atlas in order to improve segmentation. Instead of physically modeling the structure under study, researchers have also sought to approximate the modes of variation through experimental observation.

Our method differs from the above work in the following respects. First, all of the above techniques use either physical modeling or experimental observation in order to represent shape deformation.

Reference-contexts: Aside from the unattractiveness of introducing user intervention, we have found that it is very difficult even for medical experts to reliably pick homologous points on different realizations of a complex structure. A more promising approach is to automatically detect these points or lines using concepts from differential geometry <ref> [18] </ref>. 8 Summary We have presented a new method that describes shape deformation by using both physical modeling and statistical techniques.
