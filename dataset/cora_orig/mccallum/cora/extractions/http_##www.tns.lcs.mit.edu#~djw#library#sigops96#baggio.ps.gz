Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Mobile environments have particular characteristics (hardware, communication media, etc.) that differ significantly from fixed network architectures <ref> [Forman 94] </ref>. They require techniques to ensure a complete independence of movement (disconnectability, location independence, resource discovery in newly visited networks, and some degree of execution transparency).

Reference-contexts: Basic referencing technique To access objects stored on mobile and fixed hosts we need a remote referencing mechanism; in this work we are using Stub-Scion Pair Chains (SSP Chains) <ref> [Shapiro 92] </ref>. The main goal of SSP Chains is to provide transparent referencing of remote objects in a distributed system, as a way to resolve the classical problem of object designation between remote hosts. corresponds to a process, so we can have several SSP Chain spaces on the same host). <p> pointers &B B A A Space 1 Space 4Space 3Space 2 Space 1 Space 4Space 3Space 2 Space 1 Space 4Space 3Space 2 Migration of B Exportation of &B &B B Space 1 Space 4Space 3Space 2 Short-cut reference of B SSP Chains support chain extension and their subsequent short-cutting <ref> [Shapiro 92] </ref> (Figure 2). Extension corresponds to adding stub (s) or scion (s) to either end of a chain. It is achieved by migration of an object or by exporting a reference to another space (from a support station to a mobile host, for example).
