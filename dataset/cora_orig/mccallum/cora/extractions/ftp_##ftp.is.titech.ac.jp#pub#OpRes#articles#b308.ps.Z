Abstract: Research Reports on Mathematical and Computing Sciences Series B : Operations Research Abstract. The SDPA (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm) is a software package for solving semidefinite program (SDP). It is based on a Mehrotra-type predictor-corrector infeasible primal-dual interior-point method. The SDPA handles the standard form SDP and its dual. It is implemented in C++ language utilizing the Meschach [9] for matrix computation. The SDPA incorporates dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. So, the maximum size of an SDP to be solved depends on the size of computational memory which user's computer loads. The SDPA version 4.10 enjoys the following features:
