Abstract: A simplified lossless model of the Raibert planar hopper is introduced for the purpose of analytically studying the control of forward velocity. A closed-form return map describing the robot's state at the next hop as a function of that at the current hop is derived. The Raibert forward velocity controller is introduced and the fixed points of the closed loop system are characterized as well as the stability of these points. A new control law inspired by this analysis is introduced and compared with the Raibert control law.

Reference-contexts: Previous work has endeavored to understand the control of vertical hopping height [3] [8] [7] and how it is influenced by the addition of the forward running dynamics <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper, we restrict attention to the control of forward velocity. Specifically, this is accomplished by deriving a return map for a simplifed version of the Raibert planar hopper, wherein we assume no energy losses and constant angular momentum during stance. <p> As is often the case for nonlinear differential equations, the stance dynamics shown above ( 1) do not admit closed form integration. Difficulties arise due to the presence of the gravitational terms and the choice of the spring law. Thus, as in <ref> [4] </ref> we will assume that the spring force is the dominant radial force during stance and that the robot's angular momentum is constant during stance. This allows us to ignore gravity in both the the radial and angular equations of stance motion.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper concerns the behavior of a planar hopping robot where the only control exerted is the placement of the leg at touchdown. This work is motivated by the dramatic success achieved by Marc Raibert in implementing simple control strategies to control physical hopping robots <ref> [5] </ref>. Raibert and his students built and studied hopping robots as a means to understand dynamic legged locomotion [5]. The first hopper was constrained to move in the plane. It had a pneumatic cylinder for its leg and hence acted as a springy inverted pendulum while on the ground. <p> This work is motivated by the dramatic success achieved by Marc Raibert in implementing simple control strategies to control physical hopping robots <ref> [5] </ref>.

The stance phase can be decomposed into three sub-phases: compression, thrust and decompression. <p> Raibert attempts to achieve these goals by treating hopping height and forward speed as separate control problems. This de-coupling of the control relies on a presumed weak coupling between the motions. He summarizes the control tasks as follows <ref> [5] </ref>: 1) Excite hopping motions and regulate their amplitude by specifying the thrust to be delivered by the leg on each hop. 2) Stabilize the machine's forward speed by extending the foot forward to a position that will provide the needed acceleration during stance.

Reference-contexts: While simulations suggest these assumptions are reasonable, more systematic studies are being undertaken to identify the regimes where these assumptions hold. 3.2 The Resulting Form of the Return Map Having found the maps for the stance and flight phases in <ref> [6] </ref>, we can now complete the expression for the return map. While R is technically a map from IR 4 to itself, we have reduced its order by one by restricting the state to the Poincare section defined by _ y = 0. <p> In the previous expression, b represents the change in angle from touchdown to bottom; it is obtained by integrating the stance dynamics and therefore depends strongly upon the form of U (r) <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> Moreover, it can be shown that z 2 is a necessary condition for z 2 FP and hence = F P <ref> [6] </ref>. In general, will be a curve in the z plane. To illustrate this, see Figure 2 which shows the fixed point curve for the closed loop system with the control law of section 4.2.2 introduced. <p> The physical significance of the condition fl = is that td and lo are symmetric about 2 . This symmetry in addition to the stance symmetry (r lo = r td , _r lo = _r td and _ lo = _ td ) shown in <ref> [6] </ref> yields a complete symmetry between the touchdown and liftoff conditions. <p> To study the local stability properties, we will find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of f u evaluated at the fixed point condition, which is shown in <ref> [6] </ref> to be 2 Technically, fl (z fl ) = (2n + 1) is the fixed point condition. However, since all these cases coincide on our state space topologically equivalent to the cylinder it is unnecessary to carry along the extra (2n+1). <p> This is easily verified, since the center eigenspace, i.e. that corresponding to the unity eigenvalue, is orthogonal to D z fl and hence tangent to the fixed point curve [1]. Moreover, locally for points in F P S the transverse dynamics are converging towards the center manifold <ref> [6] </ref>. The attracting portion, F P S , of the fixed point curve is bounded by the condition 2 &lt; a T b &lt; 0. <p> This work is completed in <ref> [6] </ref>, where an integral expression for b is derived. The analytical tractibility of that integral depends greatly on the choice of the spring law DU (r). <p> A 1 r 3 spring law is introduced and shown to result in a closed-form ex pression for b , which in turn allows us to completely specify a closed-form return map for the simplified planar hopper. The validity of the above assumption is demonstrated in <ref> [6] </ref> by showing that the force profiles for the 1 r 3 spring law and the commonly used 1 rr p spring law, as well as the phase portraits of the hopper corresponding to these spring laws are almost identical. 4.2.2 The Raibert Controller The above analysis was undertaken independently of <p> We have studied the local stability of these fixed points. Simulations suggest that both F P S and its domain of attraction grow as the spring constant is increased <ref> [6] </ref>. Furthermore, while Raibert's simple decoupled feedback yields good regulation, better regulation can be achieved using coupled feedback which takes into account the dynamic structure of the robot, such as the control law of section 4.2.3.
