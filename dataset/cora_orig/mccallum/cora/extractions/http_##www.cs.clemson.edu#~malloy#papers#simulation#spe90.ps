Abstract: Although the expressive power of retentive control is widely accepted, languages possessing such control forms are not always available. In this paper, we present an implementation technique to extend a recursive language to one containing simulation processes. In particular, we report on the design of a preprocessor that translates SimCal, a language that combines Pascal and the process abstraction of Simula, into Pascal. The translation is done automatically by the preprocessor without additional information from the user. The preprocessor has been implemented for a micro computer using Turbo Pascal, which is also used as the target language. SimCal has been found to be useful for teaching simulation and for programming simulation applications.
