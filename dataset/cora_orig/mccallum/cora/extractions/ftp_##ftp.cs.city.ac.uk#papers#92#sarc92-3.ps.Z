Reference-contexts: This system will provide the appearance of conventional shared memory by allowing sections of the Network Shared Memory to be accessed in a location transparent manner from any connected system. Such an approach greatly simplifies many problems associated with networked machines and provides a more general applications interface <ref> [Bel92] </ref>. Unlike conventional locally distributed shared memory, however, the problems of authenticity, persistence and access time are also addressed, and the classes of failures which must be handled are increased.

Reference-contexts: Because the vagaries of different network protocols are hidden beneath the memory, the usual problems incurred by incompatible methods of communication are hidden from the end user and even from the applications programmer, without compromising performance. Teleconferencing [MSO + 91], access to stored video, shared multimedia workspaces <ref> [Bra87] </ref> and access to other multimedia data all become trivial: data structures are mapped into network shared memory by all parties and information exchanged by writing and reading from them. In the supercomputing field, benefits can also be gained.

Reference-contexts: Namespace management. Global distribution of NSM must avoid centralised management of the namespace and avoid tying an implementation to one specific operating system or architecture. The first of these problems has been examined in other contexts <ref> [Moc89] </ref>. The second is addressed by separating the function of NSM from the method of access. Failure management. The reliability of networks of machines is low; everything will never be func 2 tional at the same time. It is important to realise this in NSM and to handle failures appropriately.

Reference-contexts: The Topsy machine is a scalable distributed memory multicomputer consisting of many PEs connected by a circuit-switched interconnection network. A number of machines of various sizes have been constructed. The 16 node machine <ref> [OB90] </ref> forms a suitable platform for the first implementation since it may be partitioned into several "virtual machines" for NSM development. Distributed virtual shared memory An extension of Meshix allows processes running on different PEs to share virtual memory regions [SWS92].

Reference-contexts: In particular the following developments are of direct relevance: Topsy DMMP and Meshix OS The Topsy multicomputer and Meshix operat ing system has been developed over a period of several years at City University <ref> [OSV + 92] </ref>. The Topsy machine is a scalable distributed memory multicomputer consisting of many PEs connected by a circuit-switched interconnection network. A number of machines of various sizes have been constructed.

Reference-contexts: However, conventions for exchanging data and applications will be proposed. This division between NSM and operating system is necessary to avoid tying NSM to one specific architecture. With Meshix <ref> [OSW + 92] </ref>, for example, NSM is accessed via System V shared memory primitives, whilst with SunOS NSM is accessed via mmap (). The NSM system provides the transport layer in the OSI/ISO communications model.

Reference-contexts: By grouping systems into wider and wider locality domains, network bandwidth and disk utilisation may be more efficiently used. 5. Addition to protocols to provide authentication. Although data security will not be considered because of the relatively high cost of a software implementation, authentication procedures <ref> [SNS88] </ref> will be examined in order to protect data from unpermitted access and modification. Thorough experimentation will then be used to determine the problems and the additions required for a refined solution. Each of the above steps will handle the components of failure management that are relevant to it.

Reference-contexts: The 16 node machine [OB90] forms a suitable platform for the first implementation since it may be partitioned into several "virtual machines" for NSM development. Distributed virtual shared memory An extension of Meshix allows processes running on different PEs to share virtual memory regions <ref> [SWS92] </ref>. A distributed coherency management algorithm ensures that data is exchanged and processes are blocked so that the expected semantics are preserved, while allowing parallel access to data for reading, and paging to disk when necessary.

CIS, University of Pennsylvania, </institution> <month> May </month> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: Not Distributed Shared Memory Distributed shared memory (DSM) demonstrates how disjoint machines can provide the facilities of a parallel machine through the use of efficient coherency policies and caching <ref> [TSF90] </ref>. Although Network Shared Memory provides similar services, its primary aims are to provide efficient data sharing and point-to-point exchange rather than support for general parallel programming. Consequently, NSM concentrates on maintaining a large persistent data space shared among thousands of globally distributed machines on an a variety of networks.

Reference-contexts: For example, two applications can communicate by sharing a section of NSM which is coherently maintained. This approach to communications proves more efficient than traditional message passing when the overheads of protection and authentication are considered <ref> [WO92] </ref>. The portable oce Using such a model, applications can be built which allow the concept of the portable office to be implemented.
