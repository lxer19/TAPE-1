Title: A SORTED PARTIAL JACOBI METHOD FOR COMPUTING SIGNAL SUBSPACES  
Author: HONGYUAN ZHA AND ZHENYUE ZHANG 
Abstract: Jacobi methods for computing the eigendecomposition of a class of so-called low-rank-plus-shift symmetric matrices are investigated. An order of magnitudereduction in the computational complexity can be achieved for this special class of matrices by terminating the Jacobi sweep early in a cyclic ordering. It is proved that these partial sweeps combined with sorting the diagonals still deliver quadratic convergence. It is also shown that useful results can still be obtained even if the low-rank-plus-shift structure only holds approximately. The resulted sorted partial Jacobi method is applied to computing the signal subspaces in direction-of-arrival finding of sensor array signal processing.

Reference-contexts: We also want to mention that there exit several other approaches to reducing the computational complexity of computing the signal subspaces. One notable approach is based on replacing the EVD or SVD by certain approximate decompositions such as the QR decomposition or URV decomposition <ref> [1, 25, 18] </ref>. The dimensions of the signal subspaces are estimated by using various rank-revealing mechanisms. One advantage of using these approximate decompositions is the ease with which to handle updating and downdating problems which can be crucial in an on-line environment.
