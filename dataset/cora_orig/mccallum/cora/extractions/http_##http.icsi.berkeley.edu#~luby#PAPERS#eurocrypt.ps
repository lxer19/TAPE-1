Abstract: A broadcast encryption system allows a center to communicate securely over a broadcast channel with selected sets of users. Each time the set of privileged users changes, the center enacts a protocol to establish a new broadcast key that only the privileged users can obtain, and subsequent transmissions by the center are encrypted using the new broadcast key. We study the inherent trade-off between the number of establishment keys held by each user and the number of transmissions needed to establish a new broadcast key. For every given upper bound on the number of establishment keys held by each user, we prove a lower bound on the number of transmissions needed to establish a new broadcast key. We show that these bounds are essentially tight, by describing broadcast encryption systems that come close to these bounds.

In [4] constructions and lower bounds for a model of unconditionally secure broadcast encryption are presented.

The efficiency of the systems in [4] is measured by considering the amount of secret information held by each user as compared to the information content of the broadcast made to establish the broadcast key; and the size of the broadcast as compared to its information content (i.e. it is an information theoretic model). <p> Because of the differences between our measurements of efficiency and those in <ref> [4] </ref>, the optimal systems in [4] are generally not optimal in our model. <p> Because of the differences between our measurements of efficiency and those in <ref> [4] </ref>, the optimal systems in [4] are generally not optimal in our model.

Reference-contexts: This is an important problem in the larger area of network security, and it has increased in prominence with the growth of the pay-television industry. Our model is a formalization of that of Fiat and Naor <ref> [7] </ref>. Each user initially holds a personalized subset of all possible establishment keys. Each time the center needs to establish a new broadcast key it enacts an establishment protocol. This protocol consists of a sequence of transmissions, each transmission is encrypted using a different establishment key. <p> Fiat and Naor <ref> [7] </ref> introduce broadcast encryption and describe several constructions. They focus on a feature of broadcast encryption systems called resiliency.
