Title: On the Expressiveness of Interactive Observers

Abstract: This paper shows that on-line observers are more expressive than off-line observers, where expressiveness for observers is defined as their ability to distinguish system behaviors. Observers are classified along the dimensions of off-line versus on-line, glass-box versus black-box, and nonstatistical versus statistical. Bisimulation is the basis for showing that glass-box on-line observers of system states are more expressive than off-line observers, while the Brock-Ackermann anomaly shows that black-box on-line observers of I/O behavior are more discriminating than off-line observers. Statistical observers observe the probability distribution of outputs and can make finer-granularity observational distinctions than non-statistical observers. The notion of pragmatics is introduced to describe multiple modes of system observation with different expressiveness. Our model of observability closely parallels empirical models and provides a general framework for interactive system observation and testing.

Reference-contexts: for showing that glass-box on-line observers of system states are more expressive than off-line observers, while the Brock-Ackermann anomaly (BA) furnishes an example to show that black-box on-line observers of I/O behavior are more discriminating than off-line observers. 1 BA models have been studied in the context of Actor models <ref> [Ag] </ref> while Bi models have been studied for process models [Mi, Pa]. These contexts are sufficiently different that we do not explicitly relate black-box and glass-box models of interactive expressiveness. <p> Grammars that use interaction equivalence as their equivalence criterion have been called interaction grammars [We2]. 4 Observing Black-Box Systems Systems are defined as sets of asynchronously communicating sequential processes from which Actor models <ref> [Ag] </ref> can be constructed. We show that on-line black-box observers of input-output behavior for such systems are more expressive than off-line observers. 4.1 Asynchronous Systems and their External Behavior A system is represented by a directed single-source single-sink graph.

Reference-contexts: This gives them the ability to analyze the output in "gray scale" as opposed to black-and-white. Their usefulness for observering system behavior can be compared to the usefulness of statistical grammars for Natural Language Processing <ref> [Ch] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We characterize bisimulation by an equivalence relation on grammars. 3 3.1 Glass-Box Equivalence Simulation of one system by another is specified relative to observers who impose a granularity of observation defined by an observation tree <ref> [DDM] </ref> whose nodes represent system states and whose edges represent state transitions: Definition 3.1 An observation tree T O (S) for a given system S and observer O represents the observable computations of the system. The root of T O (S) represents the start state of S. <p> S and S 0 are said to be bisimilar if S simulates S 0 and S 0 simulates S. The relation of bisimilarity, called bisimulation <ref> [Mi, Pa, DDM] </ref>, is a form of observational equiva lence: Systems S and S 0 are bisimilar if and only if they are observationally equivalent with respect to an on-line glass-box observer. In the rest of the section, all observers are glass-box unless stated otherwise.

Reference-contexts: The notion of an observer is related to the notion of a tester. A tester T is an observer with a correctness criterion; that is, for each observation t, T can determine whether t is correct (the case of test divergence is discussed in <ref> [DH] </ref>). A tester that compares two systems S 1 and S 2 to determine if they have the same behavior is known as an equivalence tester. Every observer can be used as an equivalence tester, so that there is a one-to-one correspondence between observers and associated observational equivalence relations.

Reference-contexts: Off-line pragmatics exemplify the traditional algorithmic model of computation, where the off-line IO behavior of the computing device, such as a Turing machine, provides the complete characterization of the computation <ref> [LP] </ref>. For all computable functions, we can construct a Turing machine whose IO behavior represents this function. This behavior, which we call algorithmic, is independent of the observer: any two systems implementing the same function will be equivalent.

Reference-contexts: Proof: On-line glass-box observers are at least as expressive as off-line observers. In addition, by Proposition 3.1, there exist pairs of systems distinguishable by the former but not by the latter. 2 3.2 Interaction Grammar Equivalence As <ref> [MS] </ref> points out, the difference between the -calculus expressions a:(b + c) and a:b + a:c can be expressed by the CFG grammars G 1 and G 2 : G 1 : S ! aX; X ! bjc G 1 and G 2 generate equivalent languages L (G 1 ) and

Reference-contexts: to the fields of real-time processing, image processing, natural language processing, as well as a connection to virtual reality suggested by the projection metaphor earlier, cause us to believe that the study of observed system behavior will prove to be a part of a broader study of all observable patterns <ref> [Mu] </ref>. Whereas algorithmic behavior is the same for all observers, on-line nonalgorithmic behavior differs for different observers even for simple Bi and BA examples. This means there is no single system description: a cross-product of modes of use is not adequate because of interdependence among them.

Reference-contexts: The greater expressiveness of on-line vs. off-line observers corroborates the claim in <ref> [We1, We2] </ref> that interactive systems can express richer behavior than algorithms or Turing machines. Section 2 defines observer expressiveness and distinguishes between off-line and on-line observers, as well as between glass-box and black-box modes of observation. Section 3 shows that bisimilarity is a form of glass-box observational equivalence. <p> As a result, behavior that cannot be distinguished by off-line observers is nonalgorithmic. Buffering outputs, as for S 2 in Section 4.2, is an example of nonalgorithmic behavior that does not affect the function computed but is interactively significant. Next, we corroborate the claim in <ref> [We1] </ref> that interactive systems have richer behavior than algorithms. Proposition 4.2 Systems with on-line pragmatics exhibit richer behavior than systems with off-line pragmatics. Proof: Let S off be any system with off-line pragmatics, and let O 1 and O 2 be any pair of off-line black-box observers. <p> We show that on-line observers can observe a greater range of system behaviors and corroborate the claim <ref> [We1] </ref> that interactive systems have richer behavior than algorithms. The observer filters system behavior through its observation mechanisms, projecting system behavior on an observable subspace just as in Plato's cave metaphor. Observers cannot completely observe systems just as human observers cannot completely observe the real world.

The distinction between on-line and off-line glass box behavior is expressed by bisimulation and more generally by interaction equivalence for grammars.
