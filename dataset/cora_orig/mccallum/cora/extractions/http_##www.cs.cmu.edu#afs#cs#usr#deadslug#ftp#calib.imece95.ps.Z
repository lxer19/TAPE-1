Abstract: We present a new technique for multi-axis force/torque sensor calibration called shape from motion. This technique retains the noise rejection of a highly redundant data set but eliminates the need for explicit knowledge of the redundant applied load vectors, yielding faster, more accurate calibration results. A constant-magnitude force (a mass in a gravity field) is randomly moved through the sensing space while raw data is continuously gathered. Using only the raw sensor signals, the motion of the force vector (the motion) and the calibration matrix (the shape) are simultaneously extracted by singular value decomposition. We have applied this technique to several types of force/torque sensors and present experimental results for a 2-DOF fingertip and a 6-DOF wrist sensor with comparisons to the standard least squares approach.

Reference-contexts: Angle Error (radians) tion 4, but we leave the important topic of experiment design to the classical textbooks in the field <ref> (e.g. Diamond, 1981) </ref>. Another potential experimental aw is induced by gathering the raw measurements while the sensor is in motion. This permits the quickest data collection with very dense coverage of the sensing space, but is subject to dynamic effects.

Reference-contexts: These external measurements generally involve scales, bubble levels, and protrac tors and can be very time consuming. Our technique eliminates the need to know M a priori by simultaneously determining M and S given only Z. We achieve this by performing a singular value de composition (SVD) <ref> (Klema and Laub, 1980) </ref> on Z.
