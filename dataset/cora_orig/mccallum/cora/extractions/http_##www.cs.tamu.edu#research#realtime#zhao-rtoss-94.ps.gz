Abstract: We report our ongoing research in real-time communication with FDDI-based reconfigurable networks. The original FDDI architecture was enhanced in order to improve its fault-tolerance capability while a scheduling methodology, including message assignment, bandwidth allocation, and bandwidth management is developed to support real-time communication. As a result, message deadlines are guaranteed even in the event of network faults.

Reference-contexts: Over the past two years, extensive studies have been carried out on this subject. The first comprehensive study on synchronous bandwidth allocation for FDDI was reported in <ref> [1] </ref>. In [5], an optimal bandwidth allocation algorithm was studied. An optimal algorithm can guarantee deadlines for all messages assigned to an FDDI ring whenever there is an allocation method that can do so. However, the optimal algorithm is complicated and may not be feasible for on-line use.

Reference-contexts: In [5], an optimal bandwidth allocation algorithm was studied. An optimal algorithm can guarantee deadlines for all messages assigned to an FDDI ring whenever there is an allocation method that can do so. However, the optimal algorithm is complicated and may not be feasible for on-line use. Consequently, in <ref> [2] </ref>, a localized bandwidth allocation method was developed. A localized scheme uses the information local to a node to allocate its synchronous bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Each station has certain reconfiguration capabilities that provide an additional level of fault-tolerance over that provided by the FDDI wrap-up 1 operation. In the case of (multiple) link 1 An FDDI trunk ring can recover from a single trunk link fault by wrapping up its dual counter-rotating loops <ref> [3] </ref>. faults, our FBRN automatically detects the occur-rence of faults and recovers by reconfiguring the trunk ring connections. This is achieved by judiciously reconnecting the fault-free segments of those trunk rings that could not be recovered by the normal FDDI wrap-up operation.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we report our work aimed at addressing issues related to fault-tolerant guarantees of synchronous message deadlines in FDDI-based networks, i.e., the transmission of messages before their deadlines, even in the event of network faults. FDDI is an ANSI standard <ref> [4] </ref> for a 100 Mbits/sec fiber optic token ring network. FDDI is a good candidate for mission-critical real-time applications, due not only to its high bandwidth, but also to its property of bounded token rotation time and its dual ring architecture.

An FBRN uses multiple FDDI trunk rings to connect network stations. Specifically, n stations are connected using r FDDI trunk rings. Figure 1 (a) shows an FBRN with four FDDI trunk rings connecting four stations. <p> The concentrator has the capability to reconfigure the connections (paths) among its various ports. A configuration monitor, resident on each FBRN concentrator, uses this ability to route packets among the fault-free ring segments incident on the node. Further details on FBRN implementation are discussed in <ref> [11] </ref>. 3 Scheduling Methodology We develop a methodology for scheduling message transmissions in an FBRN network so that message time constraints are guaranteed. The methodology consists of the following components: * Message assignment method.

Hence, the results obtained from our work will be immediately applicable to the design and analysis of distributed hard real-time systems where FDDI/SAFENET networks are used. In fact, SAFENET has adopted our bandwidth allocation method <ref> [16] </ref>, while it is currently considering our FBRN fault management method.

Reference-contexts: Message scheduling includes the arbitration of network access for each node, and the control of the length of transmission by each node. The deadlines of messages can be met only if access arbitration and transmission control are performed properly <ref> [17] </ref>. The above issues are addressed in our project. In particular, we enhance the FDDI architecture in order to improve its fault-tolerance capability. Furthermore, we develop a scheduling methodology to ensure the satisfaction of message time constraints. <p> This work complements previous work on the design of real-time communication networks [1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26].

Reference-contexts: Several new civilian and military networks have adopted FDDI as the backbone network. In particular, FDDI has been adopted by the Survivable Adaptable Fiber Optic Embedded Network (SAFENET) <ref> [18] </ref>. SAFENET is a military standard for computer networks developed with the Navy's Next Generation Computer Resources (NGCR) program. Although indispensable, the bounded token rotation time and the dual ring architecture alone are inadequate for guaranteeing message deadlines.

Reference-contexts: FDDI is a good candidate for mission-critical real-time applications, due not only to its high bandwidth, but also to its property of bounded token rotation time and its dual ring architecture. The bounded token rotation time <ref> [20] </ref> provides a necessary condition to guarantee hard real-time deadlines, while the dual ring architecture allows the maintenance of continuous real-time service under some failure conditions. Several new civilian and military networks have adopted FDDI as the backbone network.
