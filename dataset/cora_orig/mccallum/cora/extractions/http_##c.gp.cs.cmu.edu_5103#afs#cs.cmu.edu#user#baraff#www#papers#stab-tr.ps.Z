Reference-contexts: In order to exactly determine the impending motion direction, it is necessary to solve a quadratic programming problem <ref> [1] </ref>.) 3.2 Contact Forces Instead of looking at motion directions which decrease potential energy, we can consider the contact force that arises at each of the m contact points of the assembly.

Reference-contexts: It is only necessary to place constraints on the vertices of the convex hull of the contact region. In this paper, we assume that all contact regions are polygons (or degenerate polygons), which means that we have to formulate constraints for only finitely many contact points. Baraff <ref> [2] </ref> discusses the difficulties in dealing with nonpolygonal contact regions.

Reference-contexts: The first method is based on potential energy considerations, while the second method considers the contact forces that arise at contact points. Both methods involve linear programming. The latter method was used in work by Blum, Griffith, and Neumann <ref> [3] </ref>, and is not limited to frictionless assemblies. In the next section, we show how both of these methods for determining stability can be modified to find a stable orientation for the assembly (if it exists). 3.1 Potential Energy Suppose that an assembly undergoes a virtual displacement ffip.

Reference-contexts: Because the assembly is frictionless, its impending motion is completely determined <ref> [4] </ref>. If there exist repulsive contact forces such that the net force and torque on every body is zero, then such forces will arise at the contact points, and the assembly is stable and will not move.

Reference-contexts: Baraff [2] discusses the difficulties in dealing with nonpolygonal contact regions. We will assume that the motion constraints of the assembly can be expressed by a finite number of constraint inequalities in the form of equation (1), all of which must be satisfied. (Palmer <ref> [6] </ref> discusses the complexities that arise when only a subset of the motion constraints need to be satisfied by a given motion.) For the remainder of the paper then, we will consider assemblies whose motion constraints are expressed in terms of m contact points between the bodies.

Reference-contexts: The duality theory of linear programming <ref> [7] </ref> states that the optimal values of the two linear programs are equal: that is, v fl = (0; d T ) g fl ! The duality theory also states that (g fl T ) Mffip fl d Bffip fl = 0: (35) The fact that both vectors in this equation
