Abstract: VLSI communication networks are wire limited. The cost of a network is not a function of the number of switches required, but rather a function of the wiring density required to construct the network. This paper analyzes communication networks of varying dimension under the assumption of constant wire bisection. Expressions for the latency, average case throughput, and hot-spot throughput of k-ary n-cube networks with constant bisection are derived that agree closely with experimental measurements. It is shown that low-dimensional networks (e.g., tori) have lower latency and higher hot-spot throughput than high-dimensional networks (e.g., binary n-cubes) with the same bisection width.

Now that the latency of communication networks has been reduced to a few microseconds the latency of the processing nodes, T node , dominates the overall latency. To efficiently make use of a low-latency communication network we need a processing node that interprets messages with very little overhead.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The critical component of a concurrent computer is its communication network. Many algorithms are communication rather than processing limited. Fine-grain concurrent programs execute as few as 10 instructions in response to a message <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> Techniques to reduce T node are described in <ref> [7] </ref> and [11]. <p> This figure assumes constant wire delay, T c , and a message length, L, of 150 bits. This choice of message length was based on the analysis of a number of fine-grain concurrent programs <ref> [7] </ref>. Although constant wire delay is unrealistic, this figure illustrates that even ignoring the dependence of wire delay on wire length, low-dimensional networks achieve lower latency than high-dimensional networks. The latency of the tori on the left side of Figure 8 is limited almost entirely by distance. <p> To efficiently make use of a low-latency communication network we need a processing node that interprets messages with very little overhead. The design of such a message-driven processor is currently underway <ref> [7] </ref> [11]. The real challenge in concurrent computing is software. The development of concurrent software is strongly influenced by available concurrent hardware.

Reference-contexts: Throughput will be less than capacity because contention causes some channels to block. This contention also increases network latency. To simplify the analysis of this contention, we make the following assumptions: 15 * Messages are routed using e-cube routing (in order of decreasing dimension) <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> Thus, the average message rate on channels continuing in the dimension is C = R . 18 Using the average message rate to calculate latency is an approximation. The symmetry of the network assures that the traffic on physical channels is uniform. However, using virtual channels and e-cube routing <ref> [8] </ref> results in logical channels that form a spiral. Traffic on the j th channel of this spiral is given by Cj = 2k R .

Reference-contexts: The main result, that low-dimensional networks give minimum latency, however, does not change appreciably when logarithmic or linear delay models are considered. In choosing a delay model one must consider how the delay of a switching node compares to the delay of a wire. Current VLSI routing chips <ref> [9] </ref> have delays of tens of nanoseconds, enough time to drive several meters of wire. For such systems a constant delay model is adequate. As chips get faster and systems get larger, however, a linear delay model will more accurately reflect system performance. <p> The networks described here have been demonstrated in the laboratory and incorporated into commercial multiprocessors. The Torus Routing Chip (TRC) is a VLSI chip designed to implement low-dimensional k-ary n-cube interconnection networks <ref> [9] </ref>. The TRC performs wormhole routing in arbitrary k-ary n-cube interconnection networks. A single TRC provides 8-bit data channels in two dimensions and can be cascaded to add more dimensions or wider data channels.

Low-latency communication is also critical to support code sharing and garbage collection across nodes. As the grain size of concurrent computers continues to decrease, communication latency becomes a more important factor.

Reference-contexts: When the header flit of a message is blocked, all of the flits of a message stop advancing and block the progress of any other message requiring the channels they occupy. A method similar to wormhole routing, called virtual cut-through, is described in <ref> [13] </ref>. Virtual cut-through differs from wormhole routing in that it buffers messages when they block, removing them from the network. With wormhole routing, blocked messages remain in the network. distance and message aspect ratio.

Reference-contexts: A hot spot is a pair of nodes that accounts for a disproportionately large portion of the total network 24 traffic. As described by Pfister <ref> [18] </ref> for a shared-memory computer, hot-spot traffic can degrade performance of the entire network by causing congestion. The hot-spot throughput of a network is the maximum rate at which messages can be sent from one specific node, P i , to another specific node, P j .

This paper has considered only direct networks <ref> [19] </ref>. The results do not apply to indirect networks. The depth and the switch degree of an indirect network are analogous to the dimension and radix of a direct network. However, the bisection width of an indirect network is independent of switch degree.

Reference-contexts: The family of k-ary n-cube networks is described in Section 2.1. We restrict our attention to k-ary n-cubes because it is the dimension of the network that is important, not the details of its topology. Section 2.2 introduces wormhole routing <ref> [20] </ref>, a low-latency routing technique. Network cost is determined primarily by wire density which we will measure in terms of bisection width. Section 2.3 introduces the idea of bisection width, and discusses delay models for network channels. A performance model of these networks is derived in Section 3. <p> Each line in Figure 1 represents two communication channels, one in each direction, while each line in Figures 2 and 3 represents a single communication channel. 3 4 2.2 Wormhole Routing In this paper we consider networks that use wormhole <ref> [20] </ref> rather than store-and-forward [25] routing. Instead of storing a packet completely in a node and then transmitting it to the next node, wormhole routing operates by advancing the head of a packet directly from incoming to outgoing channels.

Reference-contexts: Thus, high-dimensional networks cost more and run more slowly than low-dimensional networks. A realistic comparison of network topology must take both wire density and wire length into account. To account for wire density, we will use bisection width <ref> [26] </ref> as a measure of network cost. The bisection width of a network is the minimum number of wires cut when the network is divided into two equal halves. Rather than comparing networks with constant channel width, W , we will compare networks with constant bisection width.
