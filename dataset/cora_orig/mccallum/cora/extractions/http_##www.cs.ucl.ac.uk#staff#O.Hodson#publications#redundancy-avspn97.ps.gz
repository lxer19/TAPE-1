Abstract: The use of redundant audio encoding has been advocated for lossy networks like the Internet[1, 2] as a way of reducing the impact of loss in audio-conferences. We present a model of loss and determine how the amount of redundancy should be varied with the loss rate. In addition, we make loss measurements and make a preliminary investigation of the position of redundant encodings relative to the original encoding.

Reference-contexts: The aim being to develop a mechanism that automatically adapts the number of levels of redundancy transmitted based on feedback from receivers. This feedback can be obtained from RTCP reports [5] that are periodically transmitted by each receiver. Bolot and Vega-Garca <ref> [2] </ref> have also collected and analysed packet losses for real-time audio streams over the Internet for unicast and multicast connections. They found comparable loss variations and suggested a relative reward based approach to covering losses. <p> This can be done by increasing the compression of the primary encoding and trading it for an increase in redundancy. An example is shown in figure 8. The measurements presented here and elsewhere <ref> [2, 13] </ref> there is a strong argument for offseting the redundant encoding from the primary encoding, particularly in noninteractive scenarios. The appropriate amount of offset can be determined by reception reports.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION IP Multicast allows real-time multiway audio and video conferencing over the Internet, and is now moving from pilotingstage to a service in countries such as the UK and the US <ref> [3] </ref>. Whilst video and shared data are essential to many distributed tasks, sufficient quality audio is a essential for real-time interaction. The effect of packet loss on audio quality is currently the largest obstacle to the re-alisation of multimedia conferencing over the Mbone.

Reference-contexts: Mbone audio packet sizes range from 20 to 160ms, with 40ms packets being the default. For interactive conferencing the coding delay and propagation time should be small ( 250ms <ref> [4] </ref>), however smaller packets require more work by the routers and have a larger relative packet header overhead [5]. The loss of larger packets has a more pronounced effect at the receiver.

Reference-contexts: Receiver based repair techniques are fundamentally limited by the non-stationary nature of speech, thus the longer the loss the less chance of a receiver has making an appropriate repair. Phonemes are typically 80-100ms in length <ref> [9] </ref>, thus the longer the gap in comparison to the length of a phoneme the less the chance of receiver repair being made successfully. The problem is compounded by the packet loss on international links, which is commonly 20-25%.

Reference-contexts: This means that audio tools that only use receiver based mechanisms to counteract packet loss cannot provide the minimum quality required to conduct a conversation over international and sometimes national links.

Reference-contexts: The Robust-Audio Tool, RAT [10], from UCL uses an audio redundancy technique that was developed in collaboration with researchers at INRIA <ref> [11] </ref>. Redundant audio information is piggy-backed onto a later packet (figure 1), which is preferable to the transmission of additional packets as this increases the amount of overhead for the transmission in respect to routing decisions and bandwidth.

The addition of a piggy-backed redundant encoding for the previous packet can provide fill-in audio for one lost packet. If two or more consecutive packets are dropped by the network then both the primary and redundant information for some period of time will be lost.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider benefits to the decoded stream rather than attributing scores based on the overhead and quality improvement. Handley has made similar observations of the loss patterns reported in this paper for video data over the Mbone <ref> [13] </ref>. 2 REAL-TIME AUDIO OVER THE INTERNET The Real-Time Protocol (RTP) is used to transport audio data over the network. The pertinent features for the purposes of our discussion are that every packet includes a sequence number, a timestamp, and a payload indicator for the data it carries [5, 14]. <p> This can be done by increasing the compression of the primary encoding and trading it for an increase in redundancy.
