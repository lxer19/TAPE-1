Reference-contexts: The DALI system is based on Caltech's Infospheres Infrastructure <ref> [2] </ref> and written in Java. Java is desirable because it is widely available and device independent. Also the object-oriented software paradigm simplifies alteration and extension of agents and environments required for different scenarios.
