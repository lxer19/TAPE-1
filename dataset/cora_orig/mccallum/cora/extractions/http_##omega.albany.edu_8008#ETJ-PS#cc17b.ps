Abstract: The development of our theory beyond this point, as a practical statistical theory, involves all the complexities of the use, either of Bayes' Law on the one hand, or of those terminological tricks in the theory of likelihood on the other, which seem to avoid the necessity for the use of Bayes' law, but which in reality transfer the responsibility for its use to the working statistician, or the person who ultimately employs his results." To the best of our knowledge, Norbert Wiener never actually applied Bayes' theorem in a published work; yet he perceived the logical necessity of its use as soon as one builds beyond the sampling distributions involved in his own statistical work. From our viewpoint, the necessity for this was established already in Chapter 2. In the present Chapter we are not concerned particularly with any abstract theory or with mathematical techniques; but rather with showing some of the pragmatic consequences of failing to use Bayesian methods in some very simple problems, where the mysteries of infinite sets never arise. These simple problems are just the ones that the "orthodox" school of thought believed that it had solved without using Bayesian methods; but in every case experience with the orthodox solution revealed defects that were corrected at once by use of Bayesian methods. In Chapter 16 we noted that the orthodox objections to Bayesian methods were always ideological in nature, never examining the actual results that they give in real problems, and we expressed astonishment that mathematically competent people would use such arguments. In order to give a fair comparison, we need to adopt the opposite tactic here, and concentrate on examining the pragmatic results. Indeed, since Bayesian methods have been so egregiously misrepresented in the orthodox literature, we must lean over backwards to avoid misrepresenting orthodox methods now; whenever orthodox methods do yield satisfactory results in some problem, we shall want to acknowledge that fact, and we shall not deplore their use merely on ideological grounds (although our educational purpose requires that we explain what the orthodox ideology is). On the other hand, when a common orthodox procedure leads to a result that insults our intelligence, we shall not hesitate to complain about it on pragmatic grounds. The demonstrable facts, which amount to many different confirmations of what Cox's theorems led us to expect, are quite sufficient to make our point. We have several independent ad hoc orthodox devices to consider. From the Neyman-Pearson camp of orthodoxy we have the principles of unbiased estimators, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests which amount to a kind of decision theory. From the Fisherian camp there are the principles of maximum likelihood, fiducial probability, randomization in design of experiments, analysis of variance, and a mass of significance tests. Our present goal is to understand just what results these principles yield in practice, independently of whatever rationale they might have to the orthodoxian; in particular we want to know this: In what circumstances, and in what ways, do the orthodox results differ from the Bayesian results?
