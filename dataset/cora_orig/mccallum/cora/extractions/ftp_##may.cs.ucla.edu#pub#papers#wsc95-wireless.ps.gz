BAGRODIA received the B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 1981 and the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin in 1983 and 1987, respectively. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Dept. at UCLA. His research interests include parallel languages, parallel simulation, distributed algorithms, and software design methodologies. He was selected as a 1991 Presidential Young Investigator by NSF. LEONARD KLEINROCK received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the City College of New York in 1957 and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D.E.E. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959 and 1963, respectively. He is currently a Professor in the Computer Science Department at UCLA. His research interests focus on performance evaluation and design of many kinds of networks (e.g., packet switching networks, packet radio networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks broadband and gigabit networks) and of parallel and distributed systems. Dr. Kleinrock is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Guggenheim Fellow, and an IEEE Fellow.
