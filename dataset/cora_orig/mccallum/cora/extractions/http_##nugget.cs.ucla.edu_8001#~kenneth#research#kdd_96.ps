Abstract: Geoscience studies produce data from various observations, experiments, and simulations at an enormous rate. Exploratory data mining extracts "content information" from massive geoscientific datasets to extract knowledge and provide a compact summary of the dataset. In this paper, we discuss how database query processing and distributed object management techniques can be used to facilitate geoscientific data mining and analysis. Some special requirements of large scale geoscientific data mining that are addressed include geoscientific data modeling, parallel query processing, and heterogeneous distributed data access.

Reference-contexts: Modeled as time-series of polygonal cells on the earth surface, these tracks can be used as content-based indexes that allow efficient access to "interesting" regions in a large geophysical dataset. There are obvious similarities between geoscientific feature extraction and data mining in business applications <ref> (Agrawal & Srikant 1995) </ref> (e.g., study stock market trends by correlating the price movements of selected stocks). They both involve sieving through large volumes of isolated events and data to locate salient (spatio-)temporal patterns in the data.

Reference-contexts: In addition, many problems do not fit the stream paradigm (e.g., slab multi-dimensional subar-ray extraction), and fit better into the storage management subsystem rather than the query execution engine <ref> (Graefe 1993) </ref>. As a result, it is often advantageous to optimize extraction of data from external data sources by pushing operations and filters into the data source to take advantage of efficient processing and reduce the amount of data that needs to be extracted out of the data source. <p> Query optimization in Conquest emphasizes paral-lelization and optimized data access. This is becasue we realized that the benefit of algebraic transformation <ref> (Wolniewicz & Graefe 1993) </ref> is limited due to the application-specific nature of scientific operators.

Reference-contexts: Introduction A tremendous amount of raw spatio-temporal data is generated as a result of various observations, experiments, and model simulations. For example, NASA EOS expects to produce over 1 TByte of raw data and scientific data products per day by the year 2000, and a 100-year UCLA AGCM simulation <ref> (Mechoso et al. 1991) </ref> running at a resolution of 1 ffi fi1:25 ffi with 57 levels generates approximately 30 TBytes of data when the model's output is written out to the database every 12 simulated hours.

Reference-contexts: Motivated by the requirements of geoscientific data mining applications, we are developing an extensible parallel geoscientific query processing system called Conquest <ref> (Shek, Mesrobian, & Muntz 1996) </ref>. In this paper, we describe the design of Conquest, concentrating on the features that make it especially suitable for geoscientific data mining, specifically geoscientific data modeling, parallel query processing, and heterogeneous distributed data access. <p> A description of our proposed approach to optimize access to heterogeneous datasets by taking advantage of the fact that some repositories can efficiently execute some operations can be found in <ref> (Shek, Mesrobian, & Muntz 1996) </ref>. In short, by consulting the data dictionary, a reference to a distributed object in a query execution plan may be mapped to a collection of scan operators to the underlying data repositories for the object. <p> OASIS <ref> (Mesrobian et al. 1996) </ref> is a complementary effort to Conquest at UCLA that aims to develop a flexible environment for scientific data analysis, knowledge discovery, visualization, and collaboration. It provides application developers, as well as end-users, the logical abstraction that the environment is simply a set of objects.

Reference-contexts: Distributed object management technologies merge the notion of location and platform transparency and object-oriented software technology. Emerging standards such as Object Management Group's Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) <ref> (Soley 1992) </ref> promise to provide a framework for distributed dataset integration by allowing uniform and convenient access to heterogeneous datasets. In CORBA, each object supports a well-defined interface that can have different implementations.
