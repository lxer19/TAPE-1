Abstract: This paper evaluates and characterizes the correlation between packet losses for two queueing systems in discrete time that are motivated by BISDN applications. The first, a two-class discrete-time queueing system, approximates the output queue of an ATM switch. The queue serves periodic foreground traffic and random background traffic. The background traffic is modeled as i.i.d. batches of arbitrary distribution. It is shown that the conditional loss probability (CLP) is independent of the buffer size if the buffer size is at least as large as the period of the foreground traffic. Example calculations indicate that losses occur essentially randomly as long as the foreground traffic uses less than 10% of the channel capacity. The second analysis derives the CLP seen by a selected stream in a slotted finite-buffer system with a superposition of interrupted Poisson sources. Here, the total number of arrivals may be correlated from slot to slot. Traffic correlation is seen to have a strong influence on loss correlation, while buffer size is seen to have virtually none.

Reference-contexts: Bursty traffic, as generated by multimedia applications, has made concerns about loss correlation more urgent. The investigation of loss correlation has a long history in the context of bit errors in data communication <ref> [1] </ref>, but has only recently attracted stronger interest in the area of packet networks. We briefly summarize related work, extending the review in [2]. By rate conservation methodology, Ferrandiz and Lazar developed a theoretical framework for studying loss correlation in queueing systems [3-5]. <p> These assumptions remain to be validated by analysis. Also, the cases of several heterogeneous sources and of sources with two different Bernoulli arrival processes (MMBP) rather than on/off sources deserve closer scrutiny (see [24, 25] for a loss probability analysis). In the Gilbert channel model <ref> [1] </ref>, the system alternates between two states in a manner identical to the IPP source. In one state, every packet is lost, in the other, no losses occur.

Reference-contexts: The investigation of loss correlation has a long history in the context of bit errors in data communication [1], but has only recently attracted stronger interest in the area of packet networks. We briefly summarize related work, extending the review in <ref> [2] </ref>. By rate conservation methodology, Ferrandiz and Lazar developed a theoretical framework for studying loss correlation in queueing systems [3-5]. Our focus is more on deriving computable results, relying on well-known Markov chain methods. <p> In some simulation studies, cell loss correlation has been investigated [12,13] and methods for the compensation of correlated cell loss have been proposed [14, 15]. This paper continues the work begun in <ref> [2] </ref>, extending it to derive the loss correlation seen by packets of a selected stream in queues with several arrival streams. <p> size plays almost no role in the value of the loss correlation, while the burstiness affects both LP and CLP in a similar way. 2 Superposition of Periodic and Random Traffic As a simple model of actual network traffic, we consider a discrete-time system similar to the one studied in <ref> [2] </ref>: single, first-come, first-serve queue with batch arrivals at every time slot and unit service time. The stream of interest is modeled as periodic (period t ), superimposed on background traffic with general, but i.i.d., batch arrivals. <p> It remains to be investiga ted whether the model can be applied nevertheless. Naturally, the mean of the success runs can be computed from the loss probability and the loss run length (see <ref> [2] </ref>). 3.4 Numerical Examples Compared to earlier systems, the large number of queueing system parameters (, fl, !, N , K, c) covers a wide range of systems, but also makes it difficult to generalize from numerical examples. <p> The tools provided should allow the computation of the loss correlation for a variety of sources of practical interest in high-speed networking. Continuing the theme of <ref> [2] </ref>, it was shown qualitatively that the buffer size has virtually no influence on the loss correlation.

Reference-contexts: In section 2, we briefly review results for a traffic model consisting of a periodic or general i.i.d. foreground source competing with a batch arrival process for queue resources. Details on these and related models and questions regarding service and buffering policies are addressed in a companion technical report <ref> [16] </ref>. In the main part of the paper, section 3, input traffic is modeled as a superposition of identical discrete-time interrupted Poisson (IPP) sources. IPP sources are commonly used to model voice and video traffic. <p> To gain insight into the loss behavior, we require transient rather than steady-state results. In this paper, we summarize some results for this system; details may be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. First, we can show: Theorem 1 The CLP for FT packets is independent of K for values of K t , where K is the system size. This behavior is shown in Fig. 2, where LP and CLP are plotted as a function of K. <p> This property carries over into this queueing system, as indicated by Fig. 4, and other examples not shown here. The effect of K will be small as long as most of the probability mass of the interarrival time is concentrated in the first K slots <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Multiplexors and other packet switch queues introduce delay jitter, thus, packet arrivals within a burst even of a on/off source will no longer be strictly periodic within the network.

In discrete-time [19, 20], the on/off periods are taken to be geometrically distributed.

Reference-contexts: There are c identical servers. Each customer requires a service time of one time slot. All customers arrive at the beginning of a slot, while the departure, if any, occurs at the end of the slot (so-called early arrival system <ref> [21] </ref>). We work towards the goal of computing the CLP (i.e., the conditional probability that customer n is lost given that customer n 1 from the same source was also lost) in several steps. First, immediately below, we characterize the aggregate arrival process.

Reference-contexts: As a closer approximation, we could treat the number of active sources as a birth-death process, as is commonly done for voice multiplexors <ref> [22, 23] </ref>, and then use numerical methods for sparse and block matrices. This approximation would probably improve in accuracy with larger N and longer state holding times. While the discussion has focused on the N IPP=D=c=K system, a number of extensions are immediately apparent.

Reference-contexts: These assumptions remain to be validated by analysis.

Reference-contexts: To provide a real-life example, the loss correlation in a DS1 voice multiplexor was determined. The DS-1/T1 channel offers a user capacity of 1.536 Mb/s. Following Heffes and Lucan-toni <ref> [26] </ref>, each source encodes speech in 64 kb/s and generates a 128-byte packet every 16 ms. Talk spurts and silence periods are geometrically distributed with means 352 ms and 650 ms, respectively, for an activity factor of 35%. When active, this source produces a packet every 24 slots.

Reference-contexts: Unlike voice sources, video sources have not been well characterized in terms of standard source models. We approximately model the CATV video coder of Verbiest and Pinnoo <ref> [27] </ref>. It has an average rate of 26.5 Mb/s and a standard deviation of 3.4 Mb/s. We assume that the coder transmits at channel capacity and that the active and silent period add up to the frame duration of 1/25 s.

Reference-contexts: Thus, appropriate packet interleaving or priority mechanisms must be used to reduce the incidence of noticeable display artifacts. Li also investigated the loss behavior for a voice source model <ref> [28] </ref> related to the N IPP=D=c=K queue studied here.
