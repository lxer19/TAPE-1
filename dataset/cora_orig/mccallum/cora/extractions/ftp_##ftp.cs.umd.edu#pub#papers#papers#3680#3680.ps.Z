Abstract: We take a tour of various themes in default reasoning, examining new ideas as well as those of Brachman, Delgrande, Poole, and Schlechta. An underlying issue is that of stating that a potential default principle is not appropriate. We see this arise most dramatically as a problem in an attempt to formalize what are often loosely called "prototypes", although it also arises in other formal approaches to default reasoning. Some formalisms in the literature provide solutions but not without costs. We propose a formalism that appears to avoid these costs; it can be seen as a step toward a population- based set-theoretic modification of these approaches, that may ultimately provide a closer tie to recent work on statistical (quantitative) foundations of (qualitative) defaults([1]). Our analysis in particular indicates the need to resolve a conflation between use and mention in many default formalisms. Our treatment proposes such a resolution, and also explores the use of sets toward a more population-based notion of default.

The iisi -constant theory presented here is able to model both reasoning with and about defaults (as can one of Delgrande's formalisms <ref> [5] </ref> and circumscription). <p> But counterexamples should be expected now and then as simple evidence that (4.12) is a default after all, and not a universal fact. Thus a default and counterexamples to the default should be able to coexist rather than the counterexample negating (denying) the default. 20 19 Delgrande <ref> [5] </ref> makes this same point. 20 This is addressed using a scoping mechanism in [10] and structural circumscription in [35]. However, neither scoping nor structural circumscription meets our needs: we want to avoid the default, not keep using it. <p> Three existing approaches are those of Delgrande, Poole, and Schlechta, which we discuss below. 5.1 Delgrande's approach Delgrande has developed default formalisms based on conditional logic in which, among other things, attention is paid to the representation of the denial of defaults (see [4] and <ref> [5] </ref>). <p> But to us this appears to hinge on an intuition that such an episode is an irregularity in a much larger time span during most of which birds do fly. Thus again there appears to be a vestige of statistics in the underlying intuitions. 24 See <ref> [5] </ref> for more on this.

Reference-contexts: For our purposes we need not choose a particular implementation of U nknown, though several possibilities come to mind, including fix-point consistency checking in the style of Reiter's Default Logic (DL) and McDermott and Doyle's NML (both undecidable), circumscription (semi-decidable), and the negative introspection facility of step-logics (decidable)[6], <ref> [7] </ref>. 6 3.1.2 Some pleasant features One nice feature of the iisi -constant approach to default reasoning is that, like circumscription, it requires no special logical connective (e.g., Delgrande's `)' connective [4], [5]) which is semantically distinguished from first-order material implication in order to write defaults.

Reference-contexts: a principal focus of this paper: how to represent the belief that a given default is inappropriate for use despite perhaps correctly reflecting what most of a class is like. 3 This may bear an interesting relationship to the notion (s) that exemplars and prototypes correspond to in Cognitive Psychology <ref> [8, 38, 22] </ref>; but we do not wish to take sides among the various competing theories there, hence we have adopted our own neutral term. 5 The distinction we wish to emphasize is that G can both use and mention individual-inference-stand-- ins, and that these are not the same activities. <p> So the iisi-constant formalism has encountered a seemingly insurmountable difficulty: the inability to express range defaults. This suggests that fictitious iisi -entities may not be good choices for a formal treatment of default reasoning despite any psychological evidence that people use similar mental representations <ref> [8] </ref>. As previously mentioned, formal treatments of fictitious entities are tricky. The above is one more illustration of this.

Reference-contexts: In fact, if the teacher were to use such a default, it may well lead to a version of the Lottery Paradox <ref> [15, 20, 10, 35] </ref>, since he may also have a strong belief that at least, say, 5% of the students will receive an A: then the default could lead him to guess that each individual student gets a B, which conflicts with the belief about some students receiving A's. <p> Thus a default and counterexamples to the default should be able to coexist rather than the counterexample negating (denying) the default. 20 19 Delgrande [5] makes this same point. 20 This is addressed using a scoping mechanism in <ref> [10] </ref> and structural circumscription in [35]. However, neither scoping nor structural circumscription meets our needs: we want to avoid the default, not keep using it. <p> The existence of a is asserted by (4.21) and the existence of b by (4.22). But much as noted in <ref> [10] </ref> the latter two counterexample axioms serve to block the use not merely of the mystiques but also of the desired default that people typically are gendered! 22 The following theorem makes this precise, even when j I j= n &gt; 2. <p> Now for D to be true (since (a) holds, and since W i2I i (a) fails because each i (a) fails) then Ab ;f i g i2I (a) must hold; 23 this requirement is easily satisfied by interpreting 22 There are possible ways around this, of course <ref> [10, 35] </ref>. However, the ones we are aware of involve yet further complicating of the formalism. <p> Asserting that "typically birds are animals," since " all birds are animals," is surely misleading as the former encourages the listener to assume that some birds are not animals. Grice's [12] maxim "be maximally informative" supports this view, as does the claim espoused in <ref> [10] </ref> which states that it is in the very nature of a default to have counterexamples.

Reference-contexts: Much effort in artificial intelligence has been directed toward the development of logic-based approaches for interpreting, representing, and reasoning with and about typicality statements. A variety of formalisms have been proposed including, but not limited to, Delgrande's conditional logic [4], [5] McDermott and Doyle's NML <ref> [21] </ref>, Reiter's Default Logic (DL)[36], McCarthy's circumscription [17], Poole's hypothetical reasoning framework [32], and Schlechta's treatment of defaults as generalized quantifiers [37]. 1 Each of these formalisms treats typicality statements|which henceforth we denote X typ !

Delgrande helps point out another nice feature of the iisi formalism by distinguishing the ability to reason with defaults from the ability to reason about defaults. Reasoning with a default is simply using it to come to a conclusion about an individual instance of the default rule. <p> So we are in a quandary; we will analyze and attempt to resolve this in Section 6 below. In brief preview the issue seems to revolve around the difference between individual-oriented default representations (as in DL, NML, and circumscription) and population-oriented default descriptions. (For related comments see <ref> [21] </ref>, p. 44, where a distinction due to Scriven is described.) 4.2.3 Denial in circumscription Circumscription also has problems with denied defaults, much like those of NML.

Reference-contexts: A variety of formalisms have been proposed including, but not limited to, Delgrande's conditional logic [4], [5] McDermott and Doyle's NML [21], Reiter's Default Logic (DL)[36], McCarthy's circumscription [17], Poole's hypothetical reasoning framework <ref> [32] </ref>, and Schlechta's treatment of defaults as generalized quantifiers [37]. 1 Each of these formalisms treats typicality statements|which henceforth we denote X typ ! Y without intending any bias toward a particular formalism|somewhat differently in its interpretation of typicality, in technique, and in its success in modeling the whole of default <p> We first noticed the need for denials of defaults in exploring the issue of "range defaults" [23]. In that and other papers [24, 25] we have continued to investigate denials. Several other researchers (Delgrande [4, 5], Poole <ref> [32] </ref>, Schlechta [37]) have independently studied default denials. <p> However, usual default reasoning aims to draw conclusions about individuals whereas Delgrande's treatment turns this around to draw conclusions about defaults. Thus if a reasoner knows about an entire population of individuals, it might very well reason about what defaults to adopt from that knowledge. 5.2 Poole's approach Poole <ref> [32] </ref> bases his work on the premise that reasoning is not a matter of deduction but of theory formation. He views default reasoning as an attempt to use a set of hypotheses and a set of facts to explain observations.

Reference-contexts: In fact, if the teacher were to use such a default, it may well lead to a version of the Lottery Paradox <ref> [15, 20, 10, 35] </ref>, since he may also have a strong belief that at least, say, 5% of the students will receive an A: then the default could lead him to guess that each individual student gets a B, which conflicts with the belief about some students receiving A's. <p> Thus a default and counterexamples to the default should be able to coexist rather than the counterexample negating (denying) the default. 20 19 Delgrande [5] makes this same point. 20 This is addressed using a scoping mechanism in [10] and structural circumscription in <ref> [35] </ref>. However, neither scoping nor structural circumscription meets our needs: we want to avoid the default, not keep using it. <p> Now for D to be true (since (a) holds, and since W i2I i (a) fails because each i (a) fails) then Ab ;f i g i2I (a) must hold; 23 this requirement is easily satisfied by interpreting 22 There are possible ways around this, of course <ref> [10, 35] </ref>. However, the ones we are aware of involve yet further complicating of the formalism.

Reference-contexts: a principal focus of this paper: how to represent the belief that a given default is inappropriate for use despite perhaps correctly reflecting what most of a class is like. 3 This may bear an interesting relationship to the notion (s) that exemplars and prototypes correspond to in Cognitive Psychology <ref> [8, 38, 22] </ref>; but we do not wish to take sides among the various competing theories there, hence we have adopted our own neutral term. 5 The distinction we wish to emphasize is that G can both use and mention individual-inference-stand-- ins, and that these are not the same activities.
