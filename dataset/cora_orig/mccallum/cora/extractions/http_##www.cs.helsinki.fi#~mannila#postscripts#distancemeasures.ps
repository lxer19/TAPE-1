Abstract: We consider the problem of measuring the similarity or distance between two finite sets of points in a metric space, and computing the measure. This problem has applications in, e.g., computational geometry, philosophy of science, updating or changing theories, and machine learning. We review some of the distance functions proposed in the literature, among them the minimum distance link measure, the surjection measure, and the fair surjection measure, and supply polynomial time algorithms for the computation of these measures. Furthermore, we introduce the minimum link measure, a new distance function which is more appealing than the other distance functions mentioned. We also present a polynomial time algorithm for computing this new measure. We further address the issue of defining a metric on point sets. We present the metric infimum method that constructs a metric from any distance functions on point sets. In particular, the metric infimum of the minimum link measure is a quite intuitive. The computation of this measure is shown to be in NP for a broad class of instances; it is NP-hard for a natural problem class. fl Authors' addresses: Thomas Eiter, Information Systems Department, Technical University of Vienna, Paniglgasse 16, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; Heikki Mannila, Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki, P.O.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, our results imply that for a broad class of instances, computing d ! l is NP-easy, i.e., possible in polynomial time with an oracle for some problem in NP (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>), and hence not much harder than the NP-complete problems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. <p> that for all x and nonempty S yields a closest point of S for x, i.e. (x; S) = y; such that y 2 S and (x; y) = m (x; S): We assume that the reader knows about basic concepts of graph theory (cf.

Reference-contexts: The weight w (M ) of M is w (M ) = P e2M w (e). It is well-known that a perfect matching of minimum weight (hence, by our assumptions, also its weight) in G can computed in polynomial time (cf. <ref> [10] </ref>). Specialized algorithms have been developed for bipartite graphs and for other graph classes. Proposition 4.1 (cf. [10, p.93,Theorem 14]) Let G = (V 1 [ V 2 ; E; w) be a bipartite weighted graph with nonnegative weights from the reals. <p> It is well-known that a perfect matching of minimum weight (hence, by our assumptions, also its weight) in G can computed in polynomial time (cf. [10]). Specialized algorithms have been developed for bipartite graphs and for other graph classes. Proposition 4.1 (cf. <ref> [10, p.93,Theorem 14] </ref>) Let G = (V 1 [ V 2 ; E; w) be a bipartite weighted graph with nonnegative weights from the reals. <p> Since all capacities are integer, a minimum integral s-t flow of value v = c 0 m on N is computable in time O (ve N (log n N )= maxflog (e N =n N ); 1g); n N = jV j; e N = jEj <ref> [10, p. 92, Theorem 13] </ref>. The result follows. 2 4.4 Computing the link distance d l It remains to show that the link distance function d l is computable in polynomial time. As in the case of d s , we reduce this problem to a perfect matching problem. <p> Proof. Consider sets S and S 0 . The graph G 00 for S and S 00 can be constructed in polynomial time. A minimum cost perfect matching in G 00 can be computed in polynomial time, cf. <ref> [10] </ref>; hence the result follows. 2 The graph G 00 is bipartite by the partition of the vertex sets constituted by A [ B 0 and A 0 [ B.

The reason is that the Hausdorff distance does not take into account the overall structure of the point sets (see Figure 1). Several alternative distance functions between subsets have been proposed in philosophy of science <ref> [13] </ref>, for the objective of measuring the distance between theories in a logical language L. <p> The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After introducing the some notation at the end of the introduction, we review in Section 2 measures for the distance of point sets derived from measures of theory distance from <ref> [13, 22, 14] </ref>. Furthermore, in this section we define the new minimum link measure d l and compare it to the distance measures d md ; d s , and d fs . <p> A comparative analysis of these measures, from the viewpoint of philosophy of science, can be found in <ref> [13] </ref>. We further propose a new distance function which overcomes weaknesses of previously suggested distance functions in some situations. <p> Therefore we do not consider d h in the sequel. Sum of minimum distances (d md ) The sum of minimum distances function d md <ref> [13] </ref> is defined by d md (S 1 ; S 2 ) = 2 @ e2S 1 X m (e; S 1 ) A : This function takes into account the distances between each element and the other set. <p> Then d md , d s , d fs , and d l are distance functions on P ; (B). 2 For a discussion of the relationships and properties of d md , d s , and d fs , the reader is referred to <ref> [13] </ref>. As mentioned above, these functions have been considered for measuring the distance between logical theories. However, they have also applications in other contexts. The minimum distance measure is appealing in many cases. For example, suppose the distance between two countries with respect to travelling should be determined.
