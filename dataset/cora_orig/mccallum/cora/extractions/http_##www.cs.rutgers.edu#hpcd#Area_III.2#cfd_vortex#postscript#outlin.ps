Abstract: The vortex collapse-reconnection process presents behaviors commonly observed in turbulent flows: multiple spatial and temporal scales, rapid vorticity and strain-rate amplification and dissipation through generation of small scales. In this work we re duce the computational complexity of our problem by using hierarchical methods (tree codes), introducing a time extrapolation framework for each particle, and applying a filament "surgery" algorithm, based on the energy density, as a regularization for vortex collapse. The high performance parallel implementation of Barnes-Hut algorithm permit us to increase by one order of magnitude the resolution of the vortex collapse simulations. The use of the time extrapolation for slow moving particles helps in concentrating the computational effort in the important dynamic domains. The vortex filament surgery regularizes effectively the growth of the number of particles in the collapse regions of the flow. The reduction in complexity achieved will contribute to optimize the use of the numerical simulations in the reduced model building process.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The study of small scales formation in high Reynolds number flows is of fundamental importance because of the relationship this process has with important areas of engineering applications, including drag reduction and mixing <ref> [1] </ref>. The study of these types of flows tends to require substantial amount of computational resources. In multi-filament models, the O (n 2 ) nature of the computational expense of the Biot-Savart direct method (where n is the number of grid points) severely limits the resolution of the simulations [2].

In multi-filament models, the O (n 2 ) nature of the computational expense of the Biot-Savart direct method (where n is the number of grid points) severely limits the resolution of the simulations <ref> [2] </ref>. The objective of our work is to adapt a high performance O (n log n) parallel implementation of N-Body algorithms [3, 4] to the vortex dynamics problem and extend it by including a filament surgery algorithm based on the energy density [5]. <p> Our initial condition is a multi-filament vortex ring constructed around the center line ( 1 ; 2 ; 3 ) = (a cos ; b sin ; c sin 2) ; (18) where 0 2 and which we call the "Lissajous-elliptic" ring <ref> [2] </ref>. The thickness of the multi-filament ring is ffi C . The circulation distribution p , and the initial filament core radius ffi p also need to be specified. Low aspect ratio elliptic rings a &gt; b; c = 0 have periodic behavior that can be used for dynamic testing. <p> More recently, Chorin (1990, 1993) [25, 26] introduced a hairpin removal and filament surgery algorithm based on proximity and orientation in the theoretical framework of the "infinite temperature" state. In previous studies of vortex collapse <ref> [5, 2] </ref>, it is found that the energy density of the collapsing region in the filament tends to zero as the collapse time is approached. This signature of collapse occurs despite the observed increase in the self-energy. <p> Our numerical results are as follows. In figure 4 we present the effect obtained by using 9 different energy density thresholds d for a single-filament collapsing vortex ring at t = 0:23, with the constant core model <ref> [2] </ref>. Whereas for d = 0 there is practically no small scales removal, these are removed more efficiently as the energy density threshold is increased. It can be noticed that the only region affected by the surgery corresponds to the collapse region.
