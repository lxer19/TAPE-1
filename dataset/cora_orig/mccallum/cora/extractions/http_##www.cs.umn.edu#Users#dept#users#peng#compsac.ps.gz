Title: On Integrating Existing Bibliographic Databases and Structured Databases

Abstract: It is widely accepted that future digital library applications have to be built upon different kinds of database servers to draw from them different forms of data. These data include bibliographic data, text data, multimedia data as well as structured data. In this paper, we address the problem of integrating existing bibliographic and structured databases which reside at different locations in the network. To integrate bibliographic data and structured data, we extended the well-known SQL model to represent bibliographic related attributes and queries. In particular, we have added a new data type to model attributes in the bibliographic database. We have also designed specialized predicates and functions that can be used to formulate queries on bibliographic data alone as well as queries on both bibliographic and structured data. By combining our SQL extensions with the other SQL extensions that model general text data, we believe that a versatile query language layer can be made available to our future digital library application development.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, these proposed schemes do not suit the bibliographic data well since the latter share a more restrictive structure governed by the international standard, i.e. MARC <ref> [6] </ref>. Hence, the design of a new extended relational model and query language for bibliographic data becomes necessary. Our problem of integrating existing bibliographic and structured databases is very much related to the area of multidatabase research [7].

Reference-contexts: Recently, a strong effort in standardizing remote library retrievals has resulted in the ANSI Z39.50 protocol <ref> [8] </ref>. Z39.50 has been implemented at many libraries (including Data Research Public Library, AT&T Research Library and Nanyang Technological University Library) and most library software vendors are quick in adopting it. Queries to bibliographic databases managed by Z39.50 servers have to be specified as Z39.50 search requests. <p> Therefore, we introduce a new predicate Contain () for comparing an attribute of MarcString data type with a normal string. The design of Contain () adheres closely to the suggested Bib-1 query semantics agreed by Z39.50 Implementator Group <ref> [8] </ref>.
