Abstract: This paper extends Bennett's integral from scalar to vector quantizers, giving a simple formula that expresses the rth-power distortion of a many-point vector quantizer in terms of the number of points, point density function, inertial profile and the distribution of the source. The inertial profile specifies the normalized moment of inertia of quantization cells as a function of location. The extension is formulated in terms of a sequence of quantizers whose point density and inertial profile approach known functions as the number of points increases. Precise conditions are given for the convergence of distortion (suitably normalized) to Bennett's integral. Previous extensions did not include the inertial profile and, consequently, provided only bounds or applied only to quantizers with congruent cells, such as lattice and optimal quantizers. The new version of Bennett's integral provides a framework for the analysis of suboptimal structured vector quantizers. It is shown how the loss in performance of such quantizers, relative to optimal unstructured ones, can be decomposed into point density and cell shape losses. As examples, these losses are computed for product quantizers and used to gain further understanding of the performance of scalar quantizers applied to stationary, memoryless sources and of transform codes applied to Gaussian sources with memory. It is shown that the shortcoming of such quantizers is that they must compromise between point density and cell shapes.

Reference-contexts: For scalar quantizers, Bennett's integral was extended to rth-power distortion by Algazi [6]. It was extended to vector quantizers with congruent cells (as in a lattice quantizer) by Gersho <ref> [5] </ref>. Yamada et. al. [7] gave a Bennett-like lower bound to distortion that applies to all vector quantizers and difference distortion measures. Bucklew [8,9] extended Bennett's integral to companders in higher dimensions. All these results were heuristically formulated and derived. <p> Therefore, D (S,C) @ N p (x) l (x) which is the new version of Bennett's integral for vector quantizers. Note that it is similar to the formula derived in <ref> [5] </ref> except that instead having a single moment of inertia that applies to all cells, it contains the inertial profile m (x). Equation (1.7) shows that distortion decreases as 1/N r/k , with proportionality constant depending on the source density, point density and inertial profile. <p> the normalized moment of inertia and, consequently m (x), can never be less than that of a k-dimensional sphere, V r/k /(k+r), where V k is the volume of a k-dimensional sphere with radius 1, D (S,C) r/k N 1 r/k dx , which also follows from the results of <ref> [5] </ref>. For scalar quantizers, the cells are almost always taken to be intervals, and the quantization points are usually taken to be the midpoints. In this case, m (x) = 1/12, assuming r = 2, and (1.7) reduces to Bennett's integral for scalar quantizers (1.2). <p> II. APPLICATIONS OF BENNETT'S INTEGRAL A. Optimal and Suboptimal Quantizers Two important questions are: What is the least distortion among quantizers with a given dimension and size? And, what are the best point density and inertial profile for a given dimen sion? According to Gersho's widely believed conjecture <ref> [5] </ref>, when N is large, most cells of the best k-dimensional quantizers are congruent, approximately, to the tessellating polytope H * r,k with minimum normalized moment of inertia. <p> Assuming such, the best inertial profile is the constant: m * (x) r,k D r,k and either calculus of variations or Hlder's inequality can be used to show that (1.7) is minimized by the point density <ref> [5] </ref> l * (x) = p (x) p (x') . (2.2) Substituting (2.1) and (2.2) into (1.7), one finds that the least distortion of any k-dimensional quantizer with N points is D * @ M * N k/(k+r) d x , (2.3) 5 which is the well known Zador-Gersho formula. <p> Zador [15,16] derived the form of (2.3); Gersho <ref> [5] </ref> recognized that the multiplicative constant is M * r,k .

Reference-contexts: Moreover, if one can explicitly compute (or at least bound or estimate) the point density and inertial profile induced by a particular structure, then one can use Bennett's integral to quantify the resulting loss of performance. Examples of qualitative and quantitative loss analyses include those of treestructured quantization <ref> [20] </ref>, twostage quantization [21,22], scalar quantization (Subsection C below) and transform coding (Subsection D below). In the following we show how to separately identify the losses due to the point density and the inertial profile.

Reference-contexts: C. Scalar Quantizers We now address the frequently asked question: Why do vector quantizers outperform scalar quantizers for stationary, memoryless sources? The best answer to date is given by Lookabough and Gray <ref> [25] </ref>. By examining the point density and cell shape losses of kth power quantizers, we are able to add further insight. <p> To do so, consider a stationary, memoryless source -X k - with first-order density p 1 (x 1 ) and k-dimensional joint density p (x) = p 1 (x 1 ) p 1 (x k ). We follow the approach of <ref> [25] </ref> and compare scalar quantization to vector quantization by comparing the features of kth-power quantizers to those of the best k-dimensional quantizers. (A kth-power quantizer is just an alternate description of a scalar quantizer.) Let N 1 denote the size of a scalar quantizer, and let l 1 denote its point <p> The cubic loss is the cell shape loss that would occur if the cells were entirely cubes; i.e., it is the smallest possible cell shape loss for kth-power quantizers. Lookabough and Gray <ref> [25] </ref> called it the space filling loss 4 . It has been conjectured that a cube has the smallest n.m.i. of any polytope with 2k faces (or, at least, of any such tessellating polytope) [26]. <p> density, the distortion does not decrease as rapidly as 1/N 2 11 * (3k-2)/3k dx 1 p 1 (x 1 ) 2 p 1 (x) k+2 L ob D = p 1 (x 1 ) (3k-2)/3k dx 1 (2.11) The product of these has been called the shape loss 4 <ref> [25] </ref>, because it is due to the "shape" of p 1 - for a more uniformly shaped p 1 , the optimal scalar point density c p 1 (x 1 ) 1/3 is more uniform and, consequently, less of a compromise from the scalar point density c p 1 (x 1 <p> The decomposition into point density and cell shape losses shows quantitatively the effects of this compromise. For sources with memory, there is also a loss due to the point 12 density not reflecting the correlation. This is well expressed by the memory loss quantified in <ref> [25] </ref>. D.

Although the performance of such codes is well understood in the high-rate case <ref> [28] </ref>, we obtain additional insight by reexamining them from the point density, cell shape viewpoint. <p> In contrast, the choice that minimizes point density loss is easily shown to cause L ob = , just as with power quantizers. The best transform code, as found in <ref> [28] </ref>, is a compromise, which we now summarize. Given an arbitrary orthogonal matrix T, the scalar quantizers should be chosen so that the resulting product quantizer is optimum for Y.
