Abstract: This paper describes an approach to diagnosis of systems described by qualitative differential equations represented as Qsim models. An implemented system Qdocs is described that performs multiple-fault, fault-model based diagnosis, using constraint satisfaction techniques, of qualitative behaviors of systems described by such models. We demonstrate the utility of this system by accurately diagnosing randomly generated faults using simulated behaviors of a portion of the Reaction Control Sys tem of the space shuttle.

Reference-contexts: Each of these systems concentrates on different aspects of the monitoring process, but none performs the multiple-fault fault-based diagnosis that Qdocs performs. Two other systems that perform diagnosis on dynamical systems include Cats <ref> (Dague et al., 1991) </ref> and Sidia (Guckenbiehl and Schafer-Richter, 1990). Both are systems that use numerical methods to obtain conflicts and perform diagnosis on circuits with state but neither one can a) handle fault modes, or b) generalize to qualitative differential equations.

Reference-contexts: Previous approaches to diagnosing faults in Qsim models have either been unable to work with fault models (Ng, 1990) or have made a single-fault assumption <ref> (Dvorak, 1992) </ref>. Most previous work on model-based diagnosis (for example, (Reiter, 1987) or GDE (de Kleer and Williams, 1987)) has concentrated on static systems and is insufficient to diagnose continuous systems. <p> Qdocs, on the other hand, does use behavioral mode information to find a model consis-tent with the behavior and it uses a complete constraint satisfaction algorithm. The other previous diagnosis work on Qsim models, Mimic <ref> (Dvorak, 1992) </ref> suffers from a number of different problems. First, Mimic requires the model builder to provide a structural model of the system in addition to the Qsim constraint model. This structural model was fixed and could not change under different fault models.

Reference-contexts: These subsystems help deliver the fuel and oxidizer into a reaction chamber where they ignite to provide thrust. A model of one of these subsystems has been successfully described qualitatively using Qsim and simulated in various fault modes <ref> (Kay, 1992) </ref>. For this experiment, we further concentrate on about half of this subsystem consisting of the helium (propellant) tank, the two pressure regulators and the fuel tank.

Reference-contexts: A very general language for describing physical systems as qualitative differential equations is given by Qsim (Kuipers, 1994), a program that simulates systems described in this language. Previous approaches to diagnosing faults in Qsim models have either been unable to work with fault models <ref> (Ng, 1990) </ref> or have made a single-fault assumption (Dvorak, 1992). Most previous work on model-based diagnosis (for example, (Reiter, 1987) or GDE (de Kleer and Williams, 1987)) has concentrated on static systems and is insufficient to diagnose continuous systems. <p> This work is an initial attempt at building a general, multiple-fault diagnosis system which uses behavioral mode information with a priori probabilities. The diagnostic architecture is similar to Sherlock (de Kleer and Williams, 1989) and the algorithm builds on the work of <ref> (Ng, 1990) </ref> in Inc-Diagnose. A general constraint satisfaction technique is used to detect faults and trace dependencies. <p> However, Qsim requires a more complete constraint satisfaction algorithm since a qualitative constraint typically does not entail a unique value for a remaining variable when all its other variables have been assigned. An earlier attempt to use Qsim to track dependencies for diagnosis <ref> (Ng, 1990) </ref> only used a simple propagator. Since the propagator alone is not complete, it is not guaranteed to detect all inconsistencies. <p> We intend to explore ways in which to cache this information and test their utility in improving the efficiency of Qdocs. 6 Related Work The two previous systems implemented to perform diagnosis on systems modeled using Qsim both suffer from a number of limitations that Qdocs does not. Inc-Diagnose <ref> (Ng, 1990) </ref> was an implementation of Reiter's theory of diagnosis (Reiter, 1987) to Qsim models.

Reference-contexts: The process of finding successors to states and filtering on the constraints continues as Qsim builds a tree of states called an envisionment. Qsim solves the CSP by 1) establishing node consistency, 2) using Waltz filtering <ref> (Waltz, 1975) </ref> to establish arc consistency, and, finally, 3) using backtracking to assign values to variables.
