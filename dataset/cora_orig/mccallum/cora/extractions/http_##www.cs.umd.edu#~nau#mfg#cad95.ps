Abstract: All mechanical designs pass through a series of formal and informal redesign steps, involving the analysis of functionality, manufacturability, cost and other life-cycle factors. The speed and efficacy of these steps has a major influence on the lead time of the product from conceptualization to launching. In this paper we propose a methodology for automatically generating redesign suggestions for reducing setup costs for machined parts. Given an interpretation of the design as a collection of machinable features, our approach is to generate alternate machining features by making geometric changes to the original features, and add them to the feature set of the original part to create an extended feature set. The designer may provide restrictions on the design indicating the type and extent of modifications allowed on certain faces and volumes, in which case all redesign suggestions generated by our approach honor those restrictions. By taking combinations of features from the extended feature set generated above, we can generate modified versions of the original design that still satisfy the designer's intent. By considering precedence constraints and approach directions for the machining operations as well as simple fixturability constraints, we can estimate the setup time that will be required for each design. Any modified design whose setup time is less than that of the original design can be presented to the designer as a possible way to modify the original design.

Reference-contexts: In Step 5 (c)i, Find-Best-Setup-Time uses a procedure called Holding-Analysis to find alternative sets of features K that can be machined in one setup. How the procedure Holding-Analysis works is briefly described in Appendix C (details of the procedure is provided in reference <ref> [6] </ref>). Holding-Analysis assumes that a vise is the only available fixturing device|but we are developing procedures for use with other types of work-holding devices (such as clamping), and we intend to use these procedures to augment the set K.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we describe a structured methodology for automatically generating redesign suggestions for reducing setup costs for machined parts. 1 The basic steps of our approach are shown in Figure 1. In most previous work on automated redesign <ref> [14, 17, 18] </ref>, the approach has been for the system to propose one or more modifications, such that each modification produces a local improvement in the manufacturability of the design. <p> Moreover, the objective of their work was only to minimize the number of approach directions for machining the part|and as will become clear in Section 4.2.1, this will not always reduce the setup time. Hayes et al. <ref> [14] </ref> reported some advances in the direction of making redesign suggestions based on process planning knowledge. They did a protocol study to find the basic rules process planners use to reduce machining difficulty. Their approach attempts to reduce the number of setups by eliminating the setups with relatively fewer operations. <p> These infeasible design attributes are then modified using predefined rules to create improved designs. Due to interactions among machining operations, it can be very difficult to determine the manufacturability of a design directly from the design description|and thus the applicability of direct systems is rather limited. Indirect systems <ref> [15, 14, 17] </ref> proceed by generating a detailed manufacturing plan, and modifying various portions of the plan in order to reduce its cost. Once this has been done designs that correspond to these modified plans are presented to the user as possible redesigns.

Reference-contexts: As opposed to this approach we attempt to reduce the number of setups by looking at the part as a whole and at the various alternative ways of manufacturing the part.

This methodology takes into consideration the initial conditions of the stock like the surface conditions.
