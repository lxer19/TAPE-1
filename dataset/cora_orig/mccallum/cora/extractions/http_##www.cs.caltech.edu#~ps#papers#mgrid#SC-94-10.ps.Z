Reference-contexts: First, for a given p we define p+1 equidistant points f~ i = i=p; i = 0; 1; : : : ; pg on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Appropriate polynomials in one volume coordinate are l I (L k ~ 0 )(L k ~ 1 ) (L k ~ I1 ) 0 &lt; I p (8) 0 (L k ) := 1.

Reference-contexts: Then shape functions for an arbitrary tetrahedron are given via an affine variable transformation <ref> [2] </ref>. It is convenient to use volume coordinates L 1 = 1 x y z; L 2 = x; L 3 = y; L 4 = z; (7) instead of the cartesian coordinates x; y; z.

Reference-contexts: First we define the local basis functions used in our FEM. From the very beginning it was clear that the standard linear shape functions were unsuitable to achieve high accurate results [17]. Thus we additionally implemented higher order (p = 2 - 5) polynomials of the Lagrange type <ref> [3] </ref>. It is sufficient to construct these local polynomials for a reference tetrahedron with corner points p 1 = (1; 0; 0), p 2 = (0; 1; 0), p 3 = (0; 0; 1), p 4 = (0; 0; 0), as shown in figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Aside the three examples for which we obtained highly accurate results the program should be applicable to a rather broad range of relevant problems. For instance it would be worthwhile to test the adaptive FEM for the treatment of diabatic H + 2 <ref> [15] </ref>, for the approximation of correlated two-electron wavefunctions [4,53-56], for the study of the dynamical stability question of the H + e + system [50], for the vibrational motion of a mass in other three dimensional potentials, or for one-electron wavefunctions in other multi-center Coulomb systems.

Reference-contexts: However, a sophisticated reduction of the computational work is possible with the concept of adaptivity.

Reference-contexts: We now turn to the second step of the multilevel method plotted in figure 1: the general matrix eigenvalue problem (3). For a given grid and polynomial order p the matrix elements (4) of H and S are computed by a sufficient accurate Gauss integration formula <ref> [22, 23] </ref>. To get the FEM approximation ~ we must solve the general matrix eigenvalue problem (3). In the case of very coarse grids and corresponding small matrix dimensions M this is done by Givens rotation.

Increasing the accuracy of the gaussian integration formula from a 210 point formula (order 13) to a 495 point formula (order 17) <ref> [23] </ref> lowers the energy only by 5e-10. Thus the uncertainty of this value is mainly determined by the accuracy of the diagonalisation technique described in section 2. By this we assume an error in the order of 1.e-9 for the final quintic eigenvalue in table 3.

Reference-contexts: The linear system (11) is solved via a Cholesky decomposition of the matrix (H ~ S). To minimize the matrix fill-in produced by the Cholesky decomposition, the numbering of the basis function is reordered by the reverse Cuthill-McKee method <ref> [24] </ref>, but the fill-in is still proportional to M log M and the amount of operations for solving the linear system is at least O (M 3=2 ). Thus for very high dimensions the linear systems (11) are solved via the iterative conjugate gradient (CG) method.

Reference-contexts: A more rigorous analysis and justification of the discretization and localization of the defect equation (14) leading to the local error estimates (21) should be possible by the theory of space decomposition <ref> [25] </ref>. The refinement of the grid has to be done in a way preserving the numerical stability of the FEM approximation. This requirement is strongly connected to the geometrical aspects of the grid.

Reference-contexts: After the regular refinement of the tetrahedra selected a non-conforming triangulation results. To obtain a conforming triangulation the transition between refined and non-refined tetrahedra must be completed. This is done, after further regular refinements, which may be neccessary for structural reasons <ref> [31] </ref>, by the green closures in figure 4. Irregular tetrahedra are never refined, instead all irregular refinements are skipped and the father tetrahedra are regular refined. For a more detailed description of the local refinement we refer to the literature mentioned above.

We come to a convergence behavior <ref> [33] </ref> ffiE (p) (N ) = O (D 2p 9 gridpoints for polynomial order p = 1; 2; 3; 4; 5 (from above). in the adaptive case. Ideally, both, the uniform refinement and the adaptive refinement, show a very similar asymptotic convergence behaviour.

Reference-contexts: On the other side it is well-known that such a reduction of the convergence order can be avoided if the singularity of the solution is isolated in a small tetrahedron <ref> [35] </ref>. To test the adaptive FEM for this kind of problems we use the quantum Hamiltonian for the adiabatic two-center one-electron problem in cartesian coordinates H = 2 for Z 1 = Z 2 = 1 (H + 2 molecule) and j R j= 2:0.

Note that benchmark calculations with 9 accurate figures have been reported <ref> [45] </ref> for the much more complicated two-electron ion H + 3 . From a theoretical point of view, it is also of interest to investigate the Hamiltonian (30) for arbitary Z-values, as it has be done for diatomic systems [46-51,and literature therein].

Reference-contexts: For instance it would be worthwhile to test the adaptive FEM for the treatment of diabatic H + 2 [15], for the approximation of correlated two-electron wavefunctions [4,53-56], for the study of the dynamical stability question of the H + e + system <ref> [50] </ref>, for the vibrational motion of a mass in other three dimensional potentials, or for one-electron wavefunctions in other multi-center Coulomb systems. An extension of the method to nonlinear systems, on the other hand, would enable very accurate basis free Hartree-Fock or density functional treatments for arbitrary multi electron systems.

Reference-contexts: Based on rigorous theoretical results it is proven, that the homonuclear one-electron diatomic system in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation can have only monotonically decaying potential curves if Z&gt; 4 <ref> [52] </ref>. This is exactly the Z-value entailing the instability of the corresponding classical electrostatic system. The critical charge (Z = 1:5) for the instability of the classical triatomic system may play a similar role for the binding of the quantum three-center one-electron problem.
