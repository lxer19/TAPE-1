Abstract: 12 Large Engineering Knowledge-Bases We did not touch problems like maintenance of large knowledge-bases, because this requires more experience which can be obtained only from practice of using large knowledge-bases. Finally, it seems that a realistic way to get a universal engineering knowledge-base is by evolutionary development. This reminds us again how people are being taught. The crucial question in this case will be the ability of a knowledge-base system to perceive the knowledge, i.e. to learn gradually.

These experiments have given us the confidence that all kinds of engineering knowledge can be already presented in computer by means of now available knowledge tools.
