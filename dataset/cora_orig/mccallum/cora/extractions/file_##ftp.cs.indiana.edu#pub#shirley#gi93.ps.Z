Abstract: An algorithm is presented that scales the pixel intensities of a computer generated greyscale image so that they are all displayable on a standard CRT. This scaling is spatially nonuniform over the image in that different pixels with the same intensity in the original image may have different intensities in the resulting image. The goal of this scaling transformation is to produce an image on the CRT that perceptually mimics the calculated image, while staying within the physical limitations of the CRT.

Reference-contexts: A real-world greyscale image r is a member of the set of all such real images R. If we parameterize the radiances that define r over some image plane, we can represent any real image as a mapping from <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 to a radiance. If we view radiance as a positive scalar, we can write down the set of all real images as: R = frjr : [0; 1] 2 For display purposes, an image in R is mapped to a discrete-domained raster image 2 defined on a n <p> we parameterize the radiances that define r over some image plane, we can represent any real image as a mapping from <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 to a radiance. If we view radiance as a positive scalar, we can write down the set of all real images as: R = frjr : [0; 1] 2 For display purposes, an image in R is mapped to a discrete-domained raster image 2 defined on a n x by n y pixel grid of pixels P = f0; ; n x 1g fi f0; ; n y 1g. <p> three considerations: that it is a simple function whose shape is controllable by n, that the sum of the filter coefficients is one, and that it has a zero first derivative at its boundary, which is needed to avoid the introduction of Mach bands into the image (for example, see <ref> [1] </ref>). The result of passing this filter with w = 121, n = 8 and k = 0:8 is shown in Figure 10. This is the same basic approach used by Nakamae et al. to generate their very impressive driving simulation animations, although they only run their filter over luminaires.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we discuss our current thinking and speculate on future solutions in Section 7. 2 Test Image Our test image is of a room lit by a single incandescent bulb. This image was generated using distribution ray tracing <ref> [2] </ref> for the direct lighting, and a physically plausible ambient component to approximate the indirect lighting. We compared the luminances in this image to the luminances in a real room 1 , and found the range and location of luminance values to be fairly consistent. <p> S max is just the inverse of f and is shown in Figure 4 where zero maps to black, and 50.0 maps to white. We should try to discover other simple properties S should have. In the same way stochastic sampling relies on the eye's insensitivity to noise <ref> [2] </ref>, we should design S with human visual properties in mind. Land [8] and Marr [10] have argued that the eye is not sensitive to luminance so much as reflectance. As a result of this, slow spatial variation in luminance is to some extent ignored by the eye.

Reference-contexts: This is often referred to as a gamut mapping problem because the gamut (set of distinct colors) in the image we wish to display is not a subset of the CRT gamut. Spatial limitations of CRTs have also been explored, usually in the language of signal processing (e.g. <ref> [6, 11, 3] </ref>). Perhaps the greatest limitation of the CRT, its small dynamic range, has received relatively little attention. This limitation particularly manifests itself when we wish to display images with contain both high and low radiance values. <p> The spatial limitations of CRTs is examined in detail in Glassner's book <ref> [3] </ref>. Of these steps, the transformation from raster image f 2 F , to normalized raster image, ^ f 2 ^ F is the one we will concentrate on.

Of course, the final image on the screen is a member of some subset of ^ F (having the same cardinality as D), because at each pixel a continuous phosphor kernel will be generated, and the overlapping kernels of all pixels form an image continuous in space. <p> Figure 1). These artifacts can be reduced in severity if a more continuous transform is used <ref> [5] </ref>, but either the image will still appear too dark, or the antialiasing near luminaires will be compromised, as will be discussed in Section 5. Tumblin and Rushmeier noted that the adaptation level of the observer should be considered in designing the uniform mapping.

Reference-contexts: The amount of scattering which occurs is different for each viewer. Factors which determine the scatter include the age of the viewer, the viewer's distance from the viewed object and the intensity of the object <ref> [7] </ref>. 4 Since the blooming effect is highly viewer dependent, the development of our model for introducing glare into the image is empirical. <p> We are fairly sure that blooming is caused by imperfections in the lens, and that diffraction is not an important mechanism in blooming. According to the IES Lighting Handbook <ref> [7] </ref>: Diffractionregardless of whether rays are in focus or not, there is always a certain amount of blur due to the diffraction of light. This determines the ultimate resolving power when the eye is in best focus, but the blur is not large enough to be perceived.

Reference-contexts: In order to avoid Mach bands, the interpolation function must maintain a continuous derivative in the blurred image. 3 In fact, the technique of using a blurred f as a filter has been used before in photography and in image processing. In the so called unsharp masking technique, <ref> [9] </ref>, the image filtered with a Gaussian filter, or some other blurring filter, is subtracted from the original image to get an image enhanced in sharpness. This technique may cause negative pixels, so the subtracted image is often scaled down, or the absolute value of the difference is used.

Reference-contexts: In a more general algorithm, some angular distance related to field-of-view would probably be more appropriate. We tried several other filters, such as the cone filter, the Gaussian filter, and the Perlin <ref> [13] </ref> filter. However, as long as the filter was wide, we saw no obvious differences in the results. To avoid darkening near the edge, we normalized the weights of the kernel pixels within the image boundaries so that they summed to one. <p> This technique is really meant to enhance features in the image rather than to make the image perceptually correct. For ease of calculation we used Perlin's interpolation function <ref> [13] </ref>, which has this property in its derivative.

Reference-contexts: The work presented in this paper is meant to be exploratory, and is not meant to be an alternative to the approach of Tumblin and Rushmeier <ref> [18] </ref>. This paper presents spatially varying image mappings without considering adaptation issues. Tumblin and Rush-meier take an orthogonal approach and concentrate on adaptation issues (making dark scenes look dark and bright scenes look bright). Both Tumblin and Rushmeier and this paper ignore issues involving color. <p> If we had a perceptual distance metric, ^ f would simply be the image closest to f . This error minimization strategy has been applied by Glassner et al. for gamut-mapping [4] and for brightness mapping by Tumblin and Rushmeier <ref> [18] </ref>. In determining ^ f , the characteristics of the human visual system should be considered. <p> We can use these constraints to investigate scaling strategies. 6 An Ad Hoc Scaling Function Tumblin and Rushmeier state that some vision researchers have speculated that the adaptation level in a part of the image is related to a low pass filter of the image <ref> [18] </ref>. It seems natural to make S (i; j) proportional to the reciprocal of a filtered (blurred) f .

Reference-contexts: Nakamae et al.[12] modeled two types of glare. The first was blurring or blooming, where a hazy fog is visible around the luminaire (see Figure 9). The second was streaking, where star-like smears emanate from the luminaires. This streaking is also implemented in Ward's Radiance program <ref> [19] </ref>. We have only implemented the blooming effect. In a real scene a glare or blooming effect can be observed near objects of high intensity. This is the result of light scattering within the eye.

Reference-contexts: Currently we are working on finding a theoretical basis for these results. One way to interpret the final scaling function we used is that we have filtered the image using multiple scales of the form proposed by Witkins in his scaled space filtering work <ref> [20] </ref>. We think that this is a good area to investigate and we hope it will yield a more hands-off approach. Future work should also account for dark adaptation, chromatic adaptation, time varying adaptation for walk-throughs, and optical illusions.
