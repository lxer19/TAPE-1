Abstract: We have presented architectural and communication issues in designing large-scale heterogeneous parallel systems using passive star-coupled optical interconnection. It has been shown that the no-code-migration task scheduling strategy generally performs better than the subtask-code-migration strategy. This shows that increases in the capacity and the I/O bandwidth of the local disks and memory can have a great impact on reducing the task completion time. Thus, if a problem with large subtask code sizes is being solved on a system with slow disk I/O, or small disk capacity, the subtask-code-migration strategy may perform better than the other strategy due to the heavy penalty imposed by page-faults. The hierarchical interconnection on a passive star-coupled optical network leads to a significant reduction in the contention for the master's channel, and makes the system scalable. However, while trying to execute large tasks composed of several subtasks, with a high degree of parallelism amongst them, the number of levels in the hierarchy needs to be chosen carefully. Fewer levels than the optimum will not be able to reduce contention to the minimum, while more levels than the optimum will increase the execution time due to repeated copying of the results as they are propagated up the hierarchy towards the master. Time division multiplexed access to the master's channel can provide communication service comparable to the hierarchical communication protocol. However, when choosing TDMA as the communication protocol, the number of slots in a cycle and the slot duration should be considered. The hierarchical communication protocol that employs the ALOHA protocol at all the levels is independent of these considerations. So, it is suitable for a wider range of applications. The TDMA protocol may perform significantly better than the hierarchical protocol for a very small set of applications, while providing inferior service for a large number of the applications. Laboratory prototypes of several key components required for building heterogeneous systems are currently available. The analysis and results presented in this paper provide guidelines for building such a system to deliver high performance while minimizing communication overheads and channel contention. [1] N.
