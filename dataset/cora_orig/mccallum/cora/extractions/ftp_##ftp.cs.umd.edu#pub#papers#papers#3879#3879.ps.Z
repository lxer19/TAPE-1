Abstract: Current network data exploration systems which use command languages (e.g. SQL) or form fill-in interfaces fail to give users an indication of the distribution of data items. This leads many users to waste time posing queries which have zero-hit or mega-hit result sets. Query previewing is a novel visual approach for browsing huge networked information warehouses. Query previews supply data distribution information about the database that is being searched and give continuous feedback about the size of the result set for the query as it is being formed. Our within-subjects empirical comparison studied 12 subjects using a form fill-in interface with and without query previews. We found statistically significant differences showing that query previews sped up performance 1.6 to 2.1 times and led to higher subjective satisfaction.

Reference-contexts: It takes control away and does not give guidance that leads to a successful result. Recent research showed that improved methods exist for more efficient querying. For example, the Butterfly System [7] and the Harvest System <ref> [2] </ref> show that efficient querying is possible on the World Wide Web. These systems also attack the problem from the information processing and system utilization sides.

Reference-contexts: The application of dynamic querying to networked querying environments might be useful. On the other hand, high system-resource demands make dynamic querying less applicable to huge networked information warehouses. One solution to this problem uses data aggregation in tandem with dynamic queries <ref> [5] </ref>. Another solution to this problem might be the division of the bigger problem into several smaller problems, as in query previews and overviews [3,4,8]. The paradigm is to give an overview of the database to users before the details are visualized.

Reference-contexts: Introduction of networked information systems and frequent changes in the amount, type, and format of data make the problems even more challenging. A common example of informationseeking tools is search engines on the World Wide Web. Users enter keywords to a user interface that has text entry fields <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, the Butterfly System [7] and the Harvest System [2] show that efficient querying is possible on the World Wide Web. These systems also attack the problem from the information processing and system utilization sides. Veersamy and Navathe <ref> [11] </ref> address the problem of the relevance of the results of a query to the keyword set and propose a user interface solution. Dynamic queries [1,9,12] use a direct manipulation approach to facilitate query formulation with a visual representation of query components and results.
