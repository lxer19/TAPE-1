Abstract: Information Integration is one of the core problems in distributed databases, cooperative information systems, and data warehousing, which are key areas in the software development industry. Two critical factors for the design and maintenance of applications requiring Information Integration are conceptual modeling of the domain, and reasoning support over the conceptual representation. We demonstrate that Knowledge Representation and Reasoning techniques can play an important role for both of these factors, by proposing a Description Logic based framework for Information Integration. We show that the development of successful Information Integration solutions requires not only to resort to very expressive Description Logics, but also to significantly extend them. We present a novel approach to conceptual modeling for Information Integration, which allows for suitably modeling the global concepts of the application, the individual information sources, and the constraints among different sources. Moreover, we devise inference procedures for the fundamental reasoning services, namely relation and concept subsumption, and query containment. Finally, we present a methodological framework for Information Integration, which can be applied in several contexts, and highlights the role of reasoning services within the design process.

Reference-contexts: The Source Model capturing the concepts and the relationships of the new source that are critical for the enterprise is produced. Since in a typical setting, sources already exist, this task may be accomplished through a reverse engineering activity <ref> (Batini, Ceri, & Navathe, 1992) </ref>. However, it is worth stressing that the Source Model is really meant to capture the semantics of the domain, independently of the organization of the data recorded in the physical structures. <p> An example of structural conflict is represented by the situation where the same concept is represented as a class in one model and as a relation in another model. The principles for resolving such conflicts are now well established <ref> (Batini et al., 1992) </ref>. Other types of conflicts are dealt with in the Quality Analysis step. The specification of intermodel assertions and the derivation of implicit relationships by exploiting the reasoning techniques, represent the novel part of the methodology.

Reference-contexts: Early work on integration was carried out in the context of database design, and focused on the so-called schema integration problem, i.e. designing a global, unified schema for a database application starting from several subschemata, each one produced independently from the others <ref> (Batini, Lenzerini, & Navathe, 1986) </ref>. More recent efforts have been devoted to data integration, which generalizes schema integration by taking into account actual data in the integration process.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, we make use of the first decidability result on query containment for a Description Logic with n-ary relations <ref> (Calvanese, De Gia-como, & Lenzerini, 1998) </ref>. Based on these reasoning methods, we present a methodological framework for Information Integration, which can be applied both in the virtual and in the materialized approach.

Reference-contexts: Once a formalization of the model in terms of DLR is provided, checking several interesting properties of the model becomes possible, and can be used to help correctness and optimality of the design. We refer to <ref> (Calvanese et al., 1994) </ref> for a discussion on using the inference techniques associated to Description Logics during Source Model construction. (2) Source Model integration. The Source Model is integrated into the Domain Model. This can lead to changes both to the Source Models, and to the Enterprise Model.

Reference-contexts: We formalize the notion of interdependency by means of so called intermodel assertions <ref> (Catarci & Lenzerini, 1993) </ref>, which provide a simple and effective declarative mechanism to express the dependencies that hold between entities (i.e. classes and relationships) in different models (Hull, 1997). <p> L 6j L 0 ) if I does not satisfy L v L 0 (resp.

To specify knowledge on the conceptual interrelationships among the sources and/or the enterprise, we use intermodel assertions <ref> (Catarci & Lenzerini, 1993) </ref>, which have essentially the form of intramodel assertions, although the two relations (concepts) L and L 0 belong to two different conceptual models M i , M j .

Reference-contexts: Indeed, this worst-case complexity is inherent to the problem, therefore reasoning with respect to a DM is EXPTIME complete. The inference method works in two steps: first, reasoning on the DM is reduced to reasoning on a knowledge base expressed in the Description Logic CIQ <ref> (De Giacomo & Lenzerini, 1996) </ref>; then reasoning procedures for CIQ, based on the correspondence with Propositional Dynamic Logics, are exploited. For reasoning at the logical level, we provide suitable techniques for query containment.

Reference-contexts: Based on these reasoning methods, we present a methodological framework for Information Integration, which can be applied both in the virtual and in the materialized approach. In comparing our framework with other declarative approaches, we observe that in both Carnot and SIMS, reasoning is based on formalisms, Cyc <ref> (Lenat & Guha, 1990) </ref> and LOOM (MacGregor, 1991) respec-tively, that are undecidable. Information Manifold uses the Classic (Patel-Schneider, McGuiness, Brach-man, Resnick, & Borgida, 1991) Description Logic at the conceptual level, and extends it with conjunctive queries at the logical level.

Reference-contexts: In this case, query containment helps to identify the set of subqueries to be issued on the sources and to extend and/or restructure the Materialized View Schema (see step 5 of source-driven integration). Different choices can be identified, based on various preference criteria. E.g., in <ref> (Levy et al., 1995) </ref> minimization in terms of the number of sources is proposed, based on the observation that accessing a source is the most expensive part of the process.

Reference-contexts: Here the input is a collection of source data sets (each one constituted by a schema and actual data), and the goal is to provide an integrated and reconciled view of the data residing at the sources, without interfering with their autonomy <ref> (Ullman, 1997) </ref>. We only deal with the so-called read-only integration, which means that such a reconciled view is used for answering queries, and not for updating information. Data integration can be either virtual or materialized.

Reference-contexts: They do not require an explicit notion of integrated data schema, and rely on two kinds of software components: wrappers that encapsulate sources, converting the underlying data objects to a common data model, and mediators <ref> (Wiederhold, 1992) </ref> that obtain information from one or more wrappers or other mediators, refine this information by integrating and resolving conflicts among the pieces of information from the different sources, and provide the resulting information either to the user or to other mediators.
