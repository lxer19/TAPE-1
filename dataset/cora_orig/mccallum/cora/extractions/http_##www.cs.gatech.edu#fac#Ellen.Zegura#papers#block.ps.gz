Title: Evaluating Blocking Probability in Generalized Connectors  
Author: Ellen Witte Zegura 
Abstract: Generalized connectors provide the capability to connect a single input to one or more outputs. Such networks play an important role in supporting any application that involves the distribution of information from one source to many destinations or many sources to many destinations. We present the first analytic model for evaluating blocking probability in generalized connectors. The model allows flexibility in specifying traffic fanout characteristics and network routing algorithms. Equations are derived for computing blocking probability for the important class of series-parallel networks. We investigate the accuracy of the equations by comparing the blocking probability computed using the equations to results from simulation.

Reference-contexts: When the outputs are in stage k, the network is called a k-stage network. The topology of many interesting networks can be described by two simple construction operators originally proposed by Cantor <ref> [2] </ref>. If N 1 is a network with n 1 outputs and N 2 is a network with n 2 inputs, then the series connection of N 1 with N 2 is denoted N 1 fi N 2 and is constructed as shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this work is to develop an efficient, accurate and flexible analytic model for evaluating blocking probability in generalized connectors. Previous work includes well known models for evaluating blocking probability in connectors, networks that support one-to-one transfer of information. Lee's model <ref> [5] </ref> gives upper bounds on blocking probability in connectors. Pip-penger improves upon Lee's model with exact equations for a particular class of networks, those that are series-parallel [8].

Reference-contexts: This allows one to model, for example, a network in which copies are made in the early stages and point-to 7 point routing occurs in later stages, a technique which has been considered for some ATM networks <ref> [9] </ref>. The equations derived in the previous section can be modified to give the blocking probability under the General Model.

Reference-contexts: For example, using f (u) = 0:0 in the first half of the network and f (u) = u=d in the second half of the network would model the type of routing found in Turner's cascaded Clos networks <ref> [10] </ref> in which branching is restricted to the second half of the network.
