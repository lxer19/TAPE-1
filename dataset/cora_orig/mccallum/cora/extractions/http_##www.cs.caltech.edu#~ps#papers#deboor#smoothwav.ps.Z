Abstract: We apply the general theory of approximation orders of shift-invariant spaces of [BDR1-3] to the special case when the finitely many generators L 2 (IR d ) of the underlying space S satisfy an N -scale relation (i.e., they form a "father wavelet" set). We show that the approximation orders provided by such finitely generated shift-invariant spaces are bounded from below by the smoothness class of each 2 S (in particular, each 2 ), as well as by the decay rate of its Fourier transform. In fact, similar results are valid for refinable shift-invariant spaces that are not finitely generated. For the special case of a singleton , our first class of results (that are concerned with the condition 2 W k1 2 ) improve previously known results of Yves Meyer and of

Reference-contexts: We do note that the former implies the latter and both imply that b (0) 6= 0.) We add here that Theorem 2.4 of [JM] can be combined with Theorem 1.15 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, to show that, for the specific value k = 1, Result 1.4 is valid under very mild decay conditions on . Note that all the above quoted results show that smoothness may imply approximation orders, and none addresses the converse statement. <p> Assume further that for some N &gt; 1, " 1 2 6= 0. Let f be compactly supported. If f ? S, then b f has a zero of order k at the origin. Proof. From Theorem 1.13 we conclude that S provides approximation order k. Theorem 4.1 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref> then applies to yield that for some compactly supported supported 2 S, the ladder S () provides approximation order k, too. Theorem 3.7 of [R2], when combined with Theorem 1.1 of [R1], allows us to assume without loss that b does not have any 2-periodic zero. <p> Theorem 3.7 of [R2], when combined with Theorem 1.1 of [R1], allows us to assume without loss that b does not have any 2-periodic zero. On the other hand, Theorem 1.14 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref> implies that b must have a zero of order k at each j 2 2ZZn0. This forces b (0) to be non-zero, and, by a standard argument, we may assume b 1 to have a k-fold zero at the origin. The rest of the argument is routine. <p> Finally, a remark concerning the proofs of the main results. Theorem 3.2 and its corollary follow as a strikingly simple consequence of the general theory of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. A totally different (and somewhat tricky) argument is employed in the proofs of Theorems 1.8 and 3.9; that latter argument leads to further consequences which will be discussed elsewhere. <p> The following function plays the key role in the determination of the approximation order of the stationary PSI ladder S (): (2:1) fl := (1 P ) 1=2 : In this definition, 0=0 := 0. The basic observation of <ref> [BDR1] </ref> is the following: (2.2) Theorem 2.20 of [BDR1]. Let f be a function whose Fourier transform is supported in the cube C=h, C := [ : : ] d . Let 2 L 2 . <p> The following function plays the key role in the determination of the approximation order of the stationary PSI ladder S (): (2:1) fl := (1 P ) 1=2 : In this definition, 0=0 := 0. The basic observation of <ref> [BDR1] </ref> is the following: (2.2) Theorem 2.20 of [BDR1]. Let f be a function whose Fourier transform is supported in the cube C=h, C := [ : : ] d . Let 2 L 2 . <p> Let 2 L 2 . Then, dist (f; h S ()) = (2) d=2 kfl (h) b f k L 2 (C=h) : Whenever b f is not supported on C=h, <ref> [BDR1] </ref> splits f into f 1 + f 2 , with b f 1 coinciding with b f on B=h, B C, and is zero elsewhere. This leads (almost immediately) to the following estimates: Corollary 2.3. <p> From that, the following characterization is provided in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>: 10 (2.4) Theorem 1.6 of [BDR1]. <p> From that, the following characterization is provided in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>: 10 (2.4) Theorem 1.6 of [BDR1]. <p> Under some favorable conditions on the generator , one is able to derive from the last characterization simpler ones. One such simplification in contained in the following statement. (2.6) Corollary 5.15 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. Assume that satisfies assumption (c) of Corollary 1.12.

(2.4)) implies that S provides approximation order k to all the functions in W k 2 . 3. Core Let S be an SI space. <p> following condition holds: "there exists a function f 2 W k1 2 n0 such that, for some sequence (h i ) i that decreases to zero, dist (f; S h ) = o (h k1 ); h = h 1 ; h 2 ; ::: 00 In the language of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, the satisfaction of Property H (k) implies that S provides approximation order k to all reasonably smooth functions as soon as it provides a density order k 1 to a single smooth non-zero function. <p> S 1=n = S h : Thus, instead of proving (3.5), we are entitled to prove that, for some 2 S 1=n , (3:6) dist (f 1 ; u S ()) constkf k L 2 e (n): However, b f 1 is supported on B=u, and therefore Theorem 2.20 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref> (cf. (2.2)) provides us with an explicit formula dist (f 1 ; u S ()) = constkfl (u) b f 1 k L 2 (B=u) ; with fl defined as in (2.1). <p> Theorem 2.14 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref> then entails that any L 2 -function whose Fourier transform is of the form b = t b is in 1=n S ( ) S 1=n , provided that t is 2n-periodic. We take t to be the 2n-periodization of the support function of B, and define accordingly. <p> We proceed now with the proof of the theorem. Since, as contended, all derivatives of fl of orders &lt; k vanish at the origin, we see that fl = O (j j k ); around the origin. Hence Theorem 1.6 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref> (cf. (2.4)) implies that S () provides approximation order k to W k 2 . Proof of Proposition 4.2.

Reference-contexts: We note that the above C k1 -assumption on appears to be too restrictive. For example, refinable polynomial B-splines as well as refinable polynomial box splines that are not in C k1 (but are in C k2 ) provide approximation order k (cf. <ref> [BHR] </ref> for details). In any event, both results are restricted to PSI spaces, and impose fast decay rates on the generator , together with some kind of stability assumption on its shifts. (We have not defined the notions of L 2 -stability or the uniform convergence of subdivision schemes. <p> Second, can be shown to lie in W s 2 , for any s &lt; k 1=2. The situation for box splines (cf. <ref> [BHR] </ref> for definition and details) is similar. In contrast, neither Result 1.4, nor Result 1.5 fully recover the approximation order of box splines: the former applies only to box splines whose shifts are L 2 -stable, the latter provides an estimate which is 1 less than the exact order. <p> Such presentation stems from the typical problem in Spline Theory, where smoothness is a more readily available property than the approximation orders (cf. <ref> [BHR] </ref>). However, for more general refinable functions, the readily available information (viz., the mask) may appear to be more adequate for computing approximation orders than estimating either the smoothness, say, of 2 or the decay of its Fourier transform.
