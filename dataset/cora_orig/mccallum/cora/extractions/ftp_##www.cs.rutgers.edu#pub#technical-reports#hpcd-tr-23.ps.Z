Abstract: Numerical simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) plays a crucial role in predicting the behavior of physical systems and in modern engineering design. However, in order to produce reliable results with a PDE simulator, a human expert must typically expend considerable time and effort in setting up the simulation. Most of this effort is spent in generating the grid, the discretization of the spatial domain which the PDE simulator requires as input. To properly design a grid, the gridder must not only consider the characteristics of the spatial domain, but also the physics of the situation and the peculiarities of the numerical simulator. This paper describes an intelligent gridder that is capable of analyzing the topology of the spatial domain and predicting approximate physical behaviors based on the geometry of the spatial domain to automatically generate grids for computational fluid dynamics simulators. Typically gridding programs are given a partitioning of the spatial domain to assist the gridder. Our gridder is capable of performing this partitioning. This enables the grid-der to automatically grid spatial domains of arbitrary configurations.

Reference-contexts: In the 2D planar flow domain, Dannenhoffer's program is able to do partitioning by merging templates of previously-solved cases. So, the set of shapes it can handle is limited. Santhanam identifies several key parameters to modify and improve grids in 1D Euler domain. <ref> (Gelsey 1994) </ref> describes automated setup of numerical simulations involving ordinary differential equations. Conclusion Numerical simulation of partial differential equations is a powerful tool for engineering design. However, human expertise and spatial reasoning abilities are needed in order to form the spatial grids which PDE solvers require as input.

Reference-contexts: Generating a proper grid involves reason ing about the geometry of the regions of interest, the physics of the situation and the peculiarities of the numerical analysis code. To deal with the complexities of gridding, the current trend in the gridding field is toward interactive gridding <ref> (Remotique, Hart, & Stokes 1992, Kao & Su 1992) </ref>. Interactive gridding more readily taps into the spatial reasoning abilities of the human user through the use of a graphical interface with a mouse. However, this approach is not acceptable for automated design systems.

Reference-contexts: We believe our methodology of identifying key physical features of the domain and of reasoning about how they interact with the geometry is quite general and extensible. For example, in the ingot casting problem of heat transfer the temperature profile seems to be the key feature <ref> (Ling, Steinberg, & Jaluria 1993) </ref>. Temperature profiles tend to change the fastest near sharp corners and in appendages (regions where the surface area to volume ratio is large). This suggests that isotherms should be useful as grid lines, and they should be distributed more densely near corners and appendages.

Reference-contexts: He is expected to do the partitioning by either writing batch commands, or more recently by using an interactive graphical interface. In either case, the partitions created only apply to the one particular problem at hand. More recently, <ref> (Schuster 1992) </ref> has been trying to revive batch mode gridding by writing more general batch commands. However, his program is only able to grid a small, fixed set of airplane topologies. One of the fundamental problems with the current gridding programs is that they do not make use of topology.

Reference-contexts: Difficulties of partitioning Much work has been done on the problem of automated gridding <ref> (Thompson, Warsi, & Mastin 1985) </ref>, and many gridding programs have been developed. However, most of these efforts concentrate on developing new methods of reparametrization and new distribution schemes. The choices of which reparametriza-tion method and which distribution scheme to use are usually left to the human expert.
