Title: Stuff 3D  
Author: Ilya Gildenblat, 
Note: Team 13 Final Project  
Abstract: We designed and created Stuff3D, a modeling program for kids. It provides a collection of fun modeling tools that can be applied to a virtual ball of clay, in a straightforward interface that runs in real time. The interface is meant to be intuitive enough for even a novice computer user to be able to start working with immediately, yet powerful enough to create a variety of nice effects. The program has file handling capabilities. Finally, it can export objects to the Inventor format, meaning that Stuff3D could find itself being used for much more grown-up applications.
