Title: when physical constraints guide the tool placement, this fundamentally changes the type of motor control
Keyword: Two-handed interaction, bimanual asymmetry, virtual manipulation, motor control, 3D interaction, haptics.  
Note: Furthermore,  is significant only for skilled manipulation.  
Abstract: 1 ABSTRACT We present an experiment on cooperative bimanual action. Right-handed subjects manipulated a pair of physical objects, a tool and a target object, so that the tool would touch a target on the object (fig. 1). For this task, there is a marked specialization of the hands. Performance is best when the left hand orients the target object and the right hand manipulates the tool, but is significantly reduced when these roles are reversed. This suggests that the right hand operates relative to the frame-of-reference of the left hand.

Reference-contexts: Three-dimensional virtual manipulation is a particularly promising application area. Examples include MultiGen Smart Scene [23], the Virtual Workbench [26], 3Draw [28], Worlds-in-Miniature [31], and work by Shaw [30] and Abel <ref> [1] </ref>. There is also some interest for teleoperation applications [31]. In two dimensions, examples include Toolglass [3], Fitzmaurices Graspable User Interface [8], and Leganchuks bimanual area sweeping technique [20]. Bolt [4] has investigated uses of two hands plus voice input. <p> With haptic feedback, it can be an automatic, subconscious manipulation, meaning that full visual attention can be devoted to a high-level task (such as monitoring an animation) instead of to the tool acquisition sub-task. For example, the PolyShop VR application <ref> [1] </ref> uses a physical drafting table as a support surface for 2D interactions, allowing the user to just touch the table to make selections. These issues underscore the design tension between physical and virtual manipulation.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Two-handed interaction has become an accepted technique for fish tank 3D manipulation, for immersive virtual reality, and for 2D interfaces such as ToolGlass <ref> [3] </ref>. Unfortunately, there is little formal knowledge about how the two hands combine their action to achieve a common goal. The present experiment was motivated by our experiences with the props-based interface for neurosurgical visualization [14]. <p> Buxton [6] has also prepared a summary of issues in two-handed input. Kabbash [19] studied a compound drawing and selection task, and concluded that two-handed input techniques, such as ToolGlass <ref> [3] </ref>, which mimic everyday asymmetric dependent tasks yield superior overall performance. In an asymmetric dependent task, the action of the right hand depends on that of the left hand [19][9]. This experiment did not, however, include any conditions where the action of the left hand depended on the right hand. <p> Three-dimensional virtual manipulation is a particularly promising application area. Examples include MultiGen Smart Scene [23], the Virtual Workbench [26], 3Draw [28], Worlds-in-Miniature [31], and work by Shaw [30] and Abel [1]. There is also some interest for teleoperation applications [31]. In two dimensions, examples include Toolglass <ref> [3] </ref>, Fitzmaurices Graspable User Interface [8], and Leganchuks bimanual area sweeping technique [20]. Bolt [4] has investigated uses of two hands plus voice input. Hauptmann [13] showed that people naturally use speech and two-handed gestures to express spatial manipulations.

Reference-contexts: Since the hands are not necessarily working together to achieve a common goal, we cannot be sure that these experiments apply to cooperative bimanual action. 1 There are a few notable exceptions, however. Buxton and Myers <ref> [5] </ref> demonstrated that computer users naturally use two hands to perform compound tasks (positioning and scaling, navigation and selection) and that task performance is best when both hands are used. Buxton [6] has also prepared a summary of issues in two-handed input.

Reference-contexts: Most real-world manipulative tasks utilize both the left and the right hands working. For example, writing is often considered to be a unimanual task, yet in practice the nonpreferred hand plays a distinct role to orient the page for the action of the preferred hand <ref> [9] </ref>. Interface designers have begun to realize that humans are two-handed, and it is time that we developed some formal knowledge in support of such designs. <p> Bolt [4] has investigated uses of two hands plus voice input. Hauptmann [13] showed that people naturally use speech and two-handed gestures to express spatial manipulations. Guiards Kinematic Chain Model Since our experiment was in part suggested by Guiards Kinematic Chain (KC) model <ref> [9] </ref>, a bit of background will be helpful. The kinematic chain model is a general model of skilled bimanual action, where a kinematic chain is a serial linkage of abstract motors. For example, the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers form a kinematic chain representing the arm. <p> Left hand precedence: The left hand precedes the right: for example, the left hand first positions the paper, then the right hand begins to write. This is obvious for handwriting, but also applies to tasks such as swinging a golf club <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is obvious for handwriting, but also applies to tasks such as swinging a golf club [9]. Looking beyond the hands, one might also apply the KC model to reason about multiple effector systems ranging from the hands and voice (playing a piano and singing <ref> [10] </ref>), the hands and feet (operating a cars clutch and stick shift), or the multiple fingers of the hand (grasping a pen).

Reference-contexts: This experiment did not, however, include any conditions where the action of the left hand depended on the right hand. Guiard performed tapping experiments (Fitts task) with a bimanually held rod <ref> [11] </ref>. Subjects performed the tapping task using two grips: a preferred grip (with one hand held at the end of the rod and the other hand near the middle) and a reversed grip (with the hands swapping positions).

Reference-contexts: There was a small, but significant, main effect of Sex, along with several significant interactions (table 4). Although this experiment was not designed to detect sex differences, this finding is consistent with the literature, which suggests that females may be better at some dexterity tasks <ref> [12] </ref>. Table 4: Overall Sex difference effects. To ensure that Sex is not a distorting factor, we performed separate ANOVAs with N=8 male and N=8 female subjects.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, there is little formal knowledge about how the two hands combine their action to achieve a common goal. The present experiment was motivated by our experiences with the props-based interface for neurosurgical visualization <ref> [14] </ref>. This is a 3D user interface based on the two-handed physical manipulation of hand-held tools, or props, and was designed to allow neurosurgeons to visualize volumetric medical image data. <p> Under virtual manipulation, one can overcome some of these factors (such as mass asymmetry), but not all of them. For example, many virtual manipulation tasks (such as our example task of cross-sectioning volumetric medical image data <ref> [14] </ref>) will require a specific view to do the work and will have a referential nature. H2: For the Easy task reversing roles of the hands will not have any reliable effect.

Reference-contexts: This strikes us as an especially telling finding for virtual manipulation, where the user is often equipped with a glove offering no haptic feedback, and speaks strongly for the possible benefits of using either passive or active haptic feedback (using either props <ref> [15] </ref> or a force feedback arm akin to the Phantom [29], respectively). Specialization of the roles of the hands is significant only for skilled manipulation.

Reference-contexts: In current work, we are exploring how the two hands together can help users to form a better sense of the virtual space in which they are working <ref> [16] </ref>. With two hands, users maintain a relatively precise, body-relative representation of space which is not dependent on visual feedback. The experimental data also suggest a one-way transfer of skill from 8 bimanual to unimanual control.

Reference-contexts: Limitations of the Experiment There are a couple of factors which limit the sensitivity of this experiment. First, we ideally would like to have a range of experimentally controlled difficulties analogous to the Index of Difficulty (ID) for Fitts Law <ref> [21] </ref>. But Fitts Law applies to movement of one hand, and we are not aware of any adaptations which could handle movement of both hands together. Instead, we have opted for an easy versus hard difficulty distinction. Second, our accuracy measurement yields a dichotomous pass / fail outcome.
