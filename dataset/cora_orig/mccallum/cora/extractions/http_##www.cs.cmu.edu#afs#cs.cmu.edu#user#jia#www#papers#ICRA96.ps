Abstract: In the absence of vision, grasping an object often relies on tactile feedback from the fingertips. Before force closure is formed, where on the object a fingertip touches can usually be felt from the motion of contact on the fingertip during a small amount of pushing. In this paper we investigate the first stage of such blind grasping. More specifically, we study the problem of determining the pose of a known planar object by pushing. Assuming sliding friction in the plane, a dynamic analysis of pushing results in a numerical algorithm that computes the object pose from three instantaneous contact positions on a fingertip. Simulations and experiments (with an Adept robot) have been conducted to demonstrate the sensing feasibility.

Reference-contexts: under the push, would cause the contact to move from the initial position to the intermediate position on the finger at the recorded time. 4 The 3 Random polygons were generated by taking random walks on an arrangement of a large number of random lines precomputedby a topological sweeping algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 More specifically, the algorithm guessed a number of initial contacts on the object, and called the Newton-Raphson routine. In the experiments, 10 guesses were taken for an ellipse and 3 guesses for each edge of a 5 final contact position was then used to distinguish between ambiguous poses.
