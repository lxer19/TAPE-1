Abstract: UPMAIL Technical Report No. 60 December 21, 1989 ISSN 1100-0686 Abstract We propose an architecture for building expert systems in which the main subsystems are distinct but communicating programs: a Prolog inference engine, a multimedia interface tool and a data base management system. We have used this architecture for constructing a legal expert system for labour law. We propose a novel approach for capturing vague concepts. The vagueness is not represented in the sense that its extent is quantified but instead rules are given for evaluating the concept in a given situation. The method is analogous to legal practice; lawyers develop methods for judging whether vague concepts apply to fact situations. These methods are used for identifying the relevant subquestions and legal text documents for analyzing the case in issue. Our system reflects this and other aspects of a lawyer's practical work. This paper was presented at DEXA '90, the International Conference on Data Base and Expert Systems Applications, on 29-31 August 1990 in Vienna, Austria.

Reference-contexts: As an idea hypertext has been around since the 1940's, cf. Bush [4]. Actual implementations of the hypertext idea appeared in the 1960's, cf. Engelbart [6]. Today powerful commercial systems are available, e.g., Hypercard <ref> [1] </ref>. MultiProlog While multimedia is a cutting-edge technology for man-machine communication, logic programming is powerful for developing computer reasoning systems. Our system has been 3 developed in a logic programming language that has links to a multimedia system and data bases (see figure 1) [14].

Reference-contexts: RELATED WORK There exist a variety of proposals for how to represent vague legal concepts, e.g., fuzzy logic, probability, approximation, and examples. Some of the most commonly suggested have been compared and evaluated by Bench-Capon and Sergot <ref> [3] </ref>. Their analysis resulted in a proposal quite akin to the approach developed in this paper. They propose a representation based on general rules supplemented with examples of actual or stereotypical legal cases relevant to the vague legal concept in question.

Reference-contexts: Hypertext Multimedia is a technique for communicating information that is attracting much attention today. Multimedia is a common name for communicating various kinds of information such as text or hypertext, speech, sound, graphics, etc. As an idea hypertext has been around since the 1940's, cf. Bush <ref> [4] </ref>. Actual implementations of the hypertext idea appeared in the 1960's, cf. Engelbart [6]. Today powerful commercial systems are available, e.g., Hypercard [1]. MultiProlog While multimedia is a cutting-edge technology for man-machine communication, logic programming is powerful for developing computer reasoning systems.

Reference-contexts: At the same time it must be flexible enough to express concepts that do not naturally fit into the standard framework. For the latter purpose a high-level programming language would be convenient. The logic programming language Prolog <ref> [5] </ref> fulfills both these requirements in a single level formalism. Pattern matching is available directly in the form of unification. Unlike most other proposed AI languages, Prolog can be compiled to achieve high performance.

Reference-contexts: This is not to say that representation of vagueness as such is insurmountable. Perhaps, such a representation could be carried out along lines analogous to those developed by Ham-felt and Barklund for capturing legal interpretation principles for notions such as analogia legis and e contrario <ref> [7, 8, 9] </ref>. Such a project is however much more ambitious and still there exist several questions|both of technical and philosophical nature|that ought to be investigated before commercial systems based on that approach are launched.

MOTIVATION Failure to observe proper proceedings when dismissing an employee is expensive. <p> Pattern matching is available directly in the form of unification. Unlike most other proposed AI languages, Prolog can be compiled to achieve high performance. Among the other advantages, Prolog has a potential for metaprogramming which seems essential for high-level knowledge representation <ref> [8] </ref>. Data Bases Our system is primarily intended to access remote public text data bases, containing case descriptions, etc. Since these data bases are often accessed via modems the interfaces are usually text-based. Accessing them from inside a hypertext system such as HyperCard is technically not difficult. <p> This is not to say that representation of vagueness as such is insurmountable.

Reference-contexts: The primary problem is to see whether the rule applies or not to a certain fact situation. First when this is established a mechanical application of the rule is possible. The background to the research described herein is a cooperation project with a major Swedish employer organization <ref> [10] </ref>. Activities carried out at the employer organization are primarily negotiation with the union on matters such as the interpretation of collective contracts, dismissal of employees etc. We chose to investigate the prospects of building a knowledge system for dismissal of employees.

Reference-contexts: The problem is the presence of vague legal concepts. Concepts that are more or less vague, or as it is also termed "open-textured," appear frequently in legal reasoning, see e.g., Hart <ref> [11] </ref>. Legal reasoning is not a mechanical application of rules in statutes and the like. Legal reasoning is more a process of interpreting legal rules and the concepts that form part of these rules.

Reference-contexts: The question is thus "how can we handle vague concepts?" We do not consider other approaches such fuzzy logic, probability etc appropriate where they for example give the extent of vagueness by numbers; where do these numbers come from <ref> [12] </ref>? The point of departure we have chosen is how the expert actually reasons about a vague concept.

Reference-contexts: The architecture of the system has three major components: a Prolog inference machine, a hypertext system, and a legal data base. These subsystems are connected in a network and interact with each other and the user <ref> [14] </ref>. The system is truly distributed in the sense that all subsystem can reside on distinct computers without any visible difference for the user. <p> MultiProlog While multimedia is a cutting-edge technology for man-machine communication, logic programming is powerful for developing computer reasoning systems. Our system has been 3 developed in a logic programming language that has links to a multimedia system and data bases (see figure 1) <ref> [14] </ref>. UPMAIL MultiProlog is a portable implementation of Prolog with extraordinary capabilities to coexist and interact with other applications. For this particular system we have linked it with SuperCard, a state-of-the-art hypertext system, and with Oracle, a SQL relational data base management system.
