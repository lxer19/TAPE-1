Title: Note on the path covering number of a semicomplete multipartite digraph  
Author: Gregory Gutin and Anders Yeo 
Note: 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification 05C20.  
Abstract: A digraph D is called is semicomplete c-partite if its vertex set V (D) can be partitioned into c sets (partite sets) such that for any two vertices x and y in different partite sets at least one arc between x and y is in D and there are no arcs between vertices in the same partite set. The path covering number of D is the minimum number of paths in D that are pairwise vertex disjoint and cover the vertices of D. Volkmann (1996) has proved two sufficient conditions on hamiltonian paths in semicomplete multipartite digraphs and conjectured two related sufficient conditions. In this paper, we derive sufficient conditions for a semicomplete multipartite digraph to have path covering number at most k and show that Volkmann's results and conjectures can be readily obtained from our conditions.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the underlined graph of a semicomplete multipartite digraph is a complete multipartite graph.

Clearly, pc (D) = 1 is equivalent to the existence of a hamiltonian path in D. This note is motivated by two conjectures of L.

Reference-contexts: Proof: The result follows from the fact that, by Theorem 2.1, the vertices of the cycles of a k-path-cycle factor F in M and a path of F induce the subgraph of M containing a hamiltonian path. 2 The next lemma was first proved in <ref> [13] </ref>. The original proof relies on a theorem of A.J. Hoffmann on circulations in networks.
