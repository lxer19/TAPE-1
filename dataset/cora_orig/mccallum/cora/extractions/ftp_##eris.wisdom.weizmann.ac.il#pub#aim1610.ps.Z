Abstract: Human object recognition is generally considered to tolerate changes of the stimulus position in the visual field. A number of recent studies, however, have cast doubt on the completeness of translation invariance. In a new series of experiments we tried to investigate whether positional specificity of short-term memory is a general property of visual perception. We tested same-different discrimination of computer graphics models that were displayed at the same or at different locations of the visual field, and found complete translation invariance, regardless of the similarity of the animals and irrespective of direction and size of the displacement (Exp. 1 and 2). Decisions were strongly biased towards same decisions if stimuli appeared at a constant location, while after translation subjects displayed a tendency towards different decisions. Even if the spatial order of animal limbs was randomized ("scrambled animals"), no deteriorating effect of shifts in the field of view could be detected (Exp. 3). However, if the influence of single features was reduced (Exp. 4 and 5) small but significant effects of translation could be obtained. Under conditions that do not reveal an influence of translation, rotation in depth strongly interferes with recognition (Exp. 6). Changes of stimulus size did not reduce performance (Exp. 7). Tolerance to these object transformations seems to rely on different brain mechanisms, with translation and scale invariance being achieved in principle, while rotation invariance is not. This report describes research done at the Center for Biological and Computational Learning in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Reference-contexts: This displacement effect has been shown to be gradual (i.e. larger displacements produce poorer performance), and to be specific for same trials. Control experiments rule out explanations in terms of afterimages, eye movements, and shifts of spatial attention <ref> (Dill & Fahle 1997a) </ref>. While same-different matching involves only short-term memory in the range of a few seconds, Nazir and O'Regan (1990) also found positional specificity in learning experiments that lasted at least several minutes. They trained subjects to discriminate a complex target pattern from a number of distractors. <p> The latter result is consistent with the finding that positional specificity in discrimination of random patterns is influenced by the similarity between stimuli, as mentioned above <ref> (Dill & Fahle 1997a) </ref>. 2 Experiment1: Discrimination of animal objects In our first experiment we tested positional specificity of same-different discrimination among six computer-graphics animal-like shapes (the left column in Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: For that purpose, we adapted computer graphics stimuli (cf. Figure 1) that have been used in the past to investigate the influence of rotation in depth on object recognition <ref> (Edelman 1995) </ref>. In a series of experiments, Edelman (1995) showed that changing the orientation of these 3D objects relative to the observer severely reduces their recognition rate. <p> Apparatus and Stimuli. Stimuli were produced and displayed on a Silicon Graphics workstation (19 00 color monitor; refresh rate 120 Hz). The display was viewed binocularly at a distance of 0:6 m. The stimuli were 3D computer-graphics animal-like objects, adapted from an earlier study on object recognition <ref> (Edelman 1995) </ref>. Each animal was defined by a set of 56 parameters representing characteristics such as length, diameter, and orientation of individual limbs. <p> Decisions were communicated by pressing left (for "same") or right (for "different") mouse buttons. A computer beep provided negative feedback immediately after incorrect responses. 2 The top and the bottom shapes in this figure are the original objects used in <ref> (Edelman 1995) </ref>; the others are parametric variations, courtesy of T. Sugihara, RIKEN Institute. 2 Experimental Design. <p> There was no indication of a speed-accuracy tradeoff. 2.3 Discussion In same-different experiments with complex random patterns, significant effects of translation have been found repeatedly by different experimenters (Foster & Kahn 1985; Dill & Fahle 1997a). Similarly, rotating animal objects in depth had a strong impact on performance <ref> (Edelman 1995) </ref>. We had, therefore, expected to find in Experiment 1 a clear deficit of transfer compared to control comparisons. Positional specificity, however, was only small. Only when the analysis was restricted to same trials did the effect of translation become significant.

Reference-contexts: An intriguing candidate theory, whose full consideration is beyond the scope of the present note, is the involvement of a common principle in the visual system's quest for invariance. The principle we propose is reliance on mechanisms trained for particular object classes <ref> (Edelman 1997) </ref>, operating on top of a universal preprocessing stage that provides a pedestal performance, irrespective of the object identity (Edelman et al. 1997; Riesenhuber & Poggio 1997). This proposal is related to Ullman's (1995) idea of a division of object transformations into two kinds.

Reference-contexts: The finding that lower animals such as flies do not exhibit position-invariant processing (Dill et al. 1993; Dill & Heisenberg 1995), and the difficulty of simpler neural networks such as the Perceptron to learn translation invariance <ref> (Minsky & Pappert 1969) </ref>, have cast doubt on this simplicity assumption. 1 A number of recent studies (Foster & Kahn 1985; Nazir & O'Regan 1990; Dill & Fahle 1997a; Dill & Fahle 1997b) have shown that in humans recognition of novel complex stimuli is not completely translation invariant.

Reference-contexts: The onset asynchrony of the two animal stimuli was 1:4 sec. This long interval and the employment of masks after the first and second stimuli abolish the effects of apparent motion and iconic afterimages <ref> (Phillips 1974) </ref>. For each same trial the computer randomly chose one of the six animals; in different trials two different animals were randomly selected. Successive trials were separated by a 1 sec interval. Experiment 1 comprised 3 blocks of 96 trials each.

Reference-contexts: The surface color of the animal objects was yellow, the background was dark gray and covered the entire computer screen. The stimuli were presented for only ca. 100 msec, a time too short to foveate the stimulus by a rapid saccade <ref> (Saslow 1967) </ref>. To avoid afterimages due to delayed phosphor decay, a stimulus presentation was always immediately followed by four masks. These comprised 20 random cylinders each, and were presented simultaneously at the four possible stimulus locations, for 300 msec.
