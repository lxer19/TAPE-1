Abstract: Probabilistic inference with a belief network in general is computationally expensive. Since the concept of structural relevance provides for identifying parts of a belief network that are irrelevant to a context of interest, it allows for alleviating to some extent the computational burden of inference: inference can be restricted to the network's relevant part. The structurally relevant part of a belief network, however, is not static. It may change dynamically as reasoning progresses. We address the dynamics of structural relevance and introduce the concept of an independence projection to capture these dynamics.

Reference-contexts: As applications of the belief-network framework grow larger, the networks involved increase in size accordingly. For large belief networks, probabilistic inference shows a tendency to become rather time-consuming. Since probabilistic inference is known to be NP-hard <ref> [Cooper, 1990] </ref>, this tendency may not be denied in general. In many real-life problem domains, however, reasoning with a belief network concentrates on only some variables of interest.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge of relevance to the variables of interest can be exploited to identify part of a network to which probabilistic inference can be restricted, thereby providing for a reduction of the computational burden involved. The concept of relevance can be captured in many different ways <ref> [Druzdzel & Suermondt, 1994] </ref>. One way of capturing relevance in belief networks is by structural relevance. <p> The concept of structural relevance now applies to the independences that can be read from the digraph of a belief network <ref> [Druzdzel & Suermondt, 1994] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: By exploiting the d-separation criterion and the concepts of strong and weak d-separation, any independence projection can be computed in O (n 2 ) time, where n is the number of variables in the digraph. Algorithms to this end build on a (modified) graph traversal <ref> [Geiger et al., 1990] </ref>. 7 Conclusions The concept of structural relevance provides for identifying part of a belief network that is relevant to a context of interest. We have shown that the relevant part of a belief network may change dynamically as reasoning progresses.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Complex problem domains that are fraught with uncertainty are in the focus of attention of artificial-intelligence research and have been so for some time now. One of the most promising frameworks for dealing with uncertainty that have emerged from this research is the framework of (Bayesian) belief networks <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. This framework is firmly rooted in probability theory. <p> As in this paper we will be concerned with the qualitative part of a belief network only, we will not elaborate on its quantitative part; for further information, the reader is referred to <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. We consider once more the set of arcs of the digraph of a belief network. These arcs with each other model the independences holding in the probability distribution that is represented by the network. We define the probabilistic meaning assigned to acyclic digraphs more formally. <p> Unfortunately, there are probability distributions whose independence model cannot be represented faithfully by a directed graph, that is, there are probability distributions Pr for which there does not exist a digraph G such that M G = M Pr <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. For representing a probability distribution Pr by a belief network, therefore, a digraph G is created whose independence model M G is a (maximal ) subset of the independence model M Pr of Pr.
