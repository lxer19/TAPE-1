Abstract: This paper extends the theory of trust region subproblems in two ways: (i) it allows indefinite inner products in the quadratic constraint and (ii) it uses a two sided (upper and lower bound) quadratic constraint. Characterizations of optimality are presented, which have no 0 Research supported by Natural Sciences Engineering Research Council Canada grants A4641 and A9161, respectively.

Reference-contexts: If one considers a symmetric perturbation in (1.1), then connections with the trust region problem are studied in [23] and show up in the theory of divide and conquer algorithms for symmetric eigenvalue problems; see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>. Moreover, the algorithms in [12, 21] are based on finding a Lagrange multiplier smaller than the smallest eigenvalue of B, and therefore guaranteeing positive definiteness of the Hessian of the Lagrangian. <p> Then there is only one value ^ such that (2.14) holds. Proof: Suppose that ffi 6= ^ is such that B ffiC 0. Then any convex combination of B ^ C and B ffiC is positive semidefinite. Hence B ^ C ff (ffi ^ )C 0 8ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: (2:16) Now consider the analytic function h (ff) = det [B ^ C ff (ffi ^ )C]: Then h (0) = det (B ^ C) = 0, and the assumption on the determinant implies that there exists fi 2 &lt; such that h (fi) 6= 0.

Affine scaling methods for general quadratic programming problems, which solve a trust region sub-problem at each step, are given in e.g. [15].

(See Algorithm 6.3 below.) We assume that C is nonsingular and that the regular case holds, i.e. there exits such that B C &gt; 0. In our framework, the algorithm is a primal-dual type algorithm. <p> When the gap between lower and upper bounds is small enough, the algorithm stops. Convergence of the algorithm follows immediately from the concavity of the dual function. This framework also simplifies the description of the algorithm in <ref> [21] </ref>, where the special case that C = I and 0 &lt; ff is treated. (fi can be set to any negative number.) Note that in this case, feasibility of x is a necessary condition of the hard case and is used as an indicator that the hard case might have <p> However, only in this case do we get the added improvement in the upper bound. A log barrier penalty function can to added to avoid the large step. Thus it appears that the hard case might actually be preferable. Many of the statements and results are straightforward extensions from <ref> [21] </ref> and we include some of them for completeness. We include results involving our dual function (see (5.9)) h () = ff t (B C) y ; if &lt; 0 and we discuss some of the advantages that occur by using this dual. <p> or ( = 0 and fl &lt; ff), If fifl &gt; 0, let = (jflj 1 p jfij) p jfij fl If fifl 0, let = (fl fi) 1 2q t q : If C is positive definite, then ff is positive and this algorithm reduces to that presented in <ref> [21] </ref>. Note that the algorithm stops if = 0. However, this is not a failure, since this indicates that we have solved the dual problem if we solve an eigenvalue problem, e.g. if ff fi &gt; 0 we need to solve sup BC&gt;0 . <p> We have therefore found the optimal value of the primal problem. The following lemma is a generalization of Lemma 3.4 in <ref> [21] </ref>. We have modified the results and added comments to include the role of our dual function. We include the proof for completeness.

In case = 0 (no linear term) the stationary points of the trust region subproblem correspond to the eigenvalues of B. In <ref> [26] </ref>, the authors related stationarity properties of ( ~ P ) to spectral properties of the parametric border perturbation of B given by A (t) = B ! Hence, the above perturbation of B has, as an analog, the perturbation 4 of the purely quadratic function y t By by the <p> Remark 3.2 If one analyzes the function g T () in the special case where n a = 0, additional graphical properties may be obtained. In particular, one can exploit the fact that g 000 T () &lt; 0 at every nonsingular point ; see <ref> [26] </ref> for the details. We now can give the following existence and uniqueness result for the easy case. It includes a necessary and sufficient condition for the simultane ous existence of a maximizing point and a minimizing point for (P ). <p> A variant of this result can be found in [10]; see also <ref> [26] </ref>. The proof is by direct substitution, and is omitted. Lemma 3.2 Let the hypotheses of lemma 3.1 hold, and let 2 fl.

Reference-contexts: Other numerical algorithms are presented in [12, 14, 11]. Recently, the trust region subprob-lem, with the additional linear constraint Ax = b, has been employed as the basic step in the affine scaling variation of interior point methods for solving linear programming problems, see e.g. <ref> [7, 2, 29] </ref>. Affine scaling methods for general quadratic programming problems, which solve a trust region sub-problem at each step, are given in e.g. [15]. In addition, many continuous relaxations of discrete optimization problems result in norm constraints and therefore trust region subproblems arise, see e.g. [18] for a survey.
