Abstract: Two sets of fundamental properties which a spatial representation should describe are the position, extent, and orientation of objects, and topological and directional relations between objects. In previous approaches, the formalization of a particular property, such as topological spatial relations, has often been studied as an independent problem. The resulting theories have been elegant and compact, but may be difficult to use because of the assumptions on available knowledge. For example, several formalizations of topological relations assume knowledge of the boundaries of objects. Yet, knowledge of exact boundaries requires the knowledge of exact shapes, a property which is very difficult to describe symbolically. Our approach was to first define an application, a magnetic fields problem solver capable of doing both spatial and dynamic reasoning, and a broad collection of qualitative problems to be solved before embarking on the task of defining a spatial representation. The nature of the solutions to the various problems provided clues on what spatial properties were of fundamental importance, and what information could be abstracted. We describe an adequacy criterion for abstractions of object shapes, and present a description of the spatial position and orientation of objects based on extremal points. We show that topological and directional relations may be readily described in terms of this object representation. Our spatial representation is compatible with existing tools for the qualitative simulation of dynamic systems, which allows us to reason about changes in spatial relations due to the translational and rotational motion of objects.

Reference-contexts: These definitions are implemented as model fragments for the qualitative process compiler (QPC) <ref> [Crawford, et. al. 90] </ref>. QPC model libraries may be constructed in a modular fashion. Therefore, new spatial relations may be defined and included in the library as required. We have used such formalizations of those of Cui, Cohn, and Randell [1992] to build our library of spatial relations.

Reference-contexts: Some of these include descriptions of how the topological relationship between two objects may change over time due to motion or changes in size or shape <ref> [Cui, et. al. 92, Egen-hofer and Al-Taha 92] </ref>. Formalizations of directional relations, such as right-of, have been given in terms of global, intrinsic, and deictic frames of reference [Retz-Schmidt 88, Mukerjee and Joe 90]. <p> For three dimensional objects, bounding cubes and bounding spheres can be defined in a similar manner using two additional extremal points the frontmost and rearmost points. While other abstractions of shape, such as the convex hull <ref> [Cui, et. al. 92] </ref> may provide tighter bounds, they may require numerically precise data to compute and maintain.

Reference-contexts: Our implementation architecture will also permit us to inherit any advances in the underlying systems, QPC and QSIM, such as the ability to incorporate incomplete quantitative information into the models <ref> [Kay and Kuipers 93] </ref>. 2 A Spatial Representation Based on Extremal Points Figures 1 and 2 illustrate two of the magnetic fields problems we address. In the first, there is a conducting object which is rolling along a block into a magnetic field.

Reference-contexts: Our spatial representation readily fits existing methods for the qualitative simulation of dynamic systems. We have implemented descriptions of spatial relations as model fragments for the qualitative process compiler, or QPC [Craw-ford, et. al. 90], which in turn uses the QSIM qualitative simulation system <ref> [Kuipers 86] </ref>. We also include a library of processes which can modify the spatial state, such as the motion of objects.

Reference-contexts: In robot exploration <ref> [Kuipers and Levitt 88] </ref>, a fundamental goal is to learn a map of large scale space given only sensory inputs for the local space. A GIS may be provided with a map. However, both may share the goal of using an underlying map (spatial representation) for route planning and navigation. <p> We feel that the choice of the abstraction method for shapes is fundamental. The chosen method can affect the way in which spatial relations are expressed, which in turn may affect the reasoning power of the application system. For example, Kuipers <ref> [Kuipers and Levitt 88] </ref> represents distinctive places as points and connections between them as lines.

Reference-contexts: Formalizations of directional relations, such as right-of, have been given in terms of global, intrinsic, and deictic frames of reference <ref> [Retz-Schmidt 88, Mukerjee and Joe 90] </ref>. Interestingly, although the formalizations are often qualitative, an actual reasoning system may require a fair amount of precise metric information to use the definitions.

Reference-contexts: QPC performs of the task of determining the current spatial state, determines what dynamic changes are taking place, and detects significant changes in the qualitative spatial state as they occur.

Reference-contexts: This additional domain knowledge provides the means to match object descriptions in the diagram to object references in text. The methods for integrating the information in the diagram and text input into a single knowledge base are described separately <ref> [Rajagopalan and Kuipers 93b] </ref>. For the problem in Figure 1, as the conducting loop enters and exits the field, the area of overlap between the two will change. This causes an induced emf which in turn causes a current flow in the loop.
