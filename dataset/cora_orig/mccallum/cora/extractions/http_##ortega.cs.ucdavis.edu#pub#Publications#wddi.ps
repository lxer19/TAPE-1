Abstract: A fiber optic ring network, such as Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), can be operated over multiple wavelengths on its existing fiber plant consisting of point-to-point fiber links. Using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology, FDDI nodes can be partitioned to operate over multiple sub-networks, with each subnetwork operating independently on a different wavelength, and inter-subnetwork traffic forwarding performed by a bridge. For this multi-wavelength version of FDDI, which we refer to as Wavelength Distributed Data Interface (WDDI), we examine the necessary upgrades to the architecture of a FDDI node, including its possibility to serve as a bridge. The main motivation behind this study is that, as network traffic scales beyond (the single-wavelength) FDDI's information-carrying capacity, its multi-wavelength version, WDDI, can gracefully accommodate such traffic growth. A number of design choices exist in constructing a good WDDI network. Specifically, we investigate algorithms using which, based on prevailing traffic conditions, partitioning of nodes into subnetworks can be performed in an optimized fashion. Our algorithms partition the nodes into subrings, such that the total traffic flow in the network and/or the network-wide average packet delay is minimized.

Reference-contexts: Systemwide, therefore, each of the two counter-rotating rings of FDDI can be represented via W logical subrings. We refer to this multiple-wavelength version of FDDI as Wavelength Distributed Data Interface (WDDI) <ref> [8] </ref>. In the sequel, we consider only one of the physical rings since the other ring direction in FDDI is activated only during reconfiguration.

Reference-contexts: If this node has both its transmitter and receiver tuned to the same wavelength k, then it will let all of the other wavelengths pass through its interface untouched. For wavelength k, this node will act like an add-drop multiplexer <ref> [9] </ref>, as in any ring protocol. Such an interface could be implemented in several ways, with one possibility being to employ a channel-dropping filter. <p> Unfortunately, this also leads to a large search space for optimization, and we dont consider it any further. 5 A node performs wavelength conversion when it receives on one wavelength and transmits on another wavelength. 3 adopted for creating SONET self-healing ring networks <ref> [9] </ref>.) The bridge should also be equipped with memory to buffer any packets that need to be forwarded by it from one subring to the others. We assume that the bridge maintains a separate queue for each subring, to prevent head-of-the-line blocking. 6. <p> Similarly, one may create multiple subnetworks operating with their own partitions and bridges, but otherwise isolated from one another. In general, the rates on different WDM rings may be different. 10.

Reference-contexts: Previous work on WDM ring networks: In [9], a new architecture is proposed for implementing unidirectional and bi-directional 6 self-healing ring networks 7 using WDM technology. The architecture of this network, which is a WDM-based upgrade of a conventional uni-directional self-healing ring utilizing SONET add-drop multiplexers <ref> [10] </ref>, consists of N nodes generating traffic flows, and these traffic flows are directed to a single hub node (which is essentially like our bridge node). Each of the N non-bridge nodes is assigned a unique wavelength for transmission to, and reception from the hub node.

Reference-contexts: Proof: Any partition into W groups of nodes in G determines a W-cut of G. The traffic across the bridge is the weight of the W-cut and therefore the Lemma follows. The problem of finding a minimum-weight W-cut, given arbitrary W, is NP-Complete <ref> [14] </ref>. From the above observation, therefore, we examine algorithms for finding the minimum weight W-cut of a (traffic) weighted graph G. To partition the nodes into two groups using the MIN-CROSS criterion, we can use standard maximum-flow-finding algorithms to locate the minimum 2-cut [15]. <p> When the number of partitions W is greater than two, we can still perform the partitioning in polynomial time using a O (N W 2 ) algorithm <ref> [14] </ref>. However, this algorithm is exponential in W, and is described below [14]. 1.

The network has N nodes, each of which has an infinite input packet buffer. The nodes are numbered 1, 2,..., N . The packet arrival at any node s is assumed to be Poisson with rate s . <p> A subring is stable if every non-bridge node on the subring is stable. A node on a subring is stable if it receives at most one new packet arrival between two visits of the free token, on the average. From the above reasoning <ref> [16] </ref>, we find that Subring j is stable if the following conditions hold: s d2S j X min ( s ; d )b + min ( s ; fl (j) )b &lt; 1 (3) where s 2 S j , and fl (j) d2S j X min (fl (j) ; d <p> The expressions for E [W s ] and E [W 0j ] may be found in <ref> [16] </ref>.
