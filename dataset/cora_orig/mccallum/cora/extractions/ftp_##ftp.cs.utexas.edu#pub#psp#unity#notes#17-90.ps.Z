Reference-contexts: It is then true that p 7! q in F [] G if p 7! q in F ; this is, in fact, a special case of the superposition theorem <ref> [1] </ref>. However, this is a stringent restriction on G. We propose a rule whose moral is "progress is achieved when everyone pushes in the same direction." The proposed rule is obtained by simplifying and generalizing a result due to Ambuj Singh [2].

Reference-contexts: However, this is a stringent restriction on G. We propose a rule whose moral is "progress is achieved when everyone pushes in the same direction." The proposed rule is obtained by simplifying and generalizing a result due to Ambuj Singh <ref> [2] </ref>. The inference rule, given below, tells us when p 7! q in F [] G can be established from p 7! q in F . The condition is that both F and G should only "decrease" the values of their shared variables along a well-founded ordering.
