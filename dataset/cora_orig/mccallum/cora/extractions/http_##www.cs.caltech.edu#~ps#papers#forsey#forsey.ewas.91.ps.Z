Title: Character Animation using Hierarchical B-splines  
Abstract: David R. Forsey The challenge of building and animating computer generated human and animal figures is complicated by the need to smoothly and realistically control the deformation of the surface around the articulations of the underlying skeleton. This paper reviews approaches to surface modelling for character animation and describes a geometric (as apposed to physically-based) approach to character modelling using an extension to the hierarchical B-spline. This techinique provides differential attachment of the surface to the skeleton and allows multi-resolution control of surface deformation during animation. The attachment mechanism is simple, easy to use, inexpensive, extensible and can drastically reduce the effort required to animate a surface. The techniques introduced are illustrated using examples of human and animal forms.

Reference-contexts: The motion can be recovered from video images or the model can be driven directly by ``waldos'' that record body motion directly.2324]. An intriguing extension of this technique uses images (motion) to drive the shape of the animated figure This paper describes an extension to the hierarchical B-spline <ref> [8] </ref> where a hierarchical surface is attached to an underlying skeleton in such a way that the animator has control over the location and scope of the surface deformation. <p> These features combine to make animating surfaces for character animation faster and easier to do. - 5 - 2. Character Modelling with traditional spline surfaces This section reviews and extends the concept of a hierarchical spline surface. <ref> [8] </ref> A familiarity with tensor-product spline surfaces [25] is assumed. Two complications, relating to knot insertion, appear when using tensor-product spline surfaces (such a B-splines) for free-form surface design.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the cheapest and most widespread is the interpolation method where a number of separate surface models are created, each representing a different pose (or facial expression) of the figure. The surface is animated by interpolating between a pair of models. <ref> [11] </ref>. The sheer number of points and poses involved make surface animation through shape interpolation a tedious process, encouraging the development of methods that automatically modify the vertices as the joint changes angle.

Reference-contexts: Current research in animation, whether it be on dynamics, kinematics, free-form deformations or motion control, is rooted in the need to handle this ``DOF problem'' <ref> [12] </ref>. Computer representations for surfaces are varied, but typically are based upon polygons, splines, or implicit surface formulations. As animators strive for more realism, the demands placed upon the surface representation rapidly increase, particularly in those regions around the face and surrounding the joints.

Reference-contexts: Thalmann [1213] uses a procedural model called a joint-dependent local deformation (JLD) whereby the polygons around the joints of the hand are modified to maintain a realistic appearance. Each JLD is specific to a particular type of joint and is non-trivial to construct. Chadwick <ref> [14] </ref> combines a multi-vertex editing technique called free-form deformations (FFD) [15] with a procedural model in the Critter system where the user interacts with the control vertices of a deformation lattice instead of the polygonal model to change the general shape of the polygons as the joint angle changes. <p> Simple dymanic systems, such as Chadwick's <ref> [14] </ref> add dynamic behaviour to surface models through the deformation lattice by assigning point masses as the control vertices of the lattice and interconnecting everything with springs. When the system is accelerated the point masses react and the lattice itself is altered thereby changing the shape of the body model.

For example, Figure 9 illustrates how a 2D free-form deformation might operate on a shape similar to that in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Chadwick employs a procedural model, similar to the one used by Komatsu <ref> [16] </ref> for a Bezier-based body model, where particular nodes in the deformation lattice are associated with the bisection of the joint angle and where inter-penetration of the lattice is prevented.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, Pacific Data Images uses a system of interconnected deformation lattices in their animation system to compensate for this behaviour of FFD's in their animation Locomotion. <ref> [17] </ref>.

A fine mesh of patches provides the surface definition while broad-scale changes are accomplished by embedding the control vertices of the model in a coarser spline mesh.

Reference-contexts: One solution, of course, is to increase the complexity of the simulation, using stiffer springs with better damping within a more highly interconnected lattice <ref> [22] </ref> interacting with a model of the underlying bone and musculature. This is perhaps overkill for most character animation, though with the recent advances in both processor speed and algorithms for elastic deformations, this approach will most certainly grow in use.

Reference-contexts: This is perhaps overkill for most character animation, though with the recent advances in both processor speed and algorithms for elastic deformations, this approach will most certainly grow in use. Pacific Data Images' approach to the problem was to simplify it. In their Goop system <ref> [23] </ref> a point mass with spring/damper is attached to every polygon vertex in the model. As the system is subjected to acceleration, the mass moves away from its rest position. This new position is used as the polygon vertex for during rendering.

Two complications, relating to knot insertion, appear when using tensor-product spline surfaces (such a B-splines) for free-form surface design.

Reference-contexts: See <ref> [26] </ref>) For example, the relatively simple surface in Figure Worst requires 1024 control vertices. b) Because of the local support property of the basis functions, knot insertion affects how the designer is able to change the shape of the surface in the region where the knot was added.

Reference-contexts: Thus when the transformations connecting the local coordinate systems together are changed, the figure changes its position and pose <ref> [29] </ref>. Because the limbs are defined separately, if nothing if done to modify the shape, the separate surfaces will simply inter-penetrate. This behaviour is satisfactory for many applications, but not for realistic human figures where the surface must seamlessly span the joints.
