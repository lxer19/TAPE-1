Title: A note on the Pumping Lemma for regular languages different versions of the pumping lemma
Author: Cai, Jin-Yi 
Note: There are  xyz such that jxyj l, jyj &gt; 0 and v 1 xy i zv 2 2 L; 8i 0: If L is regular, then it satisfies all the three versions of the pumping lemma. Of course, Version III implies Version II and Version II implies Version I.

Abstract: We discuss the non-sufficency of pumping lemma for regularity of languages. During recent lectures to CS396 several pumping lemmas of varying strengths were discussed. This note discusses the necessity but non-sufficiency of these lemmas for regularity. See [1] for details.
