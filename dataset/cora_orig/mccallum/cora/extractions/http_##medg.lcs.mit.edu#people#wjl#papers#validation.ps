Abstract: This paper discusses the issues involved in validating a large medical knowledge base for diagnostic reasoning using a pseudo-Bayesian network of physiologic causal relations, based on our on-going experience in validating the Heart Failure Program. Validation is addressed at two levels, 1) methods for determining the extent, topology, and probabilities in the network and 2) methods for assessing, comparing, and learning from the diagnoses produced by the program. The local validation of the knowledge base requires the developer to face the issues of the boundaries of the domain, both in coverage and detail, versus the purposes of the program. The validation of the topology includes issues of imposing causal structure on everything from associations to feedback relations and determining what level of granularity captures clinical relevance. The probabilities require the use of clinical expertise checked against the literature and the available statistical data. Validation at the level of the diagnoses produced by the program involves another set of issues. Program diagnoses have a very different character than expert diagnoses. Program diagnoses are very detailed and contain a small number of completely specified hypotheses. Expert diagnoses include intentional ambiguity and only specify the primary aspects of the problem. To compare such differing diagnoses, we have developed a program that assesses whether the program diagnosis is consistent with the expert diagnosis. It is still necessary to validate the form of presentation used by the program, since these are important justifications of the diagnosis that are not usually conveyed by the expert diagnosis.
