Title: An Abstract Approach to Music

Abstract: The notion of formalized music implies that a musical composition can be described in mathematical terms. In this article we explore some formal aspects of music and propose a framework for an abstract approach. In his fundamental treatise on Formalized Music [1], Iannis Xenakis shows how a musical composition can be structured on the basis of mathematical ideas. His sieves are essentially implementations of set- and group-theoretical concepts, which can give structural coherence to a musical composition; his stochastic music is based entirely on notions of probability theory; and the idea of a composition as a book of screens points to an interesting connection with the branch of mathematics known as analysis. Many compositions based on these ideas, by Xenakis as well as others, testify to the validity of a formal approach to music. The notion of formalized music implies that a musical composition can be described in mathematical terms. In its most extreme form, formalized music is an algorithm|a description of a musical composition as a sequence of steps in a computational procedure. The composer creates the algorithm, and the performer renders the algorithm into aural events. Since computers understand only formal languages, computer music is necessarily formalized music. Our purpose in this article is to create an abstract framework that enables an algorithmic approach to music. We do not give an algorithmic approach per se, and many details have yet to be filled in, but we have at least the beginning of an abstract framework. The article consists of three parts: Section 1 presents basic concepts and terms, Section 2 the formal framework, and Section 3 a summary and conclusions.

Reference-contexts: A static drone is still a dynamic event, although there is no change in the aural perception over time. From this perspective, the phrase "The evolution is nil" <ref> [1, Chapter II, p. 50] </ref> does not make sense. 1.2 Partials, Sounds, and Compositions The first concern in a formalization of music must be the objects that constitute a musical composition. As Western musicians, we are trained to think of music in terms of the notated score. <p> Thus, a trajectory in the space of aural events can be related to an instantiation of a two-person game as realized in a duel. Remarkably, this idea was anticipated by Xenakis and implemented in his composition Duel <ref> [1, Chapter IV, p. 113] </ref>. 1.3 Cultural Influences The definition of an object such as a composition or a sound needs to be sufficiently abstract and, we claim, free of stylistic constraints. Can we infer its attributes from a score? Consider the case of a sound. <p> Remark. The idea of a musical composition as a mapping from the time domain into sound space is closely related to the concept of a musical composition as a book of screens, an idea first proposed by Xenakis <ref> [1, Chapter II, p. 50] </ref>. Unlike Xenakis, however, we view time as an independent variable, not as another degree of freedom in sound space. In Xenakis's terminology [1, Chapter VI, p. 159], temporal structure is independent of structure outside-time and structure in-time. <p> Unlike Xenakis, however, we view time as an independent variable, not as another degree of freedom in sound space. In Xenakis's terminology <ref> [1, Chapter VI, p. 159] </ref>, temporal structure is independent of structure outside-time and structure in-time. We return to this point in Section 2.2. 2 Formal Structure We now formalize some of the concepts discussed in the preceding section. <p> First, a few remarks about time. Xenakis observes that musical analysis and construction may be based on three concepts: structure outside-time, temporal structure, and structure in-time; see <ref> [1, Chapter VI, p. 159] </ref>. We claim that these concepts can be given a more precise meaning in the present context. Recall that we have identified a musical composition with a complex audio wave. The wave is represented by the symbol W and defined in Equation (1).
