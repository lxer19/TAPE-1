Abstract: As we enter the DUV lithography generation, the developmental phase of the photolithography process is becoming crucial due to the high costs associated with the lithography equipment. Improvements in the modeling of chemically amplified resists are necessary to extract the maximum possible information from the minimum amount of experimentation. The poor mans dissolution rate monitor (drm) method has been used successfully to extract the post exposure bake (PEB) and develop rate parameters for conventional I-line photoresists and some DUV chemically amplified photoresists (CARs). However, the original method suffers from some drawbacks such as locally optimized results due to the highly non-linear nature of the Mack development model and the need for visual inspection to detect convergence of the rate data. This paper used a simulated annealing optimization engine for global optimization and uses the deprotection induced thickness loss phenomenon for the conversion of dose to m. Post-exposure bake and develop rate parameters have been extracted for Shipleys UV-5 DUV photoresist.

Reference-contexts: The need for good modeling capabilities is especially true for chemically amplified resists. CARs are very sensitive to tool set (stepper, track, etc.) and hence an ideal calibration procedure would entail in-situ measurement techniques at each processing step <ref> [1] </ref>. This technique would analytically determine chemical, physical and kinetic quantities relevant to the resist system and processing conditions. Previous work with in-situ sensors for the lithography sequence by the authors have led to the development of a soft sensor that can be used in this context [2].

Reference-contexts: This technique would analytically determine chemical, physical and kinetic quantities relevant to the resist system and processing conditions. Previous work with in-situ sensors for the lithography sequence by the authors have led to the development of a soft sensor that can be used in this context <ref> [2] </ref>. A soft or virtual sensor is one that monitors features that may correlate with that wafer parameter, but only indirectly. The basic assumption made in the Poor Mans DRM methodology is that the resist develop rate depends only on the final depro-tection extent and not on the processing path. <p> However, in this technique, we use a soft sensor to determine the normalized concentration of unreacted sites by an indirect measurement of the deprotection. A brief introduction to this sensor is given next and the reader is referred to <ref> [2] </ref> for a more complete description. During the deprotection step, the side chains are very volatile in many chemically amplified photoresists and evaporate during the bake, causing film shrinkage in the exposed areas [5].

Reference-contexts: In the quenching stage, the acid ions are slowly quenched by anything more basic than the acid, such as the additives and the by-products of the reaction. In short, the t-BOC blocked polymer undergoes acidolysis to generate the soluble hydroxyl group in the presence of acid and heat <ref> [4] </ref>. The conventional modeling of the PEB process is given in Equation 3. (3) where m is the normalized concentration of unreacted blocking sites, k amp is the acid amplification factor and k loss is the acid loss factor. Both these factors are modeled using a temperature dependent Arrhenius relationship.

Reference-contexts: A brief introduction to this sensor is given next and the reader is referred to [2] for a more complete description. During the deprotection step, the side chains are very volatile in many chemically amplified photoresists and evaporate during the bake, causing film shrinkage in the exposed areas <ref> [5] </ref>. The extent of this exposed photoresist thinning is dependent on the molecular weight of the blocking groups.

Reference-contexts: Hence, there is a one to one correspondence between the applied dose and m. This provides us with a more direct method to determine m. 2.3 DEVELOP The standard Mack develop rate model has been chosen to model the develop step <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Due to the highly non-linear nature of Equation 6, traditional optimization techniques might get trapped at local solutions. To overcome this problem, we use Simulated Annealing (SA) which is a probabilistic optimization technique well suited to multi-modal, discrete, non-linear and non-differentiable functions <ref> [7] </ref>. SAs main strength is its statistical guarantee of global minimization, even in the presence of many local minima. We also used a commercial traditional optimization package to compare the results. We observed that different starting values gave widely varying results.

Reference-contexts: We plan on repeating this experiment at different PEB conditions and extracting this vital information for simulation engines such as Prolith <ref> [8] </ref>. This optimization problem [Equation 3] had 2 unknowns viz. k amp and k loss . The value of C was chosen as that given by the resist manufacturer.
