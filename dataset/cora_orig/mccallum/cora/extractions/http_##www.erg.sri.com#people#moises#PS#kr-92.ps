Abstract: We describe a ranked-model semantics for if-then rules admitting exceptions, which provides a coherent framework for many facets of evidential and causal reasoning. Rule priorities are automatically extracted form the knowledge base to facilitate the construction and retraction of plausible beliefs. To represent causation, the formalism incorporates the principle of Markov shielding which imposes a stratified set of independence constraints on rankings of interpretations. We show how this formalism resolves some classical problems associated with specificity, prediction and abduction, and how it offers a natural way of unifying belief revision, belief update, and reasoning about actions.

Reference-contexts: In the last part of this paper (Section 4) we demonstrate how rank-based systems can embody and unify the theories of belief revision <ref> [1] </ref> and belief updating [21], two theories of belief change that have been developed independently of research in default and causal reasoning. <p> We show that system-Z + offers a natural embodiment of the principles of belief revision as formulated by Al-chourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) <ref> [1] </ref>, with the additional features of enabling the absorption of new conditional sentences and the verification of coun-terfactual sentences and nested conditionals. <p> capability of system-Z + to belief revision and then use stratified ranking and its representation of actions and causal relations to govern the dynamics of belief update. 4.1 Belief revision AGM have advanced a set of postulates that have become a standard against which proposals for belief revision are tested <ref> [1] </ref>. The AGM postulates model epis-temic states as deductively closed sets of (believed) sentences and characterize how a rational agent should change its epistemic states when new beliefs are added, subtracted, or changed.

Reference-contexts: Although several remedies were proposed for the YSP within conventional nonmonotonic formalisms <ref> [35, 13, 37, 2, 24] </ref>, the formalism we explore in this paper seeks to uncover remedies systematically from basic probabilistic principles [29, pp. 509-516].

Reference-contexts: Although the AGM postulates do not provide a calculus with which one can realize the revision process or even specify the content of an epistemic state <ref> [3, 10, 27] </ref>, they nevertheless imply that a rational revision must behave as though propositions were ordered on some scale. Spohn [36] has shown how belief revision conforming to the AGM postulates can be embodied in the context of ranking functions. <p> Nebel has shown that such a strategy, can satisfy almost all the AGM axioms. Boutilier <ref> [3] </ref> has further shown that, indeed, the priority function Z + corresponds naturally to the epis temic entrenchment ordering of the AGM theory. 15 Unfortunately, even Nebel's theory does not completely succeed at formalizing the practice of belief revision, as it does not specify how the priority order on the base <p> b) then (c ! d)" is interpreted as "If I add the default a ! b to , then the conditional c ! d will be satisfied by the conse quence relation j 0 ~ of the resulting knowledge base 0 = [ fa ! bg". 15 The proof in <ref> [3] </ref> considers the priorities Z + resulting from a flat set of rules as in system-Z [31].

Reference-contexts: The basic idea in these syntax-based systems is to define a (total) priority order on the set of base propositions and to select revisions to be maximally consistent relative to that order as exemplified in the nonmonotonic systems of Brewka <ref> [5] </ref> and Poole [33] and in Example 3. Nebel has shown that such a strategy, can satisfy almost all the AGM axioms.

The inclination to choose the scenario in which Fred dies is grounded in notions of directionality and asymmetry that are particular to causal relationships. <p> Although several remedies were proposed for the YSP within conventional nonmonotonic formalisms <ref> [35, 13, 37, 2, 24] </ref>, the formalism we explore in this paper seeks to uncover remedies systematically from basic probabilistic principles [29, pp. 509-516].

Reference-contexts: For example, if we wish to inquire whether event e will hold true after we force some variable A to become true, we simply add to the rule do (a) ) a, 22 recompute the resulting stratified ranking 0 , and compute 0 (ejdo (a)). It can be shown <ref> [16] </ref> that there is a simple relation between (eja) and 0 (ejdo (a)), which is best represented as a transformation between two ranking functions, (!) and 0 (!), the latter being an abbreviation of 0 (wjdo (a)). <p> Note that the amount of shift subtracted from (!) is equal precisely to the fraction of surprise (ajP ar A (!)) that A = true contributes to (!) and that now becomes explained away (hence excusable) by the action do (a). 4.5 Relation to KM postulates It can be shown <ref> [16] </ref> that when the update by a formula is given as a conjunction of literals (representing concurrent or sequential actions), then the movement of worlds toward = 0 will yield a set of updated beliefs consistent with the KM postulates. 23 More specifically, for every world ! j= : that is <p> the interesting power of these postulates is that they cover a wide variety of such formulations, from a simple theory such as ours to the intricate machinery of the sit ployee's salary is 50K; it could be anywhere between 40K and 60K". 24 A formal proof can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. uation calculus. Our analysis offers the KM postulates an intuitive, model-theoretic support that is well grounded in probability theory, where the distinction between observations and actions can be formulated naturally and tractably.

Reference-contexts: In probabilistic terms, consistency guarantees that for every " &gt; 0, there exists a probability distribution P such that if ' i ! i 2 , then P ( i j' i ) 1 c" ffi i (see <ref> [17] </ref>). 2.1 The most normal ranking: + Given a set , each admissible ranking induces a consequence relation j K ~, where j K ~ iff ( ^ ) &lt; (: ^ ). <p> In <ref> [17] </ref> we present an effective procedure, Procedure Z rank, for computing Z + , as well as answering queries. <p> The resulting system for default reasoning based on + and Z + is called system-Z + <ref> [15, 17] </ref>. <p> System-Z + can also be used to reason with soft evidence or imprecise observations such as when the context of a query is not given with absolute certainty, and all we have is a testimony saying that " is supported to a degree n." In <ref> [17] </ref> we establish two strategies processing such reports. The first strategy, named J-conditionalization, is based on Jeffrey's Rule of Conditioning [30]. It interprets the report as specifying that "all things considered," the new degree of disbelief for : should be 0 (:) = n. <p> Causal networks can in fact be regarded as an order of magnitude abstraction of BN's, where exact numerical probabilities are replaced by integer-valued levels of surprise (), addition is replaced by min, and multiplication is replaced by addition (see <ref> [17, 36, 32] </ref>). <p> The unique feature of the system described in this paper is that the above test can be performed by purely syntactic terms, involving only the rules in <ref> [17] </ref>. These computations are demonstrated in the following example.

In its simplified version, the YSP builds the expectation that if a gun is loaded at time t 0 and Fred is shot with the gun at time t 1 , Fred should be dead at time t 2 , despite the normal tendency of being alive to persist.

A BN is a pair hD; P i where D is a DAG and P is a probability distribution. <p> To obtain a complete proof theory for c-entailment the four axioms of graphoids <ref> [29, Chapter 3] </ref> need to be invoked. 8 However, Theorems 8 and 9 cover the essence of these axioms and are sufficiently powerful for the purposes of this paper. <p> This process of belief revision, which Spohn named ff-conditioning (with ff = 1 for this particular case), represents the ranking equivalent of Jeffrey's rule of probability kinematics <ref> [29] </ref> and was shown to comply with the AGM postulates [12]. It follows then that the process of revising beliefs in all three forms of conditioning also obey the AGM postulates.

Reference-contexts: Causal networks can in fact be regarded as an order of magnitude abstraction of BN's, where exact numerical probabilities are replaced by integer-valued levels of surprise (), addition is replaced by min, and multiplication is replaced by addition (see <ref> [17, 36, 32] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The basic idea in these syntax-based systems is to define a (total) priority order on the set of base propositions and to select revisions to be maximally consistent relative to that order as exemplified in the nonmonotonic systems of Brewka [5] and Poole <ref> [33] </ref> and in Example 3. Nebel has shown that such a strategy, can satisfy almost all the AGM axioms.

Reference-contexts: Many formulations | including circumscription [26], default logic <ref> [34] </ref>, rational closure [23], and conditional entailment [13] | reveal an alternative, perfectly symmetrical version of reality, whereby somehow the gun got unloaded and Fred is alive at time t 2 .

Reference-contexts: The basic difference between revision and update is that the latter permits changes in each possible world independently, as was proposed by Winslett <ref> [38] </ref>. 19 This type of belief change can be embodied in a stratified ranking system using the following device: For each instruction to "update the knowledge base by " we add a set of rules that simulates the action "do (), leaving everything else constant (whenever possible)", and then condition on <p> The following set of causal rules embody the intent of this action, where and 0 stand for " holds at t" and " holds at t 0 &gt; t", respectively: 20 ! 0 (15) do () ) 0 : (17) The following example (adapted from Winslett <ref> [38] </ref>) demonstrates how this device differentiates between update and revision.
