Abstract: In this paper a displacement structure technique is used to design a class of new precondition-ers for the conjugate gradient method applied to the solution of large Toeplitz linear equations. Explicit formulas are suggested for the G.Strang-type and for the T.Chan-type precondition-ers belonging to any of 8 classes of matrices diagonalized by the corresponding discrete cosine or sine transforms. Under the standard Wiener class assumption the clustering property is established for all of these preconditioners, guaranteeing a rapid convergence of the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The formulas for the G.Strang-type preconditioners have another important application : they suggest a wide variety of new O(m log m) algorithms for multiplication of a Toeplitz matrix by a vector, based on any of the 8 DCT's and DST's. Recently transformations of Toeplitz matrices to Vandermonde-like or Cauchy-like matrices have been found to be useful in developing accurate direct methods for Toeplitz linear equations. Here it is suggested to further extend the range of the transformation approach by exploring it for iterative methods; this technique allowed us to reduce the complexity of each iteration of the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to 4 discrete transforms per iteration.

Reference-contexts: The motivation for the above definition can be inferred from the easily verified fact that for any Toeplitz matrix A m the rank of r Z 1 (A m ) does not exceed 2. Although the latter definition of Toeplitz-like matrices was used by several authors <ref> [AG90] </ref>, [GO94a], it is slightly different from the standard one, r Z 0 (R) = R Z 0 RZ T where Z 0 is the lower shift matrix.
