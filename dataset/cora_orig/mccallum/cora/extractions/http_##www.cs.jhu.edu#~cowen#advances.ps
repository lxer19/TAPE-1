Reference-contexts: These three conditions give rise to two contrasts of interest for each subject: SC-R and TR-SC, yielding a data set of n = 26 PET scan volume pairs. Each 65x87x26 voxel scan has been normalized and aligned using the SPM statistical image analysis software package <ref> [11] </ref>. A voxel's value represents a measure of the change in the amount of blood flow to that area of the brain, and thus regional neural activity [12]. The resulting scan volume pairs are not readily clusterable into "schizophrenics" 11 and "normals" visually, due to a large inter-class variance. <p> Thus we consider clustering n = 26 observations in d = 2 (65x87x26)=294060 dimensions. In the PET community it is common practice, once SPM registration has been performed, to proceed by analyzing each voxel separately, i.e. disregarding spatial context <ref> [11] </ref>. Thus PET is a particularly good example for expository purposes: we can demonstrate the ease of applying our methods to small sample sizes in extremely high-dimensional settings and obtain significant results without needing to incorporate complicating spatial pre-analysis. <p> Finally, as far as the PET data sets themselves are concerned, we have recently found that restricting the region of interest via pre-processing a la `statistical parametric mapping' <ref> [11] </ref> or spatial smoothing [13] is an effective way to combine the ADC procedure with information about spatial dependencies. Acknowledgment. The authors are very grateful to Nati Linial, and his student Eran London, for bringing their work on the geometry of graphs to our attention.

This volumetric image data is naively represented as having a dimension for each voxel. Thus we consider clustering n = 26 observations in d = 2 (65x87x26)=294060 dimensions.
