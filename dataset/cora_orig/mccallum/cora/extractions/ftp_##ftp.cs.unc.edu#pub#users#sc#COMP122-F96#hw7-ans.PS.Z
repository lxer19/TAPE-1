Abstract: P-2 Exercise 17.1-2 (page 333). Suppose that we have a set of activities to schedule among a large number of lecture halls. We wish to schedule all the activities using as few lecture halls as possible. Give an efficient greedy algorithm to determine which activity should use which lecture hall. The "obvious" solution of using Greedy-Activity-Selector (p. 330 of CLR) to find a maximum-set S 1 of compatible activities from S for the first lecture hall, then using it again to find a maximum-size set S 2 of compatible activities from S - S 1 for the second hall, and so on until all the activities are assigned, requires fi(n 2 ) time in the worst case. The general idea is to go through the activities in order of start time, assigning each to any hall that is available at that time. To do this, move through the set of events consisting of activities starting and activities finishing, in order of event time. Maintain two lists of lecture halls: halls that are busy at the current event time t (because they have been assigned an activity i that started at time s i t but won't finish until time f i &gt; t) and halls that are free at time t. When t = the start time of some activity, assign that activity to a free hall and move the hall from the free list to the busy list. When t = the finish time for some activity, move the activity's hall from the busy list to the free list.
