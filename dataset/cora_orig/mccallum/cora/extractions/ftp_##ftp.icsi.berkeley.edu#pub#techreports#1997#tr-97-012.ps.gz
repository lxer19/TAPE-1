Reference-contexts: This possibility is rather restricted in using a form-driven dialogue. By assigning unique indices to the answers of the system it is possible at least to establish references from questions to former answers (this technique, for instance, is applied in the IRS AIDOS <ref> [1] </ref>). To guarantee a certain multilinguality with Method I, one has to embed elements of linguistic data processing and multilingual thesauri into this surrounding which are scarcely available for most domains of discourse and which, after all, don't fit very well into this method.

Reference-contexts: The second way to fulfil the above mentioned requirements (Method II) is oriented from the very beginning towards the natural language as the only means of communication a priori well-known to all users (this fact is especially important for "naive users"). Method II is incorporated in the system LINAS <ref> [3] </ref>. Here, the advantage of universality and great expressiveness must be contrasted with the comparatively huge costs for the preparation of the necessary background knowledge (building of large computer lexicons and comprehensive grammars suitable for automatic natural language processing).

Reference-contexts: information source) * Robustness and cooperativity (error correction, acoustic similarity; observing the correspondence between query type and answer) * Screening off the technical details (independence of the user from the knowledge about the system). 2 The first way to meet these requirements (Method I) is followed in the System MEDOC <ref> [4] </ref>. In this case the user is guided by a form-driven dialogue where the initiative stays with the system. The user will be provided with a search mask showing a fixed set of predefined attributes and a choice of logical operators to connect the attribute-value combinations entered by the user. <p> The use of this intermediate language is particularly advantageous when the IMS is supported by an assembly of brokers mediating the communication between user and information provider (as it is the case with the MEDOC system <ref> [4] </ref>). In this case, the IRL not only defines the interface between user and provider but it is also used as means of communication between different brokers.

Reference-contexts: Each time he/she wants to switch to another domain of discourse the form shown and the attribute set have to be changed. Within informa-tionally similar domains of discourse the system can be equipped with a standardized set of attributes (compare <ref> [5] </ref>) but an entirely free dialogue using this method is not realizable. Another problem arises from the need of establishing references between a question and foregoing questions or answers respectively. This possibility is rather restricted in using a form-driven dialogue.

Reference-contexts: The second component often met in bibliographic information systems is the classification system. It comprises a hierarchically organized system of non-lexicalized concepts associated with conveniently chosen rubricators defining a so-called decimal classification of informational subfields. One typical example | a part of the so-called CR-Classification <ref> [6] </ref> | is shown in the lower left side in figure 3.

Reference-contexts: The semantic representation language describes the relations between the concepts contained in the natural language query. Each concept is represented as a node in a semantic net (SN) whose expressional means are taken from the MESNET paradigm described in <ref> [7] </ref>. A fixed set of predefined relations and functions (represented as edges in the SN) is used to describe the interrelationships between two (or more) nodes.

Reference-contexts: In the last chapter, we have concentrated on SQL as a target language, in the following we want to discuss the translation of the user query into the Z39.50 protocol, which is a standard client/server protocol for information retrieval systems <ref> [8] </ref>. In contrast to SQL, there is no need for an extra hierarchy of attributes if one uses the Z39.50 protocol. In the often applied bib-1 attribute set associated with Z39.50, the attribute "Author-name" can have the following meanings: "person", "corporate author" or even "conference name". For more details see [8]. <p> <ref> [8] </ref>. In contrast to SQL, there is no need for an extra hierarchy of attributes if one uses the Z39.50 protocol.
