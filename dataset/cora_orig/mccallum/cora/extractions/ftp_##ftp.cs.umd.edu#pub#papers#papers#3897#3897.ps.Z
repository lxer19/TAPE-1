Abstract: Cross-language retrieval systems seek to use queries in one natural language to guide the retrieval of documents that might be written in another. Acquisition and representation of translation knowledge plays a central role in this process. This paper explores the utility of two sources of manually encoded translation knowledge, bilingual dictionaries and translation lexicons, for cross-language retrieval. We have implemented six query translation techniques that use bilingual dictionaries, one based on lexical-semantic analysis, and one based on direct use of the translation output from an existing machine translation system; these are compared with a document translation technique that uses output from the same existing translation system. Average precision measures on portions of the TREC collection suggest that arbitrarily selecting a single translation from a bilingual dictionary is typically no less effective than using every translation in the dictionary, that query translation using an existing machine translation system can achieve somewhat better effectiveness than simple dictionary-based techniques, and that performing document translation rather than query translation may result in further improve ments in retrieval effectiveness under some conditions.

Reference-contexts: The original lexicon contained 12,885 unique Spanish stems corresponding to 171,164 morphological variants and 29,360 bilingual pairs. We used a two-level Kimmo-based morphology system <ref> [1] </ref> to generate all morphological variants of terms matching the English terms (stemmed and unstemmed) for the subset of the topics that we processed in the El Norte collection. It is common for a single word to have several translations, some with very different meanings.

Reference-contexts: We refer to the approaches in the first group as "knowledge-based" and those in the second group as "corpus-based." Carbonell, et al. have reported excellent results when corpus-based techniques are evaluated on a held-back portion of the corpus from which the translation knowledge was extracted <ref> [4] </ref>. On the other hand, we have previously investigated the retrieval effectiveness of corpus based CLIR and found that domain shift effects can adversely affect retrieval effectiveness when translation knowledge is acquired from one corpus and then used for retrieval from a different collection [11].

Reference-contexts: A number of studies have reported that simple linguistic processing such as limiting candidate translations for query terms to those with the same part of speech, or indexing phrases as well as individual words, can raise this performance to perhaps 75% of the monolingual effectiveness (c.f., <ref> [5, 10] </ref>). In this paper we describe a new query translation technique based on Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) and compare it to an alternative technique based on the output of an existing Machine Translation (MT) system; these two are furthermore compared to some more efficient dictionary-based query translation techniques.

Reference-contexts: For example, the sentence above would correspond to the following composed representation: (be ident (attitude (mexico (toward (censorship (press))))) (at ident (attitude (mexico (toward (censorship (press))))) (wh-thing))) We have developed a technique for representing instantiated LCS forms as queries in the Parka-DB knowledge representation system <ref> [9] </ref>. Parka-DB provides an efficient technique for matching graph structures that we use to generate the terms for the target-language query. The system produces a collection of terms in the target language based on the structure of the composed LCS.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, we have previously investigated the retrieval effectiveness of corpus based CLIR and found that domain shift effects can adversely affect retrieval effectiveness when translation knowledge is acquired from one corpus and then used for retrieval from a different collection <ref> [11] </ref>. Knowledge-based techniques that exploit resources such as dictionaries and machine translation lexicons are less sensitive to this effect, so their use may be preferred when domain-specific training corpora are not available. <p> a commercial product that is designed to assist human translators by automatically preparing fairly good translations of individual documents. 7 The system is typically used by translation bureaus and other organizations as the first stage of a machine-assisted translation process, and we have previously used it for cross-language routing experiments <ref> [11] </ref>. The Logos system includes extensive facilities for adding domain-specific technical terminology and new linguistic constructs, but for the experiments reported here we used only the machine readable dictionaries and semantic rules that are delivered as standard components of the product.

Reference-contexts: So we have chosen to focus this study only on the query translation and document translation strategies. Over the past several years, query translation has emerged as the most popular strategy for fully automatic broad coverage CLIR <ref> [12] </ref>. Query translation can be quite efficient when short queries are presented, but simple query translation approaches suffer a severe penalty in effectiveness, usually achieving about half of the retrieval effectiveness of corresponding monolingual techniques when typical measures such as average precision are used.

Reference-contexts: This provides an obvious approach to query translation, but we are aware of only one prior experiment to use such a technique <ref> [14] </ref>. In that experiment, Radwan and Fluhr compared the retrieval effectiveness of queries translated from French into English by the SYSTRAN machine translation system with the effectiveness of their EMIR dictionary-based query translation system using a version of the small Cranfield collection for which French queries were available.
