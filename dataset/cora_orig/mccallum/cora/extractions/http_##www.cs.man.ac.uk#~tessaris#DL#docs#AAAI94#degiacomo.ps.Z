Abstract: One of the main themes in the area of Terminological Reasoning has been to identify description logics (DLs) that are both very expressive and decidable. A recent paper by Schild showed that this issue can be profitably addressed by relying on a correspondence between DLs and propositional dynamic logics (PDL). However Schild left open three important problems, related to the translation into PDLs of functional restrictions on roles (both direct and inverse), number restrictions, and assertions on individuals. The work reported in this paper presents a solution to these problems. The results have a twofold significance. From the standpoint of DLs, we derive decidability and complexity results for some of the most expressive logics appeared in the literature, and from the standpoint of PDLs, we derive a general methodology for the representation of several forms of program determinism and for the specification of partial computations.

Reference-contexts: Great attention is given in this approach to the complexity analysis for the various sublogics, so as to devise suitable optimization techniques and to single out tractable subcases. This approach is the one followed in the design of KRIS <ref> (Baader & Hollunder 1991) </ref>. The work presented in this paper adheres to the fourth approach, and aims at both identifying the most expressive DLs with decidable associated decision problems, and characterizing the computational complexity of reasoning in powerful DLs.

Reference-contexts: Two main advantages in using structured formalisms for knowledge representation were advocated, namely, 1 Terminological logics, and concept languages are other possible names. epistemological adequacy, and computational effectiveness. In the last decade, many efforts have been devoted to an analysis of these two aspects. In particular, starting with <ref> (Brachman & Levesque 1984) </ref>, the research on the computational complexity of the reasoning tasks associated with DLs has shown that in order to ensure decidability and/or efficiency of reasoning in all cases, one must renounce to some of the expressive power (Levesque & Brachman 1987, Nebel 1988, Nebel 1990a, Donini et

Reference-contexts: Much of the research on CLASSIC <ref> (Brachman et al. 1991) </ref> follows this approach. * The third approach, similarly to the first one, advocates very expressive languages, but, in order to achieve efficiency, accepts incomplete reasoning procedures. No general consensus exists on what kind of incompleteness is acceptable.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the large body of research on decision procedures in PDL (see, for example, Kozen & Tiuryn 1990) can be exploited in the setting of DLs, and, on the converse, the various works on tractability/intractability of DLs <ref> (see, for example, Donini et al. 1991b) </ref> can be used in the setting of PDL.

Reference-contexts: The correspondence is extremely useful for at least two reasons. On one hand, it makes clear that reasoning about assertions on classes is equivalent to reasoning about dynamic logic formulae. On the other hand, the large body of research on decision procedures in PDL <ref> (see, for example, Kozen & Tiuryn 1990) </ref> can be exploited in the setting of DLs, and, on the converse, the various works on tractability/intractability of DLs (see, for example, Donini et al. 1991b) can be used in the setting of PDL.

Reference-contexts: However, in order to fully exploit this correspondence, we need to solve at least three problems left open in <ref> (Schild 1991) </ref>, concerning how to fit functional restrictions (on both atomic roles and their inverse), number restrictions, and assertions on individuals, respectively, into the correspondence. Note that these problems refer to points (1) and (3) above. <p> A TBox K logically implies an assertion C 1 v C 2 , written K j= C 1 v C 2 , if C 1 v C 2 is satisfied by every model of K. As pointed out in <ref> (Schild 1991) </ref>, there is a direct correspondence between C and a PDL, here called D, where both atomic programs and their converse can be made (locally) deterministic. whose syntax is as follows: OE ! true j false j A j :OE j OE 1 ^ OE 2 j OE 1 _ <p> Moreover, some of these results can also be formulated in the setting of the -calculus, that has been used to model in single framework terminological cycles interpreted according to Least and Greatest Fixpoint Semantics <ref> (Nebel 1991, Schild 1994, De Giacomo & Lenzerini 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that this possibility allows one to impose the so-called global determinism too, i.e., that certain atomic programs and converse of atomic programs are globally deterministic. Therefore, DIF subsumes the logic studied in <ref> (Vardi & Wolper 1986) </ref>, called Converse Deterministic PDL, in which atomic programs (but not their converse) are globally deterministic.
