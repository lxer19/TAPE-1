Reference-contexts: We derive an alternate formulation of (1) which avoids this problem. In <ref> [2] </ref>, we apply the result to asymptotic problems. Let D be a directed graph with vertex set V and edge set E. Let the vectors x and f (x) be indexed by V . Define @f = j2V &lt; Y @ 9 ; We prove Theorem 2.
