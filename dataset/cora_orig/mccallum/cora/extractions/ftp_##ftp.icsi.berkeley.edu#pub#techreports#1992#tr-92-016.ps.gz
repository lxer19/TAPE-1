Abstract: Integrated networks of the near future are expected to provide a wide variety of services, which could consume widely differing amounts of resources. We present a framework for pricing services in integrated networks, and study the effect of pricing on user behavior and network performance. We first describe a network model that is simple, yet models details such as the wealth distribution in society, different classes of service, peak and off-peak traffic, elasticity of user's demand, and call blocking due to budgetary constraints. We then perform experiments to study the effect of setup, per packet and peak load prices on the blocking probability of two classes of calls passing through a single node enforcing admission control. Some selected results are that a) increasing prices first increases the net revenue to a provider, then causes a decrease b) peak-load pricing spreads network utilization more evenly, raising revenue while simultaneously reducing call blocking probability. Finally, we introduce a novel metric for comparing pricing schemes, and prove that for the most part, a pricing scheme involving setup prices is better than a pricing scheme without such a component. __________________ C.

Reference-contexts: While the basic pricing structure in telephone networks is simple, the pervasive regulatory structures and the de facto monopoly situation has meant that most of the research in pricing for telephone networks has been to study the effect of regulation rather than the effect of pricing on network efficiency <ref> [1] </ref>. In our work, we ignore regulatory constraints and consider only the performance effects of pricing. In recent work, Cocchi et al. [2] have studied pricing in a reservationless network.

Reference-contexts: In our work, we ignore regulatory constraints and consider only the performance effects of pricing. In recent work, Cocchi et al. <ref> [2] </ref> have studied pricing in a reservationless network. They assume that each user can be characterized by a utility function, and can request a QOS by setting bits in its packets. They show that quality sensitive pricing is more efficient (in the Pareto sense) than a flat pricing scheme.

Reference-contexts: All pricing schemes interact with the admission control scheme in responding to users' requests. Details of the real-time protocol and the admission control scheme can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. As mentioned previously, users are modeled by the triple (q = Class, T = Duration, m = Money). In this representation, q denotes the class of service required by the user.

Reference-contexts: Pricing in the telephone network has been better studied, but the telephone network offers only a single quality of service, and the costs of providing service are better known. So, it is fairly simple to set a price such that the costs (plus some profit) are recovered <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Third, the pricing scheme allows the network to manipulate user demand to optimize network usage (for example, by peak load pricing). Thus, pricing can be thought of as an important tool for congestion control at the time scale of call establishment <ref> [5] </ref>. Pricing, in combination with congestion control schemes that operate at faster time scales, can lead to networks that provide better service to everyone.
