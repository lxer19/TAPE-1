Title: Defining Data Equivalence for Efficient Access of Images in a Distributed Environment

Abstract: Technologies such as the World Wide Web have resulted in the access of information over a global network. Data can be text, images, video, or sound. Current network limitations and the large size of data items result in a high response time the time taken for an image to be transmitted from a remote site to the user. In this paper we focus on reducing this response time for images. Traditionally in an information system exact copies of text data items had to be retrieved for the user but multimedia data items such as video and images can be represented by an equivalent data item which is an approximation of the original data item. Such an equivalent data item might satisfy an application equally well and also have a lower response time. Based on the assumption that such an approximation of a data item is sufficient for several applications, we have developed an architecture where an image equivalent to the original can be retrieved instead of the original image itself. Our architecture has two layers to correspond to the two types of equivalence we define: 1) representation layer, and 2) information content layer. At the representation layer we discuss the tradeoff in using lossy compression and lossy communication. At the information content layer we discuss the usage of an equivalent data object which is semantically the same as the original. Our architecture provides support for the representation of several "equivalence levels" and we study the tradeoff of these equivalence level with response time. fl This research is supported in part by NSF grant NCR-9405931 and a NASA fellowship.

Reference-contexts: : Time taken to transmit the data object over the network t d : Time taken to display on the local computer We identify the various parameters that influence response time: transmission distance, image attributes, time of day, computation power of sender and receiver machines, physical media, and storage available <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.1.1 Information Loss Tolerable by an Image One question that should be addressed is how much can one allow the quality of an image to deteriorate for the image to be acceptable, that is, what the lowest possible quality level is.

Reference-contexts: For digital library applications we have attempted to quantify this loss with respect to the human eye <ref> [2] </ref>. We measure the amount of data an image can lose during lossy compression before the compressed image becomes distinguishable from the original to the human eye. <p> The amount of data that the image can "afford" to lose imposes a bound on lowering the quality of the image infinitely. We have quantified the amount of data an image can lose using the color information in the image <ref> [2] </ref>. The scheme is based on computing the data loss in an image by comparing the color histograms of the compressed image with the original.

Reference-contexts: The design and development of an image database system over a wide area network results in several interesting new research issues. Communication is a bottleneck in any wide area system <ref> [3] </ref> leading to a large response time. We define response time to be the delay between the time the user requests an image data item and the time it appears on the screen. Communication time is the most significant aspect of response time in a wide area network. <p> Communication time is the most significant aspect of response time in a wide area network. For example, the roundtrip time for an image file of size 250K from Purdue University in Indiana to a site in California is 26 seconds <ref> [3] </ref>. The architecture we describe in this paper reduces response time for efficient transmission of image data in conjunction with other modules for access, retrieval, browsing, and display in an image database system.

Reference-contexts: We characterize network distance between two sites using two measures: * Hop Count: This has been mentioned as a distance measure between two points in the internet in <ref> [4] </ref>. A hop count of n means that n routers separate the two sites. * Response Time: Experimentally measured response times can be used to estimate the network latency.

Reference-contexts: Image data at the storage level is a set of pixels. Each pixel represents the information of one point in the image. We have many different image formats based on how the pixel information is stored <ref> [5] </ref>: Bitmaps, Pixmaps, GIF, JPEG, HDF, RIFF to name a few. Selection of the format is important in our approach. Different quality levels should be computed with ease and interconversions between them should be computationally simple. <p> If there are several colors and a natural progression from one color region to another (such as in natural scenes) then JPEG would be the most appropriate scheme <ref> [5] </ref>. 2.1 Lossy Compression There are two basic types of compression: lossless and lossy. Lossy compression results in a much higher compression ratio than lossless compression but the original pixel intensities cannot be perfectly recovered. The quality of the image degrades as more and more data is lost.

Reference-contexts: TCP provides reliable stream delivery. This reliability is achieved at a cost of performance. We believe that a protocol with a bounded loss <ref> [10] </ref> can be used to transmit image data. A guarantee that a specified percentage of the data is transmitted is provided by such a protocol. The data which is lost in transmission can be reconstructed using the data that is received. The amount lost in transmission determines the quality levels.
