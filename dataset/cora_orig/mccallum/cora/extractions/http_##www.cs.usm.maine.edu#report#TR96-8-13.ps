Abstract: We define and study a new notion called k-immunity that lies between immunity and hyper immunity in strength. Our interest in k-immunity is justified by the result that K does not k-tt reduce to a k-immune set which improves a previous result by Kobzev [4]. We apply the result to show that K does not btt-reduce to MIN, the set of minimal indices. Other applications include the set of Kolmogorov random strings, and retraceable and regressive sets.

Reference-contexts: We set out to study this (apparently never explicitly defined) notion, which we call k-immunity. The concept has been used implicitly in several results of the past, for example by Appel and McLaughlin <ref> [1] </ref> in their study of retraceable and regressive sets. In Section 2 we define k-immunity and derive some important basic results. Our main result is presented in Section 3. It implies that K does not k-tt reduce to a k-immune set. In fact a stronger statement is true. <p> By the classic result of Dekker and Myhill a retraceable set is either computable or immune, and a regressive set is either c.e. or immune. Regarding regressive sets the following strengthening was shown by Appel and McLaughlin (stated in a different terminology naturally). Theorem 4.2 (Appel and McLaughlin <ref> [1] </ref>) A regressive set is either c.e. or !-immune. Another theorem is immediate from this (although Appel and McLaughlin do not mention this). Theorem 4.3 A retraceable set is either computable or !-immune. Proof. A retraceable set is regressive, so it is either c.e. or !-immune.

Reference-contexts: We will state all the corollaries for K, but the results also hold for some low set. In particular, for the sets R and MIN as defined in the last section we have the following corollaries. The first result is already known. Corollary 3.4 (Kummer <ref> [2] </ref>) K 6 btt R. Corollary 3.5 K 6 btt MIN. Theorem 3.2 follows as a corollary from Lemmas 3.7 and 3.9, below. For the sake of clarity we include the definition of a reduction via a fixed truth table.

Reference-contexts: Another natural example, which can be found higher up in the hierarchy is MIN, the set of minimal indices of a Godel numbering, i.e. MIN = fe j (8i &lt; e) ' i 6= ' e g.

The proof generalizes the usual immunity proof for MIN using the k-fold Recursion Theorem. Suppose MIN was not k-immune.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2 we define k-immunity and derive some important basic results. Our main result is presented in Section 3. It implies that K does not k-tt reduce to a k-immune set. In fact a stronger statement is true. This is a rediscovery of an older result by Kobzev <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> For notation and definitions of the standard concepts of computability we refer the reader to the usual sources <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. 2 The notion of k-immunity 2.1 Definition Let (D x ) x2! be a canonical numbering of the finite sets. <p> We can now prove the following general result: Theorem 3.2 If E is a separator, and M is a k-immune set, then E 6 k-tt M . This result was proved without knowledge of an earlier, weaker result by Kobzev (see Odifreddi <ref> [4, Exercise III.8.10] </ref>), which uses very similar techniques. Since K is half of a computably inseparable pair, the following corollary is immediate. Corollary 3.3 For all k 1 and any set M , if M is k-immune, then K 6 k-tt M . <p> It was observed by Fischer <ref> [4] </ref> that any btt-reducibility can be transformed into one where the truth table is fixed, i.e., independent of the input. <p> Then A is obviously retraced by a total computable function (which deletes the last bit). It is d.c.e., but neither c.e., nor co-c.e., and hence by the preceding theorem !-immune. It is not h-immune, since it contains a string of every length. Using a theorem of Kobzev and Lachlan <ref> [4] </ref> that every btt-complete set is bd-complete we can conclude with the help of theorem 4.2: Theorem 4.5 If A is regressive and K btt A, then A is c.e., and hence bd-complete. 8 5 Conclusion We have shown that k-immunity is a powerful tool in the study of bounded-truth table

Reference-contexts: This gives us a wtt-reduction from A to B. 2 Remark. The above proof showed explicitly that the constructed set A was not (k + 1)- immune. This could have been avoided by use of a lemma from <ref> [5] </ref>, which shows that if a c.e., non-computable set bounded disjunctively reduces to a set B with norm (k + 1), then the set B is not (k + 1)-immune. Using a very similar proof, !-immunity can be separated from h-immunity. We just state the results. <p> Another natural example, which can be found higher up in the hierarchy is MIN, the set of minimal indices of a Godel numbering, i.e. MIN = fe j (8i &lt; e) ' i 6= ' e g. It is well known <ref> [3, 5] </ref> that MIN is Turing-equivalent to K 0 , and that it is not h-immune. Theorem 2.8 (Schaefer [5]) MIN is !-immune. Proof. The proof generalizes the usual immunity proof for MIN using the k-fold Recursion Theorem. Suppose MIN was not k-immune. <p> MIN = fe j (8i &lt; e) ' i 6= ' e g. It is well known [3, 5] that MIN is Turing-equivalent to K 0 , and that it is not h-immune. Theorem 2.8 (Schaefer <ref> [5] </ref>) MIN is !-immune. Proof. The proof generalizes the usual immunity proof for MIN using the k-fold Recursion Theorem. Suppose MIN was not k-immune. Let D f (i) witness this as in the definition of k-immunity.
