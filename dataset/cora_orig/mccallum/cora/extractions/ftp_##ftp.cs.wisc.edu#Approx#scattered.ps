Abstract: The paper studies L 1 (IR d )-norm approximations from a space spanned by a discrete set of translates of a basis function . Attention here is restricted to functions whose Fourier transform is smooth on IR d n0, and has a singularity at the origin. Examples of such basis functions are the thin-plate splines and the multiquadrics, as well as other types of radial basis functions that are employed in Approximation Theory. The above approximation problem is well-understood in case the set of points ffi used for translating forms a lattice in IR d , and many optimal and quasi-optimal approximation schemes can already be found in the literature. In contrast, only few, mostly specific, results are known for a set ffi of scattered points. The main objective of this paper is to provide a general tool for extending approximation schemes that use integer translates of a basis function to the non-uniform case. We introduce a single, relatively simple, conversion method that preserves the approximation orders provided by a large number of schemes presently in the literature (more precisely, to almost all "stationary schemes"). In anticipation of future introduction of new schemes for uniform grids, an effort is made to impose only a few mild conditions on the function , which still allow for a unified error analysis to hold. In the course of the discussion here, the recent results of [BuDL] on scattered center approximation are reproduced and improved upon.

This means that, for the sake of extending the [DJLR]-schemes to the scattered case, the required conditions (a) and (c) of 2.1.2 are automatically satisfied. Since the error analysis of [DJLR] is based on polynomial reproduction, a careful attention is given there to the decay rates m of at 1. <p> In general, these decay rates are m = d + ` + 1 for some non-negative integer `, which means that condition (b) of 2.1.2 is also satisfied in the present case. The approximation scheme used in <ref> [DJLR] </ref> is the simple one (3:3:2) Lf := ff2ZZ d "defLL and, provided f in (3.3.1) is sufficiently smooth, the quasi-interpolation argument is employed there to yield the error estimate (3:3:3) k h f L h f k = O (h ` 0 +1 j log hj); ` 0 := minf`; <p> We refer to section 4 of <ref> [DJLR] </ref> for the full details. It is now easy to verify that all the conditions on , , and imposed in Theorem 2.2.9 and Theorem 2.2.16 are satisfied by the schemes considered in [DJLR]. <p> We refer to section 4 of <ref> [DJLR] </ref> for the full details. It is now easy to verify that all the conditions on , , and imposed in Theorem 2.2.9 and Theorem 2.2.16 are satisfied by the schemes considered in [DJLR]. Therefore, the only condition that we really need to assume is Condition 2.2.5, in order to obtain "djlrthm Theorem 3.3.4. Let be any of the basis functions considered in [DJLR] (whose Fourier transform has a singularity of even order k 0 at the origin). <p> the conditions on , , and imposed in Theorem 2.2.9 and Theorem 2.2.16 are satisfied by the schemes considered in <ref> [DJLR] </ref>. Therefore, the only condition that we really need to assume is Condition 2.2.5, in order to obtain "djlrthm Theorem 3.3.4. Let be any of the basis functions considered in [DJLR] (whose Fourier transform has a singularity of even order k 0 at the origin). Let be its localization (localized with the aid of a finite ), which decays at 1 like O (j j (d+`+1) ). <p> Our last remark here deals with the polynomials in S ffi (). It is shown in <ref> [DJLR] </ref> (cf. x3 there) that if F of (3.3.1) is the constant function (as is the case for the thin-plate splines), then we can construct the function to have an arbitrary high algebraic decay, and to reproduce k " P, with P the kernel of G (D), and k arbitrarily high. <p> In this subsection we review the results of [BuDL] with the aid of the techniques and observations of the present paper and, in this course, extend those results in several directions. The aim of [BuDL] is to extend the approximation orders on uniform grids of <ref> [DJLR] </ref> to nonuniform grids. While we did the same in the previous subsection, the error analysis we have used here and the one used in [BuDL] are entirely different. Furthermore, apparently, the approximation schemes used here and there seem to be very different, too. <p> In particular, implicitly, the approximation scheme of [BuDL] is engaged, too, with the approximation of uniform shifts by scattered shifts. The setup in [BuDL] starts with a basis function that obeys the conditions of <ref> [DJLR] </ref> (some of these conditions are quoted in the previous section). Then, for each center ~ 2 ffi, a function of the form ~ := 2ffi with ( ~; ) 2ffi a sequence of finite support (supported on centers which are close to ~), is constructed. <p> The functions ( ~ ) ~2ffi are constructed such that they decay (uniformly) at 1 at rates similar to those of of <ref> [DJLR] </ref>, i.e., O (j j d`1 ) for some non-negative integer `. The approxi mation map e L A is then defined as e L A : f 7! ~2ffi A very careful choice of the coefficients ( ~; ) enables [BuDL] to extend the results of [DJLR] to the scattered <p> those of of <ref> [DJLR] </ref>, i.e., O (j j d`1 ) for some non-negative integer `. The approxi mation map e L A is then defined as e L A : f 7! ~2ffi A very careful choice of the coefficients ( ~; ) enables [BuDL] to extend the results of [DJLR] to the scattered case. 25 122 minutes from noon of 9 September 1993 We make two preliminary observations concerning the difference between the map e L A of [BuDL] and the map L A here. <p> First, the map e L A uses the values of f at ffi only, while L A involves evaluation at ZZ d of fl f . Second, the localization sequence which is used in <ref> [DJLR] </ref> in order to construct the localized from the original (and which is used in the approach of the present paper in an essential way) is not invoked directly in [BuDL]. Instead, it is imitated in the sequences ( ~; ) 2ffi , ~ 2 ffi. <p> With N being the Gramian matrix (3:4:2) N := (-(ff fi)) ff;fi := (hN ( ff); N ( fi)i); "defnu we see that M = A T N A: Furthermore, it is proved in [BuDL] that the sequence is a suitable localization sequence for the <ref> [DJLR] </ref> construction. <p> From our factorization A T N A of M, one can observe that (i) and (ii) hold with N = ((ff fi)) ff;fi , for any localization sequence that satisfies the <ref> [DJLR] </ref> requirements, and not just for the specific -, (3.4.2), that is employed by [BuDL]. 26 122 minutes from noon of 9 September 1993 In order to see how the [BuDL]-scheme is related to the approach of the present paper, we denote := ffi = f ~ g ~ ; := <p> [BuDL]-scheme is related to the approach of the present paper, we denote := ffi = f ~ g ~ ; := ffi () = f ( ~) : ~ 2 ffig: Then, we may write = A T N A : Also, since can serve as a localization sequence of <ref> [DJLR] </ref>, it follows that := ff2ZZ d decays at 1 like O (j j (d+`+1) ). Therefore, we see that the Localization Conditions 2.1.2 are satisfied for the choice := -. <p> Indeed, for bounded approximands this is obtained directly from Theorem 3.3.4 and Corollary 3.4.4. As for unbounded approximands, the reasoning goes as follows. First, by the discussion in the last paragraph of x3.3, our scattered analog L A of the <ref> [DJLR] </ref> L provides to functions with bounded `- and ` + 1-order derivatives the desired approximation orders, provided that m A of Condition 2.2.5 is &gt; d + `. <p> In summary, the [BuDL]-scheme approximates unbounded functions to the desired rates, as soon as (i): m A &gt; d + `, (ii) m of Assumptions 3.4.1 is at least `. We can obtain (i) above from Assumptions 3.4.1 by invoking Corollary 2.7.4, which applies to all considered in <ref> [DJLR] </ref> for the choice 0 := F (0)=G (with F; G as in (3.3.1)). Condition (i) follows from that corollary if m k 0 + d + 1 &gt; d + `, i.e., if m k 0 + `. Such condition covers the required (ii), as well.
