Abstract: 2fi In this paper we investigate the extrema of fi 7! k! fi k p . Consequences of the results we obtain include: L p -bounds for Hermite interpolation, error estimates for Gauss quadrature formul with multiple nodes, and certain quantitative statements about good and best approximation by polynomials of fixed degree.

Minimising k! fi k p To show that fi 7! k! fi k p has a unique minimum, we use the following well-known result, see, e.g., [DL93:Ch.3,x5,x10]. 4 (3.1) Theorem.

Reference-contexts: In this case k! fi k 2 is the L 2 -norm of a Legendre polynomial, and can be computed exactly. For a full account of s-Gauss formul, including other error estimates, see the survey article of Gautschi <ref> [Ga81] </ref>. By using (2.4) and (2.6), it is possible to run through the above argument, to get error bounds for s-Gauss formul in terms of kD m f k q , where n (2s + 1) m n (2s + 2).

Reference-contexts: Thus Corollary (2.2) gives better bounds than (2.3) whenever m 6= n m, and the same bounds otherwise. L p -Error bounds for Hermite interpolation Let 1 p; q 1, and H fi f 2 &lt;n be the Hermite interpolant to f at fi (counting multiplicities). Recently, see Waldron <ref> [Wa94] </ref>, the author has shown that: kf H fi fk p const n;p;q;fi (b a) n+ 1 p 1 q ; (2:4) where const n;p;q;fi := n q fl fl x 7! (diamfx; fig) 1=q fl fl (b a) (n+ 1 q ) : Here diam denotes the diameter of a <p> 0, the above argument can be modified, by observing that fl fl x 7!
