Title: Adapting Crossover in Evolutionary Algorithms  
Author: William M. Spears 
Abstract: One of the issues in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is the relative importance of two search operators: mutation and crossover. Genetic algorithms (GAs) and genetic programming (GP) stress the role of crossover, while evolutionary programming (EP) and evolution strategies (ESs) stress the role of mutation. The existence of many different forms of crossover further complicates the issue. Despite theoretical analysis, it appears difficult to decide a priori which form of crossover to use, or even if crossover should be used at all. One possible solution to this difficulty is to have the EA be self-adaptive, i.e., to have the EA dynamically modify which forms of crossover to use and how often to use them, as it solves a problem. This paper describes an adaptive mechanism for controlling the use of crossover in an EA and explores the behavior of this mechanism in a number of different situations. An improvement to the adaptive mechanism is then presented. Surprisingly this improvement can also be used to enhance performance in a non-adaptive EA.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the empirical investigations, considerable effort has been directed toward theoretical comparisons between different crossover operators <ref> (e.g., De Jong and Spears 1992) </ref> and between mutation and crossover (e.g., Spears 1992). But these theories are not sufficiently gen - eral to predict when to use crossover, or what form of crossover to use. <p> Interest - ingly, although these two forms are very commonly used, they represent extremes. Two-point crossover is the least disruptive of material, while uniform crossover is the most disruptive <ref> (De Jong and Spears 1992) </ref>. Also, Booker (1992) has noted that, in terms of positional and distributional bias, both two-point and uniform crossover are considerably different.

Reference-contexts: But these theories are not sufficiently gen - eral to predict when to use crossover, or what form of crossover to use. For example, the theories do not consider population size, yet population size can affect the relative utility of crossover operators <ref> (e.g., see De Jong and Spears 1990) </ref>. Similarly, there is evidence to suggest that the relative utility of muta - tion may be affected by population size.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, practitioners of genetic algorithms (GAs) and genetic programming (GP) stress the role of crossover. In support of this, experimental results have been presented that illustrate the effectiveness of crossover <ref> (e.g., De Jong, 1975) </ref>. More recently, Schaffer and Eshelman (1991) empirically compare mutation and crossover, and conclude that crossover can exploit epistasis that mutation alone cannot. To further complicate the issue, many different forms of crossover exist. Traditionally, GAs have relied upon one- and two-point crossover operators.

Reference-contexts: Mutation is assumed to be used at some set rate and is not adapted by the EA. 2 BACKGROUND There have been two approaches to coupling adaptive mechanisms with EAs, referred to as non-self-adaptive and self-adaptive. The non-self-adaptive approach adapts the EA over the course of many runs <ref> (e.g., see Grefenstette 1986) </ref>. In contrast, the self-adaptive approach adapts the EA as it solves a single specific problem once. This approach allows for the simultaneous exploration of both the problem space and some space of different EAs.

Reference-contexts: Mutation appears to be more useful than crossover when the population size is small (Eshelman 1995; Mathias 1995), while there is evidence that crossover can be more useful than mutation when the population size is large <ref> (e.g., see Spears and Anand 1991) </ref>. Other factors, such as the representation, selection scheme, and the fitness function itself may all have an effect on the relative utility of crossover and mutation. Current EA theory is inadequate for selecting which operators to use before the EA is initiated.
