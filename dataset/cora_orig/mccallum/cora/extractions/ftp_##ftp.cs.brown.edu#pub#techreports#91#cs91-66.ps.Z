Reference-contexts: Every call to any of the subroutines should be interpreted as a dual call to the routine and its complement (executed in an interleaved fashion). When one of them answers we stop the other routine, the whole computation is still in NLOGSPACE because NLOGSPACE and CO-NLOGSPACE are the same <ref> [7] </ref>. Since the algorithm above works in LOGSPACE and uses NLOGSPACE oracles, the network stability problem in in rincr -LOGSPACE (NLOGSPACE). 2 Subramanian [16] has shown that a number of problems concerning stable marriage are equivalent to the problem of network stability in comparator gates.

Reference-contexts: When one of them answers we stop the other routine, the whole computation is still in NLOGSPACE because NLOGSPACE and CO-NLOGSPACE are the same [7]. Since the algorithm above works in LOGSPACE and uses NLOGSPACE oracles, the network stability problem in in rincr -LOGSPACE (NLOGSPACE). 2 Subramanian <ref> [16] </ref> has shown that a number of problems concerning stable marriage are equivalent to the problem of network stability in comparator gates. Decision problems based on the "man-optimal stable marriage problem " and other problems parsimoniously reducible to the comparator network stability problem are therefore in rincr -LOGSPACE (NLOGSPACE). <p> However we are unable to show that CC is in rincr -LOGSPACE (NLOGSPACE); this is because the many-one reduction used by Subramanian <ref> [16] </ref> may not be parsimonious. In particular we don't 17 know whether the network stability problem on non-bipartitionable X-gates is in rincr -LOGSPACE (NLOGSPACE).
