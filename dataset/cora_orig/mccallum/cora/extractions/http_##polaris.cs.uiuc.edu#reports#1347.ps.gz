Abstract: The objective of the Human Genome Project is to map the underlying chemical structure of the different genes that constitute the human genome. The project is very expensive, requiring the expertise of skilled biologists, numerical analysts and computer scientists. This report studies the program FALSE that performs one of the computationally intensive steps in the mapping process. FALSE calculates the conditional probability of nonoverlap between two cloned pieces of DNA with respect to an overlap statistic vector; various optimizations are used to reduce the complexity of computation. A detailed analysis of the performance of FALSE while running on an Alliant FX/2800 is presented. There exists parallelism in the code that can be exploited by manual optimization techniques. Suggestions for improving the performance of the code are also presented.

Reference-contexts: In the next section, we present and analyze the results of loop-level profiling of the subroutines MAINQ, SXSYSZ and COMPRC. 3.4 Loop-Level Profiles We instrumented the calculation of the overlap probabilities at the loop-level using the PToPP profiling tools developed at the Center for Supercomputing Research and Development <ref> [2] </ref>. PToPP measures the elapsed time for each outer DO-loop during execution of the instrumented program files. The total elapsed time normalized to that of loop 8007 of MAINQ for each outer loop in the subroutines MAINQ, SXSYSZ and COMPRC is given in Table 10.

Reference-contexts: Note that we can use probability densities on the right-hand side of the equations because we are working with discrete probabilities.

A thorough overview of DNA mapping algorithms along with pseudo-code for many of the key steps is provided in the paper by Gillett [3]. <p> The feasibility of this approach depends on the details of the specific architecture on which the code is compiled. Another opportunity for further study relates to the redefinition of the overlap probability calculation in terms of matrix permanents given in Equation (16). Applying the Laplace Expansion Theorem <ref> [6] </ref> to singular columns or rows of the submatrices of the C matrix, it may be possible to further optimize the calculation of the overlap probabilities. 5 Conclusions The FALSE code proved to be very difficult to decipher.

The nucleus contains a dense network called the chromatin-reticulum which separates into rod-like structures called the chromosomes during cell-division.

Reference-contexts: Early methods for clone mapping used a variety of strategies to identify overlap between randomly isolated clones. But in general, these approaches require a high degree of overlap between fingerprints to unambiguously determine linkage <ref> [9] </ref>. This makes the process of contig-mapping very slow and produces low-resolution maps. There are a variety of techniques and strategies that are currently being used for physical mapping. The so called bottom-up approach assembles long-range maps by identifying overlapping regions in randomly generated clones. <p> In addition, the contigs generated by repetitive sequence fingerprinting have a known degree of overlap, and provide immediately accessible information on the distribution of both restriction enzyme sites and repetitive and nonrepetitive sequences in the mapped regions <ref> [9] </ref>. 1.3.1 Fingerprint Data Collection In this section we briefly outline the process of obtaining the fingerprint data. A detailed explanation can be found in the paper by Stallings et al [9]. <p> accessible information on the distribution of both restriction enzyme sites and repetitive and nonrepetitive sequences in the mapped regions <ref> [9] </ref>. 1.3.1 Fingerprint Data Collection In this section we briefly outline the process of obtaining the fingerprint data. A detailed explanation can be found in the paper by Stallings et al [9]. First, a library [Revised Project Report | CS397GC | Spring 1992] 1.4 Mathematical Background 6 of Chromosome-16 is created by making about 26,000 clones from randomly cut pieces of the DNA strands and archiving them. <p> The data can now be used to calculate the probability of overlap for each pair of pieces. Finally, contig-mapping is performed by linking all pairs of pieces with overlap probabilities greater than some threshold value. (0.9 is used for the experiments in <ref> [9] </ref>.) The result is an ordered sequence of pieces which map the chromosome. 1.4 Mathematical Background In this section we discuss the mathematical background necessary to understand FALSE. <p> Much of the material in this section comes from the work done at the Center for Human Genome Studies at the Los Alamos National Laboratory <ref> [1, 9, 11] </ref>.

There are also significant discrepancies between the description of the code found in <ref> [9, 11, 13] </ref> and the version of FALSE we analyzed. Furthermore, the actual algorithms for matrix compression and optimization were only briefly described in the papers. We have added comments to the code in order to spare future researchers the pain we underwent trying to reverse-engineer the code.

Reference-contexts: If the outer loop (8012) is run in parallel, the granularity is larger, and the execution times of the iterations of the outer loop are uniformly distributed due to the triangular structure of the loop nest, which provides a natural form of load balancing. In <ref> [13] </ref>, IBM and Los Alamos researchers present results using this approach to parallelize the computation. However, using this approach the histogram update must be distributed and the histograms merged later. <p> Few comments exist, and some of the ones that do exist are apparently out of date.

Reference-contexts: However, using this approach the histogram update must be distributed and the histograms merged later. Two of the authors of the above-mentioned study have recently described another parallel implementation, this time using a cluster of IBM Risc System/6000 workstations, that has achieved very nice speedups <ref> [14] </ref>. If the inner loop is run in parallel, the granularity is smaller, and each successive iteration of the outer loop results in decreased parallelism. Another possible approach is to collapse the triangular loops and run all of the iterations in parallel.
