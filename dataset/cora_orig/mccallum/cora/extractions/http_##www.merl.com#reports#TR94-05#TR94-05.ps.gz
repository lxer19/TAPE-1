Abstract: This paper presents a case study in evaluating a case-based system. It describes the evaluation of Anapron, a system that pronounces names by a combination of rule-based and case-based reasoning. Three sets of experiments were run on Anapron: a set of exploratory measurements to profile the system's operation; a comparison between Anapron and other name-pronunciation systems; and a set of studies that modified various parts of the system to isolate the contribution of each. Lessons learned from these experiments for CBR evaluation methodology and for CBR theory are discussed. This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

Reference-contexts: The method requires two main knowledge sources for each subtask: a set of rules, and a case library. The rules for transcription and, to a lesser extent, for stress were based on MITalk <ref> (Allen et al. 1987) </ref> and introductory grammar texts for French, German, Italian, and Span-ish. There are 619 transcription rules and 29 stress rules. The case library was derived from a pronouncing dictionary of 5000 names.
