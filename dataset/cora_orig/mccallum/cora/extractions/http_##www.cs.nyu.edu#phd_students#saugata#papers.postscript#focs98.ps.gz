Abstract: The problem of bounding the combinatorial complexity of a single connected component (a single cell) of the complement of a set of n geometric objects in R k of constant description complexity is an important problem in computational geometry which has attracted much attention over the past decade. It has been conjectured that the combinatorial complexity of a single cell is bounded by a function much closer to O(n k1 ) rather than O(n k ) which is the bound for the combinatorial complexity of the whole arrangement. Till now, this was known to be true only for k 3 and only for some special cases in higher dimensions. A classic result in real algebraic geometry due to Oleinik-Petrovsky, Thom and Milnor, bounds the topological complexity (the sum of the Betti numbers) of basic semi-algebraic sets. However, till now no better bounds were known if we restricted attention to a single connected component of a basic semi-algebraic set. In this paper, we show how these two problems are related. We prove a new bound on the sum of the Betti numbers of one connected component of a basic semi-algebraic set which is an improvement over the Oleinik-Petrovsky-Thom-Milnor bound. This also implies that the topological complexity of a single cell, measured by the sum of the Betti numbers, is bounded by O(n k1 ): The techniques used for proving this topological result combined with those developed by Halperin and Sharir for the single cell problem in three dimensions allow us to prove a bound of O(n k1+* ) on the combinatorial complexity of a single cell. Finally, we show that under a certain natural geometric assumption on the objects (namely that, whenever they intersect the intersection is robustly

Reference-contexts: One important problem that has remained open till now has been to bound the combinatorial complexity of a single k-dimensional cell in an arrangement of n surface patches. Various special cases have been considered by researchers <ref> [14, 2, 15, 10] </ref>. In the special case, when each surface patch is a hyperplane, the combinatorial complexity of a single cell (which is a convex polytope with at most n facets) is bounded by n bk=2c by the upper bound theorem [11]. <p> For instance, a O (n k1 log n) bound was proved by Aronov and Sharir <ref> [2] </ref> (see also [15]) for the combinatorial complexity of a single cell in an arrangement of n (k 1)-simplices in R k : These bounds do not extend to general surface patches. The general problem was open in higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: For any set S R k we let S x (resp. S x ) denote S " 1 (x) (resp. S " 1 ((1; x])). A Whitney stratification of a space X is a decomposition of X into sub-manifolds called strata, which satisfy certain frontier conditions, (see <ref> [7] </ref> page 37). In particular, given a compact set bounded by a smooth algebraic hypersurface, the boundary and the interior form a Whitney stratification. Now, let X be a compact Whitney stratified subset of R k ; and f a restriction to X of a smooth function. <p> Theorem 5 (Goresky-MacPherson, <ref> [7] </ref>) As c varies in the open interval between two adjacent critical values, the topological type of X " f 1 ((1; c]) remains constant.

An `-dimensional face is popular if locally the cell C lies in all its 2 k` sides. We will give formal definitions later. One difference between our argument and that in <ref> [10] </ref> is that we have an extra dimension in the recurrence. We bound the number of popular faces of a given dimension in terms of the number of popular faces of one lower dimension. <p> k1 (l) (n=~) + ~ k (`1;j) (n=~) Moreover, (0;0) = O (n k1 ): These recurrences yield the desired bound of O (n k1+* ) on (k) (n) and hence on the combinatorial complexity of a single cell. 5.1 Solving the recurrence We follow a similar scheme as in <ref> [10] </ref> with minor modifications.

For this we use a classical perturbation technique originally due to Milnor <ref> [12] </ref>. Let S R k be a surface patch. For simplicity, we first assume that S is a basic semi-algebraic set defined by P 1 0; : : : ; P r 0; and let D be a connected component of S. We also assume that D is bounded.
