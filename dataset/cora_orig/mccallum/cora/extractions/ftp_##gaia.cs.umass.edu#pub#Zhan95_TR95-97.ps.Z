Abstract: We establish asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic decay rate of per-session queue length tail distributions for a multiple-queue system where a single constant rate server services the queues using the generalized processor sharing (GPS) scheduling discipline. As an indication of the tightness of the bounds, in the special case where there are only two queues, the upper and lower bounds match, yielding the optimal bound proved in [15]. The dynamics of bandwidth sharing of a multiple-queue GPS system is captured using the notion of partial feasible sets, and the bounds are obtained using the sample-path large deviation principle. The results have implications in call admission control for high-speed communication networks.

This fact indicates the tightness of the bounds. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a quick overview of a few large deviation results regarding discrete-Time G/ D/ 1/ 1 queueing systems which will be used in this paper. <p> We prove the Main Theorem in Section 4. The proof is established in two parts, the upper bound part (Section 4.1) and the lower bound part (Section 4.2).

To see this, we proceed as follows. Without loss of generality, assume that 1 + 2 = 1. First, if ff 2 (0) 2 c, then for all &gt; 0, F () = f;g. <p> ff 1 g inf fl fl A 1 (ff 1 ) (60) where the last equality follows from the fact that inf x&gt;ff 1 fl fl A 1 (x) = inf xff 1 fl fl A 1 (ff) is increasing for ff 1 Ea 1 (0) (see Fact 2 in <ref> [15] </ref>). <p> ff i = ff ( A 1 (ff 1 ) + i2E B (ff i ) = inf ff 1 + i2E ff i = ff ( A 1 (ff 1 ) + i2E B (ff i ) : (64) This can be proved in a similar manner as in <ref> [15] </ref>: note that if ff i &lt; Ea i (0), then fl fl A i (ff i ) 0 = fl fl particular, if i 2 E, as Ea i (0) &lt; r F i (), then fl fl B (ff i ) = fl fl A i (Ea i (0)) <p> Thus (I fl ) fl = I, and I (ff) is essentially smooth and strictly convex (see <ref> [15] </ref> or Theorem VI.5.3 and Theorem VI.5.6 in [8]). From the definition of ff D i (; r F i ()), we see that ff D i (; r F i ()) = fl B ()=. <p> When there are only two queues, the lower and upper bounds match, yielding exactly the same result established in <ref> [15] </ref>. The proofs are based on the sample path large deviation principle and exploit the complex bandwidth sharing structure of the GPS scheduling using the notion of partial feasible sets. Our results are more general than the results of [7] on the multiple-queue GPS systems.
