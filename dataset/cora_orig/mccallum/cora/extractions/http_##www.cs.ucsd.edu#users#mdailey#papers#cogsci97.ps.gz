Abstract: A considerable body of evidence from prosopagnosia, a deficit in face recognition dissociable from nonface object recognition, indicates that the visual system devotes a specialized functional area to mechanisms appropriate for face processing. We present a modular neural network composed of two expert networks and one mediating gate network with the task of learning to recognize the faces of 12 individuals and classifying 36 nonface objects as members of one of three classes. While learning the task, the network tends to divide labor between the two expert modules, with one expert specializing in face processing and the other specializing in nonface object processing. After training, we observe the network's performance on a test set as one of the experts is progressively damaged. The results roughly agree with data reported for prosopagnosic patients: as damage to the face expert increases, the network's face recognition performance decreases dramatically while its object classification performance drops slowly. We conclude that data-driven competitive learning between two unbiased functional units can give rise to localized face processing, and that selective damage in such a system could underlie prosopagnosia.

Reference-contexts: Martha Farah and her colleagues have performed two important experiments providing further evidence of a specialization for face processing. In the first, they constructed a within-class discrimination task involving faces and visually similar eyeglasses <ref> (Farah, Levinson, & Klein, 1995a) </ref>. Normal subjects were significantly better at discriminating the faces than the eyeglasses, but the prosopagnosic patient L.H. did not show this effect.

Reference-contexts: His face discrimination performance was significantly lower than that of the control group, but his eyeglass discrimination performance was comparable to that of the controls. In the other experiment, the researchers compared L.H.'s performance in recognizing inverted faces to that of normals <ref> (Farah, Wilson, Drain, & Tanaka, 1995b) </ref>. The surprising result was that whereas normal subjects were significantly better at recognizing upright faces than inverted ones, L.H. performed normally on the inverted faces but was actually worse at recognizing the upright faces than the inverted ones. <p> Work on covert face recognition in prosopagnosics measuring skin conductance during face recognition tasks (e.g. Tranel & Damasio, 1988) and evidence for the mandatory nature of the face processing system <ref> (Farah et al., 1995b) </ref> seem to argue that the process of mediating between the face and nonface object systems actually occurs before recognition. We plan to investigate ways to account for this data in future models.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, such constraints, such as the prevalence of face stimuli in the newborn's environment, different maturation rates in different areas of the brain, and a possibly innate preference for tracking faces, may well be at work during infant development <ref> (Johnson & Morton, 1991) </ref>. Despite the lack of a strong face/nonface separation in the network, damaging the face expert affects face recognition accuracy disproportionately, compared with how damage to the nonface expert affects object recognition accuracy.

Reference-contexts: The wavelet resembles a sinusoid restricted by a Gaussian function, may be tuned to a particular orientation and frequency, and is similar to the observed receptive fields of simple cells in primary visual cortex <ref> (Jones & Palmer, 1987) </ref>. A jet is formed by combining the response of several filters with different orientations. As an image feature detector, the jet exhibits some invariance to background, translation, distortion, and size (Buhmann, Lades, & von der Malsburg, 1990).

Reference-contexts: A mediator, on the basis of a representation of the stimulus itself, mixes the output of the two systems to generate a final decision on the identity or class of the stimulus. For the current study, we implemented the model with the mixture of experts neural network architecture <ref> (Jordan & Ja-cobs, 1995) </ref>, trained the network to perform a combined face identification and object classification task, and found that competitive learning between two identical expert modules can result in a division of labor in which one expert dominates in face pattern processing and the other dominates in nonface object pattern <p> Note that with 192 patterns and 192 dimensions, the training set is almost certainly linearly separable. Mixture of Experts Network Architecture We modeled the face and object recognition task with the mixture of experts architecture <ref> (Jordan & Jacobs, 1995) </ref>. network i is a single-layer linear network that computes an output vector O i as a function of the input vector x and a set of parameters i . We assume that each expert specializes in a different area of the input space.

Reference-contexts: This double dissociation between face and object recognition provides a strong argument that the visual system contains elements specialized for face processing, although it does not necessarily imply a distinct face module <ref> (Plaut, 1995) </ref>. In light of the double dissociation, we propose a simple visual system model: Recognition of face-like stimuli and non-face-like stimuli is accomplished by specialized but possibly overlapping mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: We predict that these changes to the object recognition task will cause a clearer dissociation of object recognition from face recognition when damaging so-called object experts.
