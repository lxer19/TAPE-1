Reference-contexts: If f is a polynomial chosen from H 2 (X) according to D then the probability that (f ) jXj=k 1=2* is strictly less than 1. It is well known (see e.g., <ref> [2] </ref> ) that for any integers k m, there is an explicitly constructible set S (m; k) of vectors in f0; 1g m having size at most (2m) d (k+1)=2e such that for a vector v chosen uniformly at random from S (m; k), the coordinates of v are k-wise independent <p> Furthermore, using the construction in <ref> [2] </ref>, the basis vectors which generate this set can be computed in logarithmic space.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, a result of Hastad [8] says that computing the parity function in depth d requires W (2 "n 1=(d1) ) gates for some " &lt; 1. Except for the constant " this result is essentially tight. Recently, Hastad, Jukna, and Pudlak <ref> [9] </ref> described a top down approach for proving lower bounds on depth 3 circuits. However, these and other techniques seem incapable of proving a lower bound on depth 3 circuits of the form W (2 h (n) p n ) with h (n) unbounded, for any explicit Boolean function. <p> is a constant " 1 such that for any k 1, any S k 3 circuit for the parity function or the majority function requires W (2 "n=k ) gates at level 2, and such bounds are tight for k = O ( p As in Hastad, Jukna, and Pudlak <ref> [9] </ref>, our motivation is to prove stronger lower bounds on depth-3 circuits that go beyond the above trade-off between bottom fan-in and size. <p> These subsets, called projections, are defined by equating literals to each other or to constants. The starting point for our argument is the top-down approach used in <ref> [9] </ref>, which says that if the number of gates at level 2 is small, there must be a depth 2 subcircuit that accepts a large number of inputs. We prove that such a depth-2 subcircuit (which is a 2-CNF formula) must accept a projection of large size. <p> AND gate) at the top. The inputs are viewed as feeding into the first level, and the top gate is at the d th level. Similar to <ref> [9] </ref>, we define S k d (resp. P k d ) to be the class of circuits in S d (resp. P d ) such that all gates at the first level have fan-in at most k.

Reference-contexts: We note that even for constant bottom fan-in k 2, currently known lower bound techniques seem incapable of providing a lower bound better than 2 n=k on the number of gates at level 2. There is another independent compelling motivation for studying the depth-3 model with limited fan-in. Valiant <ref> [14] </ref> showed that linear-size logarithmic-depth Boolean circuits with bounded fan-in can be computed by depth-3 unbounded fan-in circuits of size O (2 n= log log n ) and bottom fan-in limited by n " for arbitrarily small ". <p> If we consider linear-size logarithmic-depth circuits with the additional restriction that the graph of the connections is series-parallel, then such circuits can be computed by depth-3 unbounded fan-in circuits of size 2 n=2 with bounded bottom fan-in <ref> [14] </ref>. Thus, strong exponential lower bounds on depth 3 circuits would imply nonlinear lower bounds on size of fan-in 2 Boolean circuits with logarithmic-depth, an open problem proposed some twenty years ago [14]. In this paper, we take a modest step towards proving such strong bounds on depth-3 circuits. <p> such circuits can be computed by depth-3 unbounded fan-in circuits of size 2 n=2 with bounded bottom fan-in <ref> [14] </ref>. Thus, strong exponential lower bounds on depth 3 circuits would imply nonlinear lower bounds on size of fan-in 2 Boolean circuits with logarithmic-depth, an open problem proposed some twenty years ago [14]. In this paper, we take a modest step towards proving such strong bounds on depth-3 circuits. We show that for some explicit func tion, contained in log-space uniform N C 1 , any S 2 3 circuit that computes it must have at least 2 no (n) gates.

Reference-contexts: If A is a set of codewords for a code with rate r and distance ffi, then A has size 2 rn and cannot contain a projection of dimension larger than n=ffi. We can use constructions of linear codes to come up with `dense' sets with no large projections <ref> [15] </ref>. For example, one can construct binary BCH codes with codeword length n, dimension n 1 t log n and distance 2t + 1.
