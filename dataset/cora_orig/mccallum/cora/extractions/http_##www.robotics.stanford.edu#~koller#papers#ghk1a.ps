Abstract: Motivated by problems that arise in computing degrees of belief, we consider the problem of computing asymptotic conditional probabilities for first-order sentences. Given first-order sentences ' and , we consider the structures with domain f1; : : : ; N g that satisfy , and compute the fraction of them in which ' is true. We then consider what happens to this fraction as N gets large. This extends the work on 0-1 laws that considers the limiting probability of first-order sentences, by considering asymptotic conditional probabilities. As shown by Liogon'ki [Lio69], if there is a non-unary predicate symbol in the vocabulary, asymptotic conditional probabilities do not always exist. We extend this result to show that asymptotic conditional probabilities do not always exist for any reasonable notion of limit. Liogon'ki also showed that the problem of deciding whether the limit exists is undecidable. We analyze the complexity of three problems with respect to this limit: deciding whether it is well-defined, whether it exists, and whether it lies in some nontrivial interval. Matching upper and lower bounds are given for all three problems, showing them to be highly undecidable. fl Some of this research was done while all three authors were at IBM Almaden Research Center. During this work, the first author was at Stanford University, and was supported by an IBM Graduate Fellowship.

Reference-contexts: In many applications, including the one of most interest to us, it makes sense to consider finite domains only. In the first-order case, our approach essentially generalizes the methods used in the work on 0-1 laws to the case of conditional probabilities. (See Compton's overview <ref> [Com88] </ref> for an introduction to this work.) Assume, without loss of generality, that the domain is f1; : : : ; N g for some natural number N . As we said above, we consider two notions of "situation". <p> Fagin [Fag76] and Lio-gon'ki [Lio69] independently showed that asymptotic conditional probabilities do not necessarily converge to any limit.

The fact that there is an increase in complexity in inductive logic when we add non-unary predicates is not substantiated by Carnap, other than by the observation that very difficult combinatorial questions arise.

Reference-contexts: Precisely the same definitions of asymptotic probability are used in the context of 0-1 laws for first-order logic, but without allowing arbitrary prior information . The original 0-1 law, proved independently by Glebski et al. [GKLT69] and Fagin <ref> [Fag76] </ref>, states that the asymptotic probability of any first-order sentence ' with no constant or function symbols is either 0 or 1. Intuitively, such a sentence is true in almost all finite structures, or in almost none. <p> That is, we want the probability of ' over the class of finite structures defined by . Some work has already been done on aspects of this question. Fagin <ref> [Fag76] </ref> and Lio-gon'ki [Lio69] independently showed that asymptotic conditional probabilities do not necessarily converge to any limit. Subsequently, 0-1 laws were proved for special classes of first-order structures (such as graphs, tournaments, partial orders, etc.; see the overview paper [Com88] for details and further references). <p> This example, together with Proposition 2.1, also demonstrates that the values of conditional probabilities generally differ between the random-worlds method and the random-structures method. By way of contrast, Fagin <ref> [Fag76] </ref> showed that the random-worlds and random-structures methods give the same answers for unconditional probabilities, if we do not have constant or function symbols in the language. 4 When we say that two limits are equal, we mean that one is well-defined iff the other is, one exists iff the other <p> Theorem 3.1: <ref> [Lio69, Fag76] </ref> Let be a vocabulary containing at least one non-unary predicate symbol.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, such a sentence is true in almost all finite structures, or in almost none. Interestingly, this 0-1 law holds under both the random-worlds and the random-structures methods; in fact, both approaches lead to the same asymptotic probability in this case <ref> [Fag77] </ref>. Our work differs from the original work on 0-1 laws in two respects. The first is relatively minor: we need to allow the use of constant symbols in ', as they are necessary when discussing individuals (such as patients).

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the pure first-order case is still difficult, and is important because it provides a foundation for all extensions. In this paper and in <ref> [GHK93] </ref> we address the problem of computing conditional probabilities in the first-order case. In a companion paper [GHK94], we consider the case of statistical knowledge. The general problem of assigning probabilities to first-order sentences has been well studied (cf. [Gai60, Gai64]). <p> However, it follows from our undecidability results that we cannot tell which algorithm is the correct one. So even this result holds no real promise. In a companion paper <ref> [GHK93] </ref>, we extend Liogon'ki's results for the case of conditioning on unary formulas. This special case turns out to be quite important for our application; see [GHK94, BGHK92, BGHK93]. Our undecidability results are of more than purely technical interest. The random-worlds method is of considerable theoretical and practical importance. <p> For the purpose of this paper, we assume that is finite. We discuss the possibility of an infinite vocabulary in <ref> [GHK93] </ref>; it turns out that there are various ways to extend the relevant concepts to the infinite case, but that, for generally trivial reasons, all the results in this paper hold under any of these definitions. <p> Remark 2.3: (a) If 32Pr w 1 ('j) is well-defined, then so is 23Pr w 1 ('j). The converse is not necessarily true. 5 (b) If both 32Pr w 1 ('j) and 23Pr w 1 ('j) are well-defined, then they are equal. 4 It follows from our results in <ref> [GHK93] </ref> that the two notions of limiting probability coincide if we restrict to unary predicates or to languages without equality. 2.2 The random-structures method One way of thinking about the random-worlds method is that it treats each individual in f1; : : :; N g as having a distinct name or <p> One particular case which is of interest to us in this paper is the following: Proposition 2.6: If contains at least one non-unary predicate symbol that does not appear in , then 23Pr w 1 ('j) : This proposition is a special case of Corollary 2.7 in <ref> [GHK93] </ref>, so we do not prove it here. 3 Nonexistence results In this section, we show that the limiting probability 23Pr w 1 ('j) (and hence 32Pr w 1 ('j)) does not always exist. <p> If we restrict to refer only to unary predicates and constants, many of the problems we encounter in the general case disappear. This holds even if ' can refer to arbitrary predicates. In the companion paper <ref> [GHK93] </ref> we focus on this important special case. Here, we consider one other case. A close look at our proofs in the previous sections shows that we typically started by constructing sentences of low quantification depth, that use (among other things) an unbounded 23 number of unary predicates.

We would also like to thank Moshe for pointing out the reference <ref> [Lio69] </ref>, and for suggesting the technique used to prove Theorem 4.6.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we actually consider two notions: the persistent limit, denoted 32Pr w 1 ('j), and the intermittent limit, denoted 23Pr w 1 ('j) (the prefixes stand for the temporal logic representation of the persistence and intermittence properties <ref> [MP92] </ref>). In either case, we say that the limiting probability is either not well-defined, does not exist, or is some number between 0 or 1. The only difference between the two notions lies in when the limiting probability is taken to be well-defined.

Reference-contexts: These are techniques which try to assign "limits" to sequences that do not converge in the conventional sense. There is a general framework for summability techniques, which we now explain. 6 (See, for example, <ref> [PS72] </ref> for further details.) Let A = (a ij ) be an infinite square matrix; that is, a ij is a (possibly complex) number for each pair of natural numbers i; j. <p> This ensures that we really do obtain a more general notion of convergence. The regularity condition has been well studied. The following three conditions are known to be necessary and sufficient for A to be regular. (This result is known as the Silverman-Toeplitz theorem; see <ref> [PS72] </ref>.)

Reference-contexts: There are well-known results from physics that show the close connection between the random-worlds method and maximum entropy [Jay78]; some formalization of similar results, but in a framework that is closer to that of the current paper, can be found in <ref> [PV89, GHK94] </ref>. <p> We thank Moshe Vardi for pointing out to us the work of Liogon'ki [Lio69]. 3 These results are of far more interest when there are statistical assertions in the language, so we do not discuss them here (see <ref> [PV89, GHK94] </ref> for more details). 3 It is interesting to note that in [Car52], where Carnap considers a continuum of methods for inductive reasoning (which includes the random-worlds method and a variant of the random-structures method), he considers only the unary case for all of them, without any comment or justification.

Reference-contexts: We analyze the complexity of these problems in terms of the arithmetic hierarchy. This is a hierarchy that extends the notions of r.e. (recursively enumerable) and co-r.e. sets. We briefly review the relevant definitions here, referring the reader to <ref> [Rog67, Chapter 14] </ref> for further details. Consider a formula ~ in the language of arithmetic (i.e., using 0; 1; +; fi) having 14 j free variables. <p> This proves the upper bounds. It is well known that the following problem is 2 0 -complete: "Given a Turing machine M, does M halt on infinitely many inputs?", and the dual problem|"Given a Turing machine M, does M halt on only finitely many inputs?"|is 2 0 -complete <ref> [Rog67, Theorem 13-VIII; Corollary 14-VIII (b)] </ref>. We prove the two lower bounds by reducing these problems to intermittent and persistent well-definedness, respectively. <p> equivalently, the inputs on which the x th Turing machine halts, in some enumeration of Turing machines), the set fz : 8y (y 2 W z ) W y finiteg is 0 3 -complete. (The complement of this set is proved to be 0 3 -complete in Theorem 14-XV of <ref> [Rog67] </ref>.) For our purposes it is slightly better to consider a variant of this problem, namely "Does each of the Turing machines in a given r.e. set of Turing machines enter some distinguished state, say 16 q s , only finitely many times when started on the empty input?" The two

Reference-contexts: All of our lower bounds are also based on this construction. The main idea is the well-known fact that we can use first-order sentences, interpreted over finite domains, to encode (arbitrarily long) prefixes of the computation of a deterministic Turing machine (see <ref> [Tra50] </ref>). That is, given a Turing machine M, we can define a sentence M such that any finite model satisfying M encodes a finite prefix of the computation of M on empty input. The exact construction is fairly standard, but requires many details; we present only an outline here.
