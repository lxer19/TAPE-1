Reference-contexts: Different medical imaging applications may require the selection of different anatomic landmarks. In neuron tracing, the branching points of the dendrites and the locations of soma can serve as landmarks <ref> [1] </ref>. Main bone edges in X 14 ray peripheral imaging and contrast medium filled vessels in angiography [7] can be the preferred landmarks. In cytology specimens, locations of cell or selectively stained subcellular components such as the nuclei provide a natural set of landmarks. <p> Measurements from individual images cannot be simply added up. However, correct measurements can be obtained from properly mosaicked 27 images. There has been significant interest in automatically or semi-automatically assembling ocular fundus sub-images into larger images <ref> [20, 1, 9, 25, 10, 36, 35] </ref>. Matching based on correlation of pixel intensities may not be appropriate for this application because of large contrast variations between images. <p> To circumvent this problem, Dani and Chaudhuri [9] suggest the use of a correction factor, or correlating the gradient values instead of pixel intensities. Most existing papers, however, do landmark-based matching. Vascular branching and crossover points are used as the natural landmarks for this application <ref> [25, 1] </ref>. Image processing methods identify vascular structures first, perform some type of skeletonization, gather statistics at junction and branch points of the vascular structures, and match these landmark points. The primary transformation between adjacent images is translation.

Reference-contexts: While it does not require prior knowledge or significant effort in preprocessing, it has several drawbacks. Pixel correlation is not appropriate when there are intensity or contrast variations be 13 tween images. It also can be slow for large images or 3D volume mosaicking <ref> [2] </ref>. Unlike whole image matching or registration, matching for image mosaicking usually involves different portions of the image pair. Therefore, if there is any geometric distortion, the distortions in the mosaicked areas may be different. <p> Mosaicking is done in order 1 in [25] and in order 4 in <ref> [11, 2] </ref>. 2.4 Issues in mosaic presentation Navigation images: Usually mosaicked images are too large to be shown at full resolution on a normal monitor, or even to store all at once in the memory. Even with the use of scroll bars, the mosaic image may be unmanageable. <p> Translation is the only transformation considered. The images were digitized from microscope negatives in [11], whereas some later papers attached cameras directly to the microscope. 3.1.4 Cytological analysis using confocal microscopy One particular method for 3-D image mosaic preparation in cytological analysis is described in <ref> [2] </ref>. Three dimensional (3-D) light microscopy of biological specimens, ranging from single cells a few micrometers thick, to tissue slices several hundred micrometers thick, is rapidly maturing. <p> This paper [7] also describes several considerations for displaying mosaic results. 30 3.6 Upcoming applications 3.6.1 3D montages of brain images Montaging large numbers of 3D images and displaying the results using 3D graphics provides a new perspective on the 3D organization of large volumes of brain tissue <ref> [2] </ref>. It provides a convenient method for visually and quantitatively evaluating large-scale structural relationships that cannot be approached by other methods. This technology may be useful in applications in which the number and distribution of cells varies as a function of development, disease, exposure to toxins, or medical treatment.

For example, commercially available 3D ultrasound systems such as the Kretztech-nik system (http://boss.kretz.co.at) can examine only small volumes at a time.

Imaging, </booktitle> <volume> volume 3034, </volume> <pages> pages 1077-1087. </pages> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: Examples 7 include injected contrast enhancement agents <ref> [7] </ref> and special light sources [8]. 2.1.3 Object positioning Restricting the movement of the object being imaged during acquisition simplifies the subsequent matching problem. It also enables comparing mosaic images of different objects, or of the same object taken at different times. <p> One example is peripheral angiography, where at each station along the legs, a sequence of images is acquired to record the filling of contrast medium in blood vessels <ref> [7] </ref>. It becomes important in such cases to choose and use the correct frame from each partial view for mosaicking. <p> Global affine matching is suitable for stable objects when image scaling or gantry tilt information is missing or unreliable. Local transformations are not appropriate if they show discontinuities at the borders of local regions. An exception is the full-leg mosaic application <ref> [7] </ref>, which uses organ-sized local transformation to account for individual leg movements between images. The most popular method to compute translations between images is cross-correlation (Section 2.2.4). It is common practice to speedup computation by restricting the size of the neighborhood (window) for global search, using camera movement information. <p> Instead of using pixel-correlation, an alternate matching method uses a few detected prominent intrinsic landmarks and applies a min/max mathematical function to measure the goodness of matching for these landmarks. An example of such an application can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. In clinical practice, physicians tend to match images by using correspondence of the locations of anatomically meaningful visual events in the images. Anatomical landmarks are the top level of such events. <p> Different medical imaging applications may require the selection of different anatomic landmarks. In neuron tracing, the branching points of the dendrites and the locations of soma can serve as landmarks [1]. Main bone edges in X 14 ray peripheral imaging and contrast medium filled vessels in angiography <ref> [7] </ref> can be the preferred landmarks. In cytology specimens, locations of cell or selectively stained subcellular components such as the nuclei provide a natural set of landmarks. By using anatomic landmark for matching, the mosaic process can be more accurate and efficient. <p> We outline below four strategies that have been used for overlap computation in the literature. * Clean Cut: The overlap region is divided into two halves, along the direction of overlap. The first half contains pixel values from the first image and the second half from the second image <ref> [7] </ref>. This method has 17 the disadvantage that the "seam" between the mosaicked images may be clearly visible and distracting. However, it has a very desirable property that the individual images are in no way altered. <p> This helps the human perceive the global structure, and decide what areas of need to be examined at full resolution. Navigational images also proved useful for making measurements across several partial images. Use of navigational images can be seen in <ref> [39, 7] </ref>. Computer aided perception: Image processing tools such as edge enhancement, windowing can be provided to help the human visualize the mosaicked image better [8, 7]. <p> Navigational images also proved useful for making measurements across several partial images. Use of navigational images can be seen in [39, 7]. Computer aided perception: Image processing tools such as edge enhancement, windowing can be provided to help the human visualize the mosaicked image better <ref> [8, 7] </ref>. They may also facilitate better automatic measurements from the image. 21 Flexible, easy-to-use interfaces: While making clinical assessments or mea-surements from a mosaic image, a physician may want to manually fine-tune the overlap between partial views [7]. The user interfaces should allow for such tuning. <p> They may also facilitate better automatic measurements from the image. 21 Flexible, easy-to-use interfaces: While making clinical assessments or mea-surements from a mosaic image, a physician may want to manually fine-tune the overlap between partial views <ref> [7] </ref>. The user interfaces should allow for such tuning. <p> For visualization and diagnosis purposes, images at each station give only a local view. A full-leg mosaicked xray peripheral angiography image is shown in Figure 7. This image is composed by using a method and system developed at Siemens by the authors <ref> [7] </ref>. In this application, the mechanical movement parameters of the gantry provide rough estimates of the amount of overlap. However, they are not accurate enough to be used directly for matching. There may be patient movement, 29 possibly resulting from the burning sensation caused by the contrast injection. <p> A more general, fully automatic method, which uses a global matching criterion to find the appropriate translations in the x and y directions is described in <ref> [7] </ref>. The mosaic process relies on anatomical information/landmarks, without the need for mechanical movement parameters. This technique includes limited capability for dealing with variable motion between the legs (for two-leg studies). <p> This technique includes limited capability for dealing with variable motion between the legs (for two-leg studies). This method automatically mosaics two legs separately since the matching parameters for left and right leg may not be consistent due to the patient's motion. This paper <ref> [7] </ref> also describes several considerations for displaying mosaic results. 30 3.6 Upcoming applications 3.6.1 3D montages of brain images Montaging large numbers of 3D images and displaying the results using 3D graphics provides a new perspective on the 3D organization of large volumes of brain tissue [2].

Reference-contexts: Examples 7 include injected contrast enhancement agents [7] and special light sources <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.1.3 Object positioning Restricting the movement of the object being imaged during acquisition simplifies the subsequent matching problem. It also enables comparing mosaic images of different objects, or of the same object taken at different times. Several papers have appeared in the literature on restraining human patient motion. <p> Several papers have appeared in the literature on restraining human patient motion. See [38] for a review. There is also work on restricting the motion of non-human subjects. For example, a stereo-tactic holding and positioning device used for fixing the position of a rabbit's cornea is described in <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.1.4 Neighborhood adjacency To form a montage of a given set of images, it is necessary to know their relative positioning, also referred to as neighborhood adjacency [9]. Finding the neighborhood adjacency automatically from images is usually very difficult. <p> An example is in opthalmology, where care needs to be taken to align multiple views of the cornea so as to avoid distortions due to corneal curvature <ref> [8] </ref>. The use of global rigid transformations is sufficient for many biomedical ap 11 plications. Complex transformations may not even be desirable because they can introduce artifacts into the mosaicked image. Global affine matching is suitable for stable objects when image scaling or gantry tilt information is missing or unreliable. <p> Most existing mosaic methods are incapable of dealing with varying levels of magnification [32]. One technique used is to explicitly measure, and correct for, scaling at the acquisition time. A calibrated scale is imaged in the imaging plane immediately after the object in <ref> [8] </ref>. Other ad hoc approaches which can deal with translation, rotation as well as magnification have also been reported [16]. 2.2.4 Matching visual events and anatomic landmarks There are many ways to perform matching, and many target visual events may be selected for matching. <p> Some existing mosaic methods take the help of a human during matching, e.g., for identifying a few corresponding fiduciary marks <ref> [8] </ref>. This is sometimes desirable because it utilizes the rapid pattern recognition capabilities of the human observer and quickly defines the overlap zone. However, too much human interaction can adversely effect the applicability of a mosaic method. <p> Repeat this step for all overlapping images [39]. So, if the partial images are visited in a horizontal raster scan order, pixel values from the bottom right-most overlapping image would supercede all others. * Best value: In corneal imaging applications <ref> [8] </ref>, the strategy for elimination of duplicate pixels is to retain the pixel element with the least geometrical distortion due to corneal curvature. * Blended: The most popular strategy is to perform a weighted combination of the pixel intensities from the images being mosaicked. <p> For example, although intensity dif-ferences between adjacent image segments in a mosaic may be readily apparent to the human observer, such differences have little effect on measuring blood vessel area <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.3.3 Order of mosaicking When more than two images overlap at the same position, the resulting mosaic changes depending on the order in which individual pairs of images are mo-saicked. The variation may be in terms of the computed transformations, or the combined pixel values. <p> Navigational images also proved useful for making measurements across several partial images. Use of navigational images can be seen in [39, 7]. Computer aided perception: Image processing tools such as edge enhancement, windowing can be provided to help the human visualize the mosaicked image better <ref> [8, 7] </ref>. They may also facilitate better automatic measurements from the image. 21 Flexible, easy-to-use interfaces: While making clinical assessments or mea-surements from a mosaic image, a physician may want to manually fine-tune the overlap between partial views [7]. The user interfaces should allow for such tuning. <p> Accurate manual measurement of corneal neovasculariza-tion is a time consuming process. A method that uses mosaicking of overlapping ocular video microscopy images of the cornea of a rabbit and using the resulting image for making quantitative measurements of vessel area is described in <ref> [8] </ref>. 3.1.2 Drug Testing Effectiveness of some new drugs may be evaluated by assessing the ability of the drug to produce anatomical changes.

Finding the neighborhood adjacency automatically from images is usually very difficult. In most biomedical applications, the camera or gantry movement is well-defined, providing the neighborhood adjacency graph (NAG) implicitly. Ultrasound is an exception where the physician freely moves a hand-held transducer while acquiring images. <p> Several ad hoc methods for handling rotations have been used in the literature. Such methods assume that rotations are within some small range, reasoning that larger rotations can be detected during image acquisition <ref> [9] </ref>. As an example, Pham and Abdollahi [25] mosaic ocular fundus images with possible rotation in the following manner. After dealing with translation, one of the images is rotated in 1 degree increments from -5 degrees to 5 degrees. <p> Measurements from individual images cannot be simply added up. However, correct measurements can be obtained from properly mosaicked 27 images. There has been significant interest in automatically or semi-automatically assembling ocular fundus sub-images into larger images <ref> [20, 1, 9, 25, 10, 36, 35] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Pre-segmentation can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the automatic mosaicking. Pre-segmentation itself may be fully automatic or interactive. Of course, the final image mosaic needs to include all information from the original images, not just the structures of interest. An example of pre-segmentation may be found in <ref> [11] </ref>, where the micro-capillaries in partial video micrographs are first automatically segmented and then matching is done through cross-correlation of the capillary edges. 2.2.3 Transformations Transformations refer to the changes that should be applied to the coordinate systems of images to be mosaicked. <p> Mosaicking is done in order 1 in [25] and in order 4 in <ref> [11, 2] </ref>. 2.4 Issues in mosaic presentation Navigation images: Usually mosaicked images are too large to be shown at full resolution on a normal monitor, or even to store all at once in the memory.

Reference-contexts: In digital mosaic mammography, 26 arrays of CCD sensors, with small and overlapping fields of view, read out the signal from an x-ray image imprint <ref> [13] </ref>. The images acquired by individual CCDs are subsequently combined into a large image. Advantages of digital mosaic mammography are high resolution, large field of view and low cost. Image matching in this problem is trivial because the location and overlap between sensors are known precisely.

Reference-contexts: In response to thermal or mechanical injury or chemical cautery, blood vessels may develop in the cornea. Consequently, there has been a long-standing effort to understand the mechanisms of new blood vessel generation (neovasculariza-tion) in the cornea <ref> [15] </ref>. These mechanisms can be understood by measuring quantitatively the spatial and temporal changes in the corneal vessels. Such measurements are also useful for evaluating the efficacy of potential inhibitors of neovascularization. Accurate manual measurement of corneal neovasculariza-tion is a time consuming process.

Do weighted averaging within each pyramid level and then combine the results [5].

Reference-contexts: Each serial section may be too large for the field of view of the microscope and may consist of several overlapping micrographs. 3D reconstruction of cellular, capillary or other structures from serial sections has been an active topic of research starting in the 1970s <ref> [17, 19, 29, 22] </ref>. This task involves first mosaicking the images in each serial section and then registering the mosaicked images using manually or automatically generated landmarks.

Reference-contexts: Several ad hoc methods for handling rotations have been used in the literature. Such methods assume that rotations are within some small range, reasoning that larger rotations can be detected during image acquisition [9]. As an example, Pham and Abdollahi <ref> [25] </ref> mosaic ocular fundus images with possible rotation in the following manner. After dealing with translation, one of the images is rotated in 1 degree increments from -5 degrees to 5 degrees. The maximum matching score among all 10 positions gives the correct rotation. <p> For example, after computing translations between pairs of images in order 1, they may need to be refined to ensure that each individual image fits correctly with all its neighbors, whereas no such adjustment is necessary in order 4. Mosaicking is done in order 1 in <ref> [25] </ref> and in order 4 in [11, 2]. 2.4 Issues in mosaic presentation Navigation images: Usually mosaicked images are too large to be shown at full resolution on a normal monitor, or even to store all at once in the memory. <p> Measurements from individual images cannot be simply added up. However, correct measurements can be obtained from properly mosaicked 27 images. There has been significant interest in automatically or semi-automatically assembling ocular fundus sub-images into larger images <ref> [20, 1, 9, 25, 10, 36, 35] </ref>. Matching based on correlation of pixel intensities may not be appropriate for this application because of large contrast variations between images. <p> To circumvent this problem, Dani and Chaudhuri [9] suggest the use of a correction factor, or correlating the gradient values instead of pixel intensities. Most existing papers, however, do landmark-based matching. Vascular branching and crossover points are used as the natural landmarks for this application <ref> [25, 1] </ref>. Image processing methods identify vascular structures first, perform some type of skeletonization, gather statistics at junction and branch points of the vascular structures, and match these landmark points. The primary transformation between adjacent images is translation.

Reference-contexts: It is common practice to speedup computation by restricting the size of the neighborhood (window) for global search, using camera movement information. Rotational matching can be achieved through cross-correlation just like translation, because a rotational shift in Cartesian coordinates is equivalent to a translational shift in polar coordinates <ref> [26] </ref>. Several ad hoc methods for handling rotations have been used in the literature. Such methods assume that rotations are within some small range, reasoning that larger rotations can be detected during image acquisition [9]. <p> There is a set of features or measurements associated with each level of the visual event hierarchy. One of the popular methods for matching computation is pixel-level cross correlation between each pair of images <ref> [26] </ref>. While it does not require prior knowledge or significant effort in preprocessing, it has several drawbacks. Pixel correlation is not appropriate when there are intensity or contrast variations be 13 tween images. It also can be slow for large images or 3D volume mosaicking [2].

Reference-contexts: Since significant visual events are hierarchically structured in nature, however, the matching can be performed at different levels of the hierarchy. For example, the grouped directional topographic primal sketch (DTPS) <ref> [27] </ref>, which has significant correlation to anatomies in the image, can well serve as the visual events between raw pixels and higher-level anatomic landmarks. The grouped intensity ridges and valleys on the image intensity 15 surfaces, for example, are more robust then raw pixel intensity for matching.

Reference-contexts: A visual event is a physical occurance in the visual field or, at a higher level, an interpretation of a physical occurrence <ref> [28] </ref>. The matching candidates can be ranged hierarchically from raw pixel level up to more semantically meaningful identities, such as anatomic landmarks. These visual events also range from local to global.

Reference-contexts: After finding the translations and rotations between individual pairs of images, these values are further refined so that individual images are well positioned according to 12 all their neighbors. Most existing mosaic methods are incapable of dealing with varying levels of magnification <ref> [32] </ref>. One technique used is to explicitly measure, and correct for, scaling at the acquisition time. A calibrated scale is imaged in the imaging plane immediately after the object in [8].

Reference-contexts: One way to accomplish fully digital acquisition is by employing CCD sensors to observe an "imprint" of an x-ray mammogram on a surface such as amorphous selenium <ref> [33] </ref>. In digital mosaic mammography, 26 arrays of CCD sensors, with small and overlapping fields of view, read out the signal from an x-ray image imprint [13]. The images acquired by individual CCDs are subsequently combined into a large image.

Reference-contexts: We collect and discuss such issues in this section. Note that, depending on the application, some of the above four stages may be more important than the others. For example, in digital mosaic mammography <ref> [34] </ref> and ultrasound [40], mosaicking is done at image acquisition time, so the 2nd and 3rd stages become sub-stages of stage 1. <p> Some complication is presented by the distortions caused by the optical component prior to mosaicking. A technique for distortion correction that employs custom designed calibration screens for the calculation of camera distortion and intra-camera disparity is described in <ref> [34] </ref>. 3.3 Ocular fundus imagery The ocular fundus refers to the inside back portion of the eye, including the retina, the retinal pigment epithelium and the choroid. Opthalmologists commonly compare fundus images with overlapping content in order to observe the progression of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy.

Reference-contexts: In most applications, mosaicking is used as a post-processing step to aid in visualization or measurement. 6 2.1 Issues in image acquisition 2.1.1 Prospective mosaicking In their review paper on medical image matching <ref> [38] </ref>, Elsen et al. differentiate between prospective and retrospective matching. Prospective methods assume that it is known at the acquisition time that the image will be used for matching. In the mosaicking context, this implies that the acquisition protocol is modified to enable stitching together the acquired images. <p> Most biomedical mosaicking is prospective because partial views are purposefully acquired with overlaps and with known adjacency. 2.1.2 Intrinsic versus. extrinsic matching Image matching may be done based on intrinsic, i.e., patient related properties, or based on extrinsic properties induced by artificial objects that are added to the patient <ref> [38] </ref>. (Intrinsic properties are further described in Section 2.2.4.) An important issue to consider while using extrinsic properties for matching is patient friendliness. Extrinsic methods may not be suitable for some applications because the object of interest may be deformable. <p> It also enables comparing mosaic images of different objects, or of the same object taken at different times. Several papers have appeared in the literature on restraining human patient motion. See <ref> [38] </ref> for a review. There is also work on restricting the motion of non-human subjects. <p> For a good overview of possible transformations in medical image matching, see <ref> [38] </ref>. Our coverage below is much more restricted: we concentrate on transformation-related issues specific to mosaick-ing. The movements of the camera as well as the object being imaged are well-restricted in most biomedical mosaicking applications. This means, in general, that the transformations are not too complex. <p> It is often necessary to limit matching errors to a pre-specified upper limit, for liability reasons. Objective estimates of the error involved in a matching method are hard to come by. Matching literature is often not specific on the accuracy achieved. See <ref> [38] </ref> for several pointers on existing methods for evaluating the precision of matching methods, using phantoms, by comparing two uncorrelated methods and using artificial data. 2.3 Issues in mosaic computation 2.3.1 Resolving overlap pixels Each pixel in overlap regions occurs in two or more images (assuming there was no interpolation at

Reference-contexts: However, the matching problem should not be considered trivial. Matching gets complicated due to factors such as the following: * Even though camera movement parameters may be available at acquisition time, nontrivial matching is needed due to the variance in these 10 parameters. For example, Vogt et al. <ref> [39] </ref> describe a mosaic application in which images are acquired using a precision microscope stage that has a standard deviation of 0.5 microns. At 60 pixels per micron resolution, this translates to 30 pixels. <p> In transmission electron microscopy (TEM), long exposures of a tissue sample to an electron beam may result in "etching" which causes distortions in partial views <ref> [39] </ref>). * The geometry of the object being imaged may be the cause of distortion. An example is in opthalmology, where care needs to be taken to align multiple views of the cornea so as to avoid distortions due to corneal curvature [8]. <p> This is sometimes desirable because it utilizes the rapid pattern recognition capabilities of the human observer and quickly defines the overlap zone. However, too much human interaction can adversely effect the applicability of a mosaic method. If the amount of data to be mosaicked is very large <ref> [39] </ref>, interactive mosaicking is not practical. Another issue to be taken into account is the human subjectivity. Inter and intra-human variation may not be acceptable in applications where the mosaic images are to be used for quantitative measurements. <p> At all overlap pixels where there is a valid intensity value in the second image, overwrite the existing value with the value from the second image. Repeat this step for all overlapping images <ref> [39] </ref>. <p> This helps the human perceive the global structure, and decide what areas of need to be examined at full resolution. Navigational images also proved useful for making measurements across several partial images. Use of navigational images can be seen in <ref> [39, 7] </ref>. Computer aided perception: Image processing tools such as edge enhancement, windowing can be provided to help the human visualize the mosaicked image better [8, 7]. <p> For example, a drug for diabetic retinopathy may be tested by studying the cell structure and distribution in high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of tissue <ref> [39] </ref>. Traditionally electron micrograph films were taken, developed and literally pasted together manually to form gigantic images, a few yards across, which would then be reviewed by a human anatomist using a magnifying glass. <p> A typical clinical test would involve hundreds of samples, each of which has to be carefully analyzed by a human expert. Hence fast and reliable mosaicking is needed along with an intelligent way to present the final gigantic image. One comprehensive solution to this problem is described in <ref> [39] </ref>. For illustration, Figure 2 shows a use of computer mosaicking in transmission electron video micrography. 3.1.3 Reconstruction from serial sections When examining tissue with, say, a transmission electron microscope (TEM), images of several serial sections (i.e., slices) are taken.

Reference-contexts: We collect and discuss such issues in this section. Note that, depending on the application, some of the above four stages may be more important than the others. For example, in digital mosaic mammography [34] and ultrasound <ref> [40] </ref>, mosaicking is done at image acquisition time, so the 2nd and 3rd stages become sub-stages of stage 1. <p> In most biomedical applications, the camera or gantry movement is well-defined, providing the neighborhood adjacency graph (NAG) implicitly. Ultrasound is an exception where the physician freely moves a hand-held transducer while acquiring images. In this case, adjacent frames have very substantial overlaps and the transducer motion can be estimated <ref> [40] </ref>. A hypothetical mosaic configuration and its NAG are shown in Figure 1. <p> The primary transformation between adjacent images is translation. Rotation between images is non-existent or very small, because the patient's head motion is restricted while capturing images. 3.4 Ultrasound SieScape TM is a panoramic ultrasound imaging system patented by Siemens Medical Systems <ref> [40] </ref> which uses image processing to produce a large field-of-view image with conventional free-hand real-time transducers. This technology's applications have included scanning muscular haematomas and viewing enlarged organs and large abdominal wall masses (http://www.siescape.com/).

Reference-contexts: The interface to present the mosaic results should be flexible. For example, it should allow the physician to see images at individual stations at full resolution as needed. An early attempt at displaying whole-leg images <ref> [41, 42] </ref> uses a simple matching function, which minimizes the difference between sums of pixel values of each pair of adjacent rows for alignment, after the images are put together roughly by using gantry movement parameters.
