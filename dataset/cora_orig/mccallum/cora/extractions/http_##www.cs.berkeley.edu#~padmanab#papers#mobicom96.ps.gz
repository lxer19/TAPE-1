Abstract: Future internetworks will include large numbers of portable devices moving among small wireless cells. We propose a hierarchical mobility management scheme for such networks. Our scheme exploits locality in user mobility to restrict handoff processing to the vicinity of a mobile node. It thus reduces handoff latency and the load on the internetwork. Our design is based on the Internet Protocol (IP) and is compatible with the Mobile IP standard. We also present experimental results for the lowest level of the hierarchy. We implemented our local handoff mechanism on Unix-based portable computers and base stations, and measured its performance on a WaveLAN network. These measurements show that our handoffs are fast enough to avoid noticeable disruptions in interactive voice traffic. For example, our handoff protocol completes less than 10 milliseconds after a mobile node initiates it. Our mechanism also recovers from packet losses suffered during the transition from one cell to another. This work helps extend Internet telephony and teleconferencing to mobile devices that communicate over wireless networks.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical and low-latency handoff schemes have also been proposed for connection-oriented data networks, particularly for wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. Acampora et al. <ref> [1] </ref> propose building a virtual connection tree covering base stations in a local area, with virtual circuits pre-established from the root of the tree to each base station. A handoff thus involves only switching to an already established virtual circuit.

Reference-contexts: Eng et al. [9] use a route chaining technique to extend virtual circuits to the mobile's new location. They can later collapse these chains into a new virtual circuit to obtain a more efficient route. Agrawal et al. <ref> [2] </ref> propose another scheme based on extending and collapsing virtual circuits. Toh [25] treats groups of adjacent wireless cells as a cluster, and handles movement within a cluster in a single ATM switch that is connected to all the base stations in the cluster.

Reference-contexts: We conclude that the throughput problems we observed were due to MAC-layer effects and are independent of our handoff mechanism. MAC procedures have been proposed that provide fair access to a shared wireless medium, for example those based on a Request to Send-Clear to Send (RTS-CTS) etiquette <ref> [3] </ref>. Our results motivate the use of these improved MAC procedures, not only to achieve fairness among application data streams, but also to reduce handoff jitter. 6 Future Work We can extend the work presented in this paper in a number of ways.

Reference-contexts: Base stations could differentiate traffic types through implicit information like packet size, or through explicit information like the type of service field in current IP headers. Plans for offering integrated services in the Internet <ref> [4] </ref> call for routers to apply different scheduling policies to different traffic streams. Next-generation IP headers will contain a flow id field to identify packets from different traffic streams.

Reference-contexts: Aside from the fact that the end-to-end mechanism takes more time to become aware of a loss, TCP reacts to losses by initiating congestion control procedures that further reduce throughput <ref> [5] </ref>. However, our measurements did not show the expected throughput improvements due to lowering the beacon period because of problems with the Media Access Control (MAC) procedures used by WaveLAN. More frequent beacons should increase throughput because they lower the rendezvous time, resulting in fewer packets lost during a hand-off.

Reference-contexts: This mechanism extends cleanly to next-generation IP networks. The functionality of the current ARP, including gratuitous and proxy ARP, will be available in these networks through the neighbor discovery features of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for IPv6 <ref> [6] </ref>. 4 Implementation We implemented our local handoff mechanism on a Solaris 2.4 software platform. All protocol elements reside in the Unix kernel under the Streams framework, while some control software resides in a user-level program at base stations.

Reference-contexts: Such filtering is especially important given the limited bandwidth of wireless links. Second, a base station can differentiate between packet types based on the type of service field in current IP headers, or the flow id field in next-generation IP headers <ref> [7] </ref>. Careful packet scheduling is especially important at the interface between a wired link and a slower wireless link. This paper also presents the design and implementation of a fast and reliable handoff mechanism for the lowest level of our hierarchy.

However, it requires that a mobile node's home network be notified of every change of location. The route optimization option to Mobile IP <ref> [12] </ref> further requires that every new location be registered with hosts that are actively communicating with the mobile node. These location updates incur the latency of traveling to the possibly distant home network and communicating hosts. They also add traffic to the wide-area portion of the internetwork. <p> The care-of address identifies a foreign agent in the foreign sub-net. An MH's foreign agent can reside in the MH itself, or in a separate node that in turn forwards traffic to the MH. The proposed route optimization option to Mobile IP <ref> [12] </ref> further requires that location update messages be sent to correspondent hosts, that is, to hosts actively communicating with the MH. We believe that using Mobile IP to handle all movement in a large internetwork would not meet the stated latency, reliability, and scalability goals.

In such cases, it will likely be necessary to inform the home domain of the movement because of security, billing, and other considerations.

Reference-contexts: IP multicast groups provide an effective criterion on which to base forwarding decisions, namely whether any mobile hosts in a cell are subscribed to a group. For example, different multicast groups could be used to carry different layers of a video stream encoded with layered coding techniques <ref> [16] </ref>. A mobile host could subscribe only to the subset of layers appropriate to the bandwidth limitations of its wireless link, and the base station would forward only that subset. Third, it may be beneficial for the handoff mechanism to differentiate between traffic types.

Seshan <ref> [22] </ref> proposes a scheme in which a mobile's home agent encapsulates data destined for the mobile in multicast packets, and sends these packets to multiple base stations in close vicinity of the mobile. <p> Instead of arriving at the regular intervals dictated by the timer at the base station, beacons sometimes arrived in clumps. The long-term average of beacon interarrival times was close to the expected value, but there were large deviations. Seshan <ref> [22] </ref> has also noted a similar behavior in WaveLAN. Like other current wireless networks, WaveLAN uses a Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme that allows a station to obtain an unfair share of the channel.

Reference-contexts: Our scheme restricts mobility management traffic to the immediate area surrounding the mobile node, and thus reduces handoff latency and the load on the internetwork. Our handoff scheme applies to the Internet. It is based on IP <ref> [24] </ref> and integrates seamlessly with Mobile IP. Our base stations are network-layer routers, in contrast to the link-layer bridges commonly used by existing local-area wireless networks.

Our base stations are network-layer routers, in contrast to the link-layer bridges commonly used by existing local-area wireless networks. These base stations use the gratuitous and proxy features of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [24] to maintain the illusion that wireless hosts reside on a wired link. An IP-based routing solution offers two important advantages over the link-layer bridging approach. First, a base station can filter traffic based on IP multicast groups. It can participate in the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [24] and forward <p> Protocol (ARP) <ref> [24] </ref> to maintain the illusion that wireless hosts reside on a wired link. An IP-based routing solution offers two important advantages over the link-layer bridging approach. First, a base station can filter traffic based on IP multicast groups. It can participate in the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [24] and forward only that multicast traffic for which there is an interested receiver. Such filtering is especially important given the limited bandwidth of wireless links. <p> When an MH registers with a BS, the BS broadcasts over the wired link an ARP packet that maps the MH's network-level address to the BS's link-layer address. The ARP specification requires nodes to update their ARP caches with the information in new ARP broadcasts <ref> [24] </ref>. Therefore, any nodes with existing ARP entries for the MH that point to the old BS will update them to point to the new BS. They thus will send subsequent packets for the MH directly to the new BS. <p> This functionality includes generating and processing handoff protocol messages, processing the above ioctl types, and interacting with the buffer module. Handoff protocol messages take the form of small ICMP packets <ref> [24] </ref>. We defined new ICMP types for the following messages: Beacon, Greet, Greet Ack, Notify, and Notify Ack. The size of our ICMP packets is 42 bytes, or the sum of the lengths of the ICMP, IP, and WaveLAN headers. <p> We also measured the impact of beacons on application-layer throughput as measured by the ttcp benchmark. The concern here is that the overhead of frequent beacons on the wireless medium may adversely affect application performance. ttcp measures Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <ref> [24] </ref> throughput between two hosts by setting up a connection, sending a specified amount of data, and closing the connection. Our ttcp experiments involved sending 4 Mbytes of data in 1024-byte segments. <p> is not surprising considering that only a few pointer and counter manipulations are involved in buffering each packet. 5.3 Packet Audio Performance The main goal of our experiments was to evaluate the effects of handoffs on Internet audio applications that are built on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [24] </ref>. Examples of these applications are vat (visual audio tool) and nevot (network voice terminal), commonly used over the MBone (Multicast Backbone) [15]. We wrote a simple benchmark program, udpbench, that sends a stream of UDP packets from one host to another.
