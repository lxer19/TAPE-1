Title: The Map-Learning Critter

Abstract: The Critter is an artificial creature which learns, not only the structure of its (simulated) environment, but also the interpretation of the actions and senses that give it access to that environment. The Map-Learning Critter embodies a strong a priori hypothesis: that its environment is, at least in part, structured as a large-scale space consisting of places connected by paths. The Critter's learning strategy begins by diagnosing its actions and senses. By performing experiments and examining the periodicity of its sense-impressions, it classifies actions as "turn-like," "travel-like," and "others." After the actions are classified, it becomes possible to aggregate sets of sense-impressions to define places; then places are linked into paths. An exploration strategy assures that the entire environment will be explored and assimilated into this model. The Map-Learning Critter has been implemented and has experienced a variety of reasonable and unreasonable environments. Some implications of the results are discussed, and directions for future research are outlined. fl Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Technical Report AI-TR-85-17, University of Texas at Austin, December 1985.
