Abstract: We consider the family of area bisectors of a polygon (possibly with holes) in the plane. We say that two bisectors of a polygon P are combinatorially distinct if they induce different partitionings of the vertices of P . We show that there are simple polygons with n vertices that have (n 2 ) combina-torially distinct area bisectors (matching the obvious upper bound), and we present an output-sensitive algorithm for computing an explicit representation of all the bisectors of a given polygon. Our study is motivated by the development of novel, flexible feeding devices for parts positioning and orienting. The question of determining all the bisectors of polygonal parts arises in connection with the development of efficient part positioning strategies when using these devices.

In <ref> [3] </ref>, we devise a technique for analyzing programmable vector fields called equilibrium analysis, lower bounds (i.e., impossibility results) on what the devices cannot do, and results on a classification of control strategies yielding design criteria by which well-behaved manipulation strategies may 13th ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry, Nice, France, June 1997. <p> A squeeze field is defined by making all the actuators push normally towards a common squeeze line. In <ref> [3] </ref>, we show that under certain dynamic and mechanical assumptions, we can compute a sequence of squeeze fields guaranteed to bring any part into unique moment equilibrium. No sensing is required, but a clock is required to switch between fields. <p> The number of equilibria critically impacts both the complexity of plan generation, and plan size. Therefore, it is important to bound the number of equilibria for a given part or class of parts. In <ref> [3] </ref> we show that every convex part has at most O (n) equilibria, and every non-convex part has O (rn 2 ) equilibria (r is the maximum number of edges of P intersected by any line), under squeeze fields. <p> There exist O (r) lines 0 that are combinatorially equivalent to such that P is in total equilibrium when 0 coincides with the center line of a squeeze field. It follows that a squeeze field induces a finite number of total equilibria on a polygonal part P . In <ref> [3] </ref> we show how to exploit this finiteness property to automatically generate alignment plans that bring P into a unique (up to symmetry) orientation, by cascading squeeze fields that systematically reduce the possible orientations of P .
