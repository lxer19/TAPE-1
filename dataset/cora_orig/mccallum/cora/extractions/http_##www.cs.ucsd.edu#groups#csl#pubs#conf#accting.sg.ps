Abstract: We describe steps toward an accounting mechanism to attribute Internet resource consumption based on service quality. Our objective is not to describe a complete accounting and billing system. Rather we advocate taking advantage of existing Internet instrumentation to implement incremental improvements in the short to medium term. Experience from these improvements can enable us to make more educated progress towards a comprehensive Internet accounting system.

Reference-contexts: Section 7 summarizes our proposals and discusses directions for further research. 2 Motivation Two ever-advancing trends motivate our objective of deploying more effective Internet accounting mechanisms in the short-term. First, as interconnectivity and resource sharing among network providers continues to increase <ref> [3] </ref>, providers will need mechanisms to determine the extent and fairness of their traffic exchange. Both commercial and non-commercial, domestic and international, providers will track how they "use each other's bandwidth". The second and perhaps more critical trend is the demand which newer real-time multimedia applications place on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: ANS gateway customers can elect to pay according to a tiered structure if their average link utilization (SNMP 15 minute averages measured) falls within the 10%, 20%, 30% bands. Mills et. al. discusses other experiments that link statistics to billing <ref> [4] </ref>. ternet make any centralized accounting scheme impractical at best; a reasonable mechanism must be decentralized. Optimally, a given service provider would only need to attribute consumption of his network resources to immediately adjacent clients, using a traffic matrix among the interfaces to those immediately attached clients. <p> The provider could then bill these clients without regard for other components of the Internet system. This adjacency requirement, depicted in Figure 1, is not a new notion. Mills et. al <ref> [4] </ref> describe a decentralized scheme for the Internet environment which relies on interactions between adjacent Administrative Domains (ADs).

Reference-contexts: A value different from the baseline value in this field would then indicate the purchase of a higher level service, and clients using those values would pay higher service fees. Although current routers do not necessarily support this component of the IP specification, the IP standard <ref> [5] </ref> documents it, which should allow vendors to incorporate it into their IP implementations. We note that in a usage-insensitive environment, such as the traditionally bulk-funded NSFNET, users would likely misuse the power to specify a precedence value, routinely demanding higher service precedence.
