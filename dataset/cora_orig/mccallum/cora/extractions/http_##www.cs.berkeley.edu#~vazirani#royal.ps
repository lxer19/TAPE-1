Arora, et. al. <ref> [AIV] </ref> formalize the folk notion that any result in complexity theory that is proved using only simulation and diagonalization arguments holds relative to all oracles.

The non-relativizing form of the Cook-Levin theorem says that any language with a polynomial time checkable proof of membership also has a checkable proof of membership. <ref> [AIV] </ref> also argue that all the recent non-relativizing results in complexity theory depend upon the (prominent) use of the Cook-Levin theorem in their proof.

Reference-contexts: In view of these results it is natural to ask whether quantum computers can solve all problems in the class N P (or N P " co N P ) in polynomial time. Bennett, et. al. <ref> [BBBV] </ref> gave evidence that this question is unlikely to be resolved without a major breakthrough in complexity theory, by showing that relative to a random oracle, N P 6 BQT IM E (o (2 n=2 )). <p> Email: vazirani@cs.berkeley.edu. 2 quantum search algorithm.

As in all oracle lower bounds, the results of [BBBV] are proved by establishing a lower bound on the number of oracle queries that the algorithm must make. More generally, in the black box model, the algorithm is not given the input explicitly, but is instead allowed to query bits of the input. <p> In this section, we show that this problem cannot be solved in asymptotically less than 2 n=2 steps by any quantum algorithm with bounded error. Thus N P A 6 BQT IM E (o (2 n=2 )) A . The actual results of <ref> [BBBV] </ref> on which this section is based are somewhat stronger. They show that that relative to a random oracle, N P 6 BQT IM E (o (2 n=2 )). <p> In view of this we can conclude that the results in <ref> [BBBV] </ref> indicate that there are two ways to design a polynomial time quantum algorithm for N P (or N P " co N P ): a) By using the Cook-Levin theorem in an essential way in the design of the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Beals, et. al. <ref> [BBCMW] </ref> introduced a new framework, involving polynomials, for establishing lower bounds in the black box model; they proved a general result showing that D (f ) = O (Q (f ) 6 ). <p> Therefore we omit its proof. 4 Block Sensitivity and the Black Box Model: In this section we continue to work in the black box model.

Reference-contexts: Finally we consider the question: how "reasonable" is the quantum computation model? There are several "unreasonable" classical models of computation, in which it is possible to factor numbers or even solve N P -complete problems in polynomial time (see <ref> [Sha1] </ref> for a particularly delightful example). In each case, these models rely on being able to carry out operations on numbers with exponentially many bits in a single computational step.

What distinguishes quantum computation from classical computation is our ability to prepare the system to solve a computational problem of our choice.
