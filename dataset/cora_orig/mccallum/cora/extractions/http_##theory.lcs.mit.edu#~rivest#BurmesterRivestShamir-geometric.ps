Abstract: We propose the field of "geometric cryptography," where messages and ciphertexts may be represented by geometric quantities such as angles or intervals, and where computation is performed by ruler and compass constructions. We describe a elegant little zero-knowledge identification scheme, based on the impossibility of trisecting an angle using ruler and compass operations.

Reference-contexts: This must have caused them considerable consternation, and was kept secret for some time (irrational = ffoflo& , which, according to some scholars means, unutterable). It was said that Hippasus, the first Pythagorean to divulge the unutterable, was thrown off a ship and so perished <ref> [2] </ref>. The school however overcame this setback and later, according to Euclid, was the first school to develop a general theory of irrationality [2]. 3 For ruler and compass constructions such as angle bisections, this equation is trivial: only radicals are involved, and these cancel out. 4 In the 5th and <p> It was said that Hippasus, the first Pythagorean to divulge the unutterable, was thrown off a ship and so perished <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Given any circle and a line that meets it, one can construct the point (s) of intersection. These axioms are paraphrased from the excellent survey of geometry <ref> [3] </ref>. The undefined terms (such as "points," "interval," "between," "congruent," and so on) are used in other axioms (not given here) that delimit their meaning. <p> Recently Peter Neumann proved that Ptolemy's spherical mirror problem (finding the point on a sperical mirror where a ray is reflected from a source to an observer) cannot be solved by ruler and compass [8].

Reference-contexts: We leave as interesting open problems the development of other primitives of geometric cryptography, such as secure encryption techniques or secure signature schemes. (We note that Rompel's proof <ref> [4] </ref> that "one-way functions are necessary and sufficient for secure signatures" may not apply here, since his proof depends upon the binary representation of messages and ciphertexts.) 6 Acknowledgments We dedicate this paper to Jose Pastor, who organized a marvelous gala dinner at Eurocrypt '96, at which dinner this research began.

Reference-contexts: This protocol is an interactive proof of knowledge of the angle X A (the identity of Alice) with error 2 t . The protocol is also zero-knowledge. Below we sketch a simplified proof for this (a formal proof can easily be obtained by using the approach in <ref> [5] </ref>). If Alice and Bob follow the protocol then clearly Bob will always accept Alice's proof of identity. <p> We feel that this protocol is simple and clear enough that it forms an excellent pedagogical example of a zero-knowledge identification protocol, such as may be used for high-school students. For a general discussion on interactive proofs, zero-knowledge and identification schemes the reader is referred to <ref> [7, 5, 6] </ref>. 3 Security the model and background The goal with the classical constructions is to find a theoretical solution to geometrical problems by using a ruler and a compass, assuming that these have perfect precision. <p> If a prover succeeds in convincing the verifier with probability greater than the error 2 t , then M can extract X A (or an equivalent geometric object) by "probing and resetting" the prover <ref> [5] </ref>. With geometric cryptography there are no complexity bounds on M. 2 Bob may use a non-uniform distribution. The following proceedure is used to simulate Bob's view [6]. Suppose that the transcripts of r &lt; t rounds have been simulated. Flip a fair coin and construct the corresponding transcript. <p> Therefore it will lead with reasonable probability to an impossible trisection of the angle N . A similar technique was used to prove the security of parallel execution of the Fiat-Shamir identification protocol <ref> [5] </ref>, which is not known to be zero knowledge. 5 Discussion and Conclusions We suggest that the field of geometric cryptography may be a fruitful one for further study, as it may yield both illuminating examples and insight into cryptographic fundamentals.

Reference-contexts: Thus Bob will accept with probability no better than 1=2 for each iteration, and no better than 2 t for the t iterations. 1 It follows that the protocol is proof of knowledge of X A <ref> [6] </ref>. Next we show that the protocol is zero-knowledge. That is, it is possible to simulate Bob's "view" during the execution of the protocol. Now Bob "sees" the messages of Alice and his own coin flips. The transcripts of these are of type (R; "heads"; K) or (R; "tails"; L). <p> We feel that this protocol is simple and clear enough that it forms an excellent pedagogical example of a zero-knowledge identification protocol, such as may be used for high-school students.

Flip a fair coin and construct the corresponding transcript. Give this to Bob and get his coin flip. If this is the same, append the transcript to the list and proceed to the next round.
