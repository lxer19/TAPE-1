Abstract: In this paper, we propose a flooding method, called Switch-Aided Flooding (SAF), for use in ATM networks. SAF-based protocols take advantage of hardware-supported cell relay and cell duplication, characteristic of such networks, in order to reduce the time needed to disseminate changes in network topology and resource availability. SAF protocols use a spanning multipoint connection (SMC), which is a hardware-switched network spanning tree, but revert to conventional link-by-link flooding when the spanning MC is unavailable or under construction. Two flooding protocols based on this methodology, as well as an accompanying protocol to construct and maintain the SMC, are described. The results of a simulation study reveal that the proposed flooding protocols deliver network updates several times faster than conventional approaches. Further, the bandwidth consumed by a flooding operation is also significantly reduced.

Reference-contexts: Since signaling must take place 2 prior to the existence of corresponding VCs <ref> [4] </ref>, VC-setup request messages are forwarded and processed in a hop-by-hop manner. Switches along the route of the VC under construction invoke signaling modules to perform functions related to the requested VC, such as routing, call admission control, and resource allocation.

Reference-contexts: In general, these tasks require the knowledge of the present network status, including the topology of the network and the availability of resources. Such information is made available to the signaling modules by the routing protocol, a critical component of ATM networks. ATM networks use link-state routing (LSR) <ref> [5] </ref>, which periodically disseminates status information throughout the network. The local status of each switch, including the status of its incident links, is learned by the rest of the network switches via these link-state advertisements (LSAs). Based on received LSAs, each switch maintains a complete local image of the network. <p> Link-state routing <ref> [5] </ref> is a type of routing protocol that makes complete knowledge of the network available to all switches by means of the flooding of LSAs. LSR was first developed for the use in the ARPANET [5], and it was later accepted by the Internet community in the form of the Open <p> Link-state routing <ref> [5] </ref> is a type of routing protocol that makes complete knowledge of the network available to all switches by means of the flooding of LSAs. LSR was first developed for the use in the ARPANET [5], and it was later accepted by the Internet community in the form of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol [7]. LSR also is expected to be included in the ATM PNNI (Private Network-to-Network Interface) standard. <p> we may conclude that a good heuristic would be to use the BE-SAF protocol for periodic flooding, but to invoke conventional flooding or the basic SAF protocol for the dissemination of event LSAs. 23 6 Related Work The conventional flooding protocol described in this work was first used in ARPANET <ref> [5] </ref>. Flooding robustness issues and possible remedies are described in [20]. These measures can also be applied to the SAF protocols. If network status values comprise simple ON/OFF states, it is possible to design LSR protocols that do not rely on periodic flooding [21, 22].

Reference-contexts: A fast and efficient flooding protocol can lead to better routing decisions by reducing reaction time to faulty network components and congested areas. This in turn reduces the probability of call blocking. Furthermore, protocols for constructing and maintaining multipoint connections, which disseminate group membership advertisements <ref> [6] </ref>, can also benefit from efficient flooding protocols. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews link-state routing protocols and MC issues in ATM networks. A protocol that constructs and maintains a network-wide spanning MC is presented in Section 3. <p> However, ATM networks must disseminate the availability of network resources at a high rate for the purpose of accurate call admission control. This requirement forces the use of periodic flooding and emphasizes the importance of efficient flooding protocols. Extensions to LSR have been proposed to support multicast communication <ref> [6] </ref>, generic MC protocols [10, 11], group address management [6, 9], and so forth. These extensions introduce new types of advertisements, such as group membership advertisements [6, 9], MC topology advertisements [10], and MC-to-server binding advertisements [11]. <p> This requirement forces the use of periodic flooding and emphasizes the importance of efficient flooding protocols.

We re-emphasize that the SAF protocols are independent of the particular SMC protocol used.

Reference-contexts: The selection by x will be referred to as c x , and the computation denoted by C (G; x). (Although core selections may differ temporarily due to network delays, it can be shown that, if the network is not permanently partitioned, the switches will reach consensus <ref> [16] </ref>.) Next, each switch tries to establish a connection to its choice of core node. For a switch x to reach its core selection c x , the switch sends a reach core request one hop towards the core, according to an x-to-c x shortest path computed locally.

Reference-contexts: For example, although it is possible for C (G; x) to choose the topological center of G as the core, a more straightforward alternative is simply to use a least numbered/addressed switch that is reachable from x. It is shown in <ref> [17] </ref> that delays of core-based trees with arbitrary choices of core node (for example, the least numbered node) are within constant factor 2 of the delay incurred by an optimal tree topology, whose computation is NP-complete. 4 The SAF Protocols An SAF protocol is an extension to the conventional flooding protocol.

Reference-contexts: Besides the bandwidth benefit, the use of dummy forwarding might also reduce ATM protocol overhead during link-by-link forwarding; researchers have reported that the ATM protocol overhead of one-cell packets (such as LSA dummies) can be dramatically reduced if these packets are treated as a special case <ref> [19] </ref>. We conclude that the BE-SAF protocol is the best choice for periodic flooding during normal network operation. On the other hand, the worst-case behavior of the BE-SAF protocol is worst among the three flooding alternatives.
