Abstract: In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a 190-MHz pipelined 4-Kbyte instruction and data cache. The caches are designed in 1.0-mm CMOS and measure 0.78 x 0.47 cm 2 . This paper describes the microarchitecture, cache timing, circuit implementation, and layout of both the instruction and the data cache. The key features of these caches are pipelined execution and the use of dynamic single-phase clock logic. We discuss the interface of this cache with the processor core and the off-chip controller. This paper also describes the pipelined structure of the cache and the miss detection and handling logic.

SIMULATION RESULTS We ran a switch-level simulation and a circuit-level simulation on the entire cache circuitry using Irsim and CAzM, respectively. CAzM is a table-lookup (Spice-like) circuit simulator. We constructed the instruction and data cache using the Magic <ref> [5] </ref> layout editor and extracted the netlist from the layout. Both the instruction and data cache have approximately 330K transistors. Circuit-level simulation on both caches gives a cycle-time of 5.2ns which corresponds to an operating frequency of 192-MHz.
