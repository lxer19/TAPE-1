Abstract: The recent success of multicast applications such as Internet teleconferencing illustrates the tremendous potential of applications built upon wide-area multicast communication services. A critical issue for such multicast applications and the higher layer protocols that support them is the manner in which packet losses occur within the multicast network. In this paper we present and analyze packet loss data collected via experiments run on 14 multicast-capable hosts at 11 geographically distinct locations in Europe and the US and connected via the MBone. In this work we experimentally and quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal correlation in packet loss among participants in a multicast session. Our results show that there is a significant spatial correlation in loss among the multicast sites. We also find a fairly significant amount of of burst loss (consecutive losses) at a site. We also use these empirical measurements to derive a Markov chain characterization of temporal loss correlation.
