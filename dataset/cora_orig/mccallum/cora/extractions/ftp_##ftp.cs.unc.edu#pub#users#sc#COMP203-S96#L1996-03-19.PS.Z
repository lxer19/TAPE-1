Abstract: We can think of parallel systems as "distributing the computation (problem) among systems" and distributed systems as "computing using (working with) geographically distributed systems". The subject of parallel computing finds algorithms to efficiently divide the given problem to be assigned to different systems and solve the problem faster. The theory of distributed computing solves the problem of managing distributed resources, like congestion in the network and network protocols, problems in shared resources like distributed file system, concurrency control, fault tolerance, and various other issues related to geographically distributed systems. We will discuss some of the distributed computing issues in the following lectures. * It abides by the results of Heisenberg'scat in a box problem. If you want to know whether the cat is sleeping in the box, you have to open the box and disturb the cat. So you cannot find the exact state of the cat. Likewise, to get the "correct" time of the other system, you have to spend some time. So we cannot get the exact time in the other system, if the time elapsed cannot be accurately determined. But the actual problems in the distributed systems are made simpler by the fact that they require just the relative position of events in the time scale. Further, in general, the time scale is considered to be monotonically increasing for a particular frame of reference. So though some time elapses in getting the exact time, we can determine the relative position of the event of "receiving the requested message" to the event of "stamp of exact time", if both the events are in common time reference frame.
