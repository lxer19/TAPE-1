Abstract: Starting with a likelihood or preference order on worlds, we extend it to a likelihood ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way, and examine the resulting logic. Lewis earlier considered such a notion of relative likelihood in the context of studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total preference order on worlds. Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, ' essentially corresponds to '. They provide a complete axiomatization for their logic, and prove that it is equivalent to Lewis' logic. 6 Not surprisingly, an analogue of AX M is also complete for the logic. Further discussion of the logic can be found in <ref> (Bendova & Hajek, 1993) </ref>. We discuss other connections between possibility measures, OCFs, and our logic below, in the context of conditionals. We now turn our attention to conditional logic.

In this paper, we focus on one other interpretation, essentially also considered by Lewis (1973).

Reference-contexts: transitivity: (' 1 ' 2 ) ^ (' 2 ' 3 ) ) (' 1 ' 3 ); and the union property: (' 1 ' 2 ) ^ (' 1 ' 3 ) ) (' 1 (' 2 _ ' 3 )): This latter property is characteristic of possibility logic <ref> (Dubois & Prade, 1990) </ref>. In the partially ordered case, these axioms do not suffice. <p> More generally, if &gt; satisfies the union property, then U &gt; V can be interpreted as meaning that U is much more likely than V . In this sense, the notion of likelihood corresponding to s or -s is closer to possibility <ref> (Dubois & Prade, 1990) </ref> than probability, since the relation "more possible than" satisfies the union property. Note that, in general, 0 does not satisfy the union property. <p> Halpern and Rabin (1987) consider a logic of likelihood where absolute statements about likelihood can be made (' is likely, is somewhat likely, and so on), but there is no notion of relative likelihood. Of course, there are many more quantitative notions of likelihood, such as probability, possibility <ref> (Dubois & Prade, 1990) </ref>, ordinal conditional functions (OCFs) (Spohn, 1988), and Dempster-Shafer belief functions (Shafer, 1976). The ones closest to the relative likelihood considered here are possibility and OCFs.

Reference-contexts: See Appendix A for details. Given Lemma 4.2, we can write ! for both ! and ! 0 . The lemma also allows us to apply the known results for conditional logic to the logic of relative likelihood defined here. In particular, the results of <ref> (Friedman & Halpern, 1994) </ref> show that the validity problem for the logic of Section 3 is co-NP complete, no harder than that of propositional logic, for the case of both partial and total preorders. 8 More recently, ! has been used to capture nonmonotonic default reasoning (Kraus et al., 1990; Boutilier,

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, it is the property captured by this axiom that was isolated in <ref> (Friedman & Halpern, 1997) </ref> as being the key feature needed for a likelihood ordering on sets to be appropriate for doing default reasoning in the spirit of (Kraus et al., 1990). <p> Our interest in the qualitative property stems from the fact that, in a precise sense, it is the property that characterizes s . It first arose in <ref> (Friedman & Halpern, 1997) </ref>, where it was shown to be the key property required of a generalization of probability called plausibility to capture default reasoning. This is discussed in more detail in Section 4. If is a total preorder, then we get further connections between these notions. <p> Lemma 2.8: If &gt; is a modular strict partial order and satisfies the union property, then &gt; is qualitative. Proof: See Appendix A. As shown in <ref> (Friedman & Halpern, 1997) </ref>, there is a connection between nonmonotonic reasoning, conditional logic, and the qualitative property. (This is discussed in Section 4.) This relationship is best understood by considering s , rather than -s or 0 , which is why we focus on s here. <p> Of course, this is just the analogue of the definition of ! in terms of s . Goldszmidt and Pearl (1992) have shown that a similar approach works if we use Spohn's OCFs. These results are clarified and unified in <ref> (Friedman & Halpern, 1997) </ref>. Suppose we start with some mapping Pl of sets to a partially ordered space with minimal element ? (such a mapping is called a plausibility measure in (Friedman & Halpern, 1997)). <p> These results are clarified and unified in <ref> (Friedman & Halpern, 1997) </ref>. Suppose we start with some mapping Pl of sets to a partially ordered space with minimal element ? (such a mapping is called a plausibility measure in (Friedman & Halpern, 1997)). Define ! ' as Pl (') = ? or Pl ( ^ ') &gt; Pl ( ^ :'). <p> Our results show that there are significant differences between the totally ordered and partially ordered case. By focusing on the partially ordered case, we bring out the key role of the qualitative property (Axiom L3), whose connections to conditional logic were already observed in <ref> (Friedman & Halpern, 1997) </ref>. 9.

Reference-contexts: That is, we must show that every formula ' for which it is not the case that :' is provable from AX is satisfiable in some preferential structure M . However, the standard modal logic techniques of constructing a canonical model (see, for example, <ref> (Hughes & Cresswell, 1968) </ref>) do not seem to work in this case. Finding an appropriate partial preorder on worlds is nontrivial. For this we use (part (b) of) Theorem 2.10. See Appendix A for the details.

Thus, by considering preference orders that are partial, we are able to clarify the connections between , !, and default reasoning. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. <p> Since the equivalences are so close to those already in the literature, we omit the proof of this result here. Using these equivalences and results of <ref> (Kraus et al., 1990) </ref>, Daniel Lehmann [private correspondence, 1996] has provided an alternate proof for Theorem 3.1.

To show that a formula in L that is consistent with AX is satisfiable, he first translates it to a formula of conditional logic (using Proposition 4.3).

The original formula is then satisfiable in the same structure. This proof allows us to avoid using Theorem 2.10 altogether.
