Reference-contexts: For the important case in which k = n + 1, several authors ([Gi52], [Ba63], [Ba65], [We68]) have assumed the existence of a proof that the regular arrangement maximizes the mean width. However, we are not aware of any such proof. (It is known, Alexander <ref> [Al77] </ref>, that the regular arrangement of n + 1 points maximizes the width of the inscribed simplex.) The problem 9.10.2 is of interest because of its connection with a problem in communication theory.

Reference-contexts: A similar bound can also be derived for convex bodies that are given by an appropriate oracle. In particular, Applegate & Kannan <ref> [ApK90] </ref> give the following algorithmic Lowner-John-type result for parallelotopes. 6.2.4 There exists an oracle-polynomial-time algorithm which, for any well-bounded body K of R n given by a weak separation oracle, finds a point a and a linear transformation A such that a + A ([1; 1] n ) K a + <p> The following inequality (which is stronger than what was needed in [DyFK89]'s original proof) is taken from [DyF91]; see also [LoS90], <ref> [ApK90] </ref> and [LoS93]. 7.1.2 Let K be a convex body in R n , and let f be a real-valued log-concave function on int (K). <p> body K is contained in any cylinder whose base is the projection of K on the hyperplane orthogonal to some direction u, and whose height in direction u is K's breadth in this direction. [DyFK89]'s polynomial-time randomized algorithm for Expected Volume Computation was subsequently improved in various papers, including [LoS90], <ref> [ApK90] </ref>, [DyF91], [LoS93] and [KaLS94]. One key ingredient for improvements is 7.1.2, while another major improvement can be obtained by replacing the "rounding" B n K (n + 1) nB n by the "normalization" [1; 1] n K 2 (n + 1)[1; 1] n ; Applegate & Kannan [ApK90], see 6.2.4. <p> including [LoS90], <ref> [ApK90] </ref>, [DyF91], [LoS93] and [KaLS94].

Reference-contexts: Each polytope P R n admits a V-presentation and also admits an H-presentation, and we refer to [Dy83], [Sw85], [Se87], <ref> [AvF91] </ref>, and [ChHJ92] for algorithms that convert one sort of presentation into the other. <p> For practical computations, 3.2.2 has to be combined with some vertex enumeration technique. Its closeness to the simplex algorithm suggests the use of a reverse search method of Avis & Fukuda <ref> [AvF91] </ref>, which is based on the simplex method with Bland's pivoting rule. As it stands, the volume formula 3.2.2 does not involve triangulation. However, if we interpret it in a polar setting, it becomes clear that we are really dealing with the faces of the simplicial polytope P ffi .

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2.2.3 is due to Tarski (see <ref> [BaT24] </ref>), and it led to the question as to which pairs of nonpolygonal plane bodies are D-equidecomposable. Although the sets in a decomposition need not be measurable, equidecomposability of two plane bodies does imply that the bodies are of equal area. That is a consequence of the following result. <p> The relationship of equidecomposability to volume in R n changes dramatically with the passage from n = 2 to n = 3. That is clear from the following result, which is known as the Banach-Tarski paradox <ref> [BaT24] </ref>. 2.2.6 If X and Y are bounded subsets of R n (with n 3), and each set has nonempty interior, then X and Y are D-equidecomposable.

Reference-contexts: The following theorem is the central result in this context. It is due to Brion [Br88] for rational polytopes, and was later extended to the form stated below by Khovanskii & Puhlikov (1989, unpublished) and Barvinok <ref> [Ba91] </ref>, [Ba93a]. 3.3.2 Let P be an n-polytope, and for each vertex v of P let C v denote the cone v + pos (P v).

Reference-contexts: By results of Dyer [Dy91] for n 4 (see also Zamanskii & Cherkasskii [ZaC83], [ZaC85]) and of Barvinok <ref> [Ba93b] </ref> in general (see also [DyK93]), the number of lattice points of an H- or a V-polytope can be computed in polynomial time when the dimension is fixed. Hence the above approach yields again Theorem 3.1.1 as a corollary. 28 P. GRITZMANN AND V. <p> Application of Theorems 5.1.4, 5.1.5 and 5.1.7 shows that the problem of evaluating G (P ) for integer H-polytopes, integer V-polytopes, or integer S-zonotopes is #P-complete. Recall from Section 3.5 that a recent result of Barvinok <ref> [Ba93b] </ref> shows that in fixed dimension, G (P ) can be computed in polynomial time, see also [DyK93]. 9.2 Zonotopes and Mixture-Management. The typical approach to standard problems in mixture-management models the problem as a linear program by assigning costs to each basic mixture.

Reference-contexts: For some structural properties of triangulations and dissections, and a related bibliography, see Bayer & Lee <ref> [BaL93] </ref>. For a given H-polytope we could, of course, compute all vertices and then proceed just as before. However, we will outline an algorithmically different approach that is based on the fact that linear programming problems can be solved in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: One formula is in terms of the coefficients that appear in the affine functionals defining the affine hull of S and the facets of S. The other formula is in terms of the coordinates of the vertices of the simplex. Like the volume formulas in [LiL90] and <ref> [Be92] </ref>, it may be regarded as a higher-dimensional analogue of the Pythagorean theorem of plane geometry. There are, of course, other classes of bodies or polytopes for which special volume formulas or special methods of computing volumes are known. <p> There are, however, exponentially many summands, and this fact accounts for the hardness of the problem. (See Ben Israel <ref> [Be92] </ref> for a related but different notion of "volume" associated with the determinants of the n fi n submatrices of an n fi r matrix, and for the relevance of his notion to Moore-Penrose inverses of rectangular matrices.) 5.1.7 S-Volume is #P-hard and also #P-easy.

Reference-contexts: In their analysis, Dyer, Frieze & Kannan [DyFK89] use a result of Sinclair & Jerrum [SiJ89] that relates the speed of convergence to the conductance of the chain. With the aid of a geometric interpretation of this quantity and an isoperimetric inequality of B erad, Besson & Gallot <ref> [BeBG85] </ref> on the volume of subsets of smooth Riemannian manifolds with positive curvature, it is shown in [DyFK89] that the Markov chain is, indeed, mixing rapidly enough to yield polynomiality.

Reference-contexts: In this case ^ = j f1gfiR can be expressed in terms of the standard Lagrange interpolation polynomials, and there is a considerable literature on how to choose the interpolation nodes and do the computation in an efficient and numerically stable way; see e.g. <ref> [BeZ65] </ref>, [Sa'74], [Ri75], [Ri90], or [MiM85]; see also 7.2 for a more explicit description of the case r = 2 in terms of Lagrange polynomials.

Reference-contexts: The volume-maximizing arrangement of 8 points was first discovered (as a relative maximum) by computer experimentation (Grace [Gr63]), and was later proved by Berman & Hanes <ref> [BeH70] </ref> to be the maximum. We expect that, as algorithms for volume computation are improved, higher-dimensional analogues of this sort of compute-conjecture-prove development will occur.

Reference-contexts: By a result of Bernsthein <ref> [Be75] </ref> (see also [BuZ88, Chapter 27]) this number depends, if the coefficients c (i) q (q 2 S i ) are chosen generically (i.e. in sufficiently general position), only on the Newton polytopes P i = conv (S i ) of the polynomials, and, more precisely, L (F ) = n!

Reference-contexts: An explicit formula of this kind was given by Betke <ref> [Be'92] </ref> for r = 2 and Schneider [Sc94] in the general case. In order to state Schneider's result (in Theorem 4.2.2) precisely, we need to introduce some notation.

Reference-contexts: a linear transformation A such that a + A ([1; 1] n ) K a + 2 (n + 1)A ([1; 1] n ): While this result has direct applications in the design of improved randomized algorithms for volume computation (see Subsection 8.1), the following result of Betke & Henk <ref> [BeH93] </ref> gives a slightly better approximation error.

Problems similar to those for projections can also be investigated for sections (with some additional constraints in the case of minimizing sections).

Reference-contexts: It goes back (at least) to Hadwiger [Ha55], who used it in the context of the Euler characteristic on the convex ring. It has been applied to volume computation by Bieri & Nef <ref> [BiN83] </ref>, Lawrence [La91] and Khachiyan [Kh88], [Kh89], [Kh93]. The general idea is to "sweep" a hyperplane through a polytope P , keeping track of the changes that occur when the hyperplane sweeps through a vertex. <p> Hence for t hc; v 2 i we obtain V (T ) = i=0 Clearly, this approach can be generalized to arbitrary polytopes, and it yields a volume formula that does not explicitly involve triangulations. This formula was first derived by Bieri & Nef <ref> [BiN83] </ref> (even for more general bounded polyhedral sets); other proofs are due to Lawrence [La91] and Filliman [Fi92]. We will give Lawrence's [La91] statement of the volume formula (under additional restrictions) since it is formulated in terms of the standard ingredients of the simplex tableau of linear programming. <p> However, if we interpret it in a polar setting, it becomes clear that we are really dealing with the faces of the simplicial polytope P ffi . Accordingly, generalization to nonsimple polytopes involves polar triangulation. In fact, for general polytopes P , <ref> [BiN83] </ref> and [La91] suggest a "lexicographic rule" to move from one basis to another, and this is just a particular triangulation of P ffi ; see also Filliman [Fi92, Theorem 1].

Reference-contexts: Note that with the special choice fl 1, Maximum fl-Projection is the problem of lower bounding (the square of) a polytope P 's diameter.

In view of the results of Subsection 5.1, it is not surprising that the variants of Maximum fl-Projection and Minimum fl-Projection that ask for the actual volumes of optimal projections are #P-hard.

Reference-contexts: Subsection 2.2 represents a deviation (but a fascinating one) from our main line of discussion. Much of the material in 2.2 has been treated in books by Boltyanskii <ref> [Bo78] </ref> and Wagon [Wa85]. The material in 2.3-2.5 has been the subject of various books and survey articles, including the book by Hadwiger [Ha57], the survey by McMullen & Schneider [McS83], and a recent handbook article by McMullen [Mc93]. <p> The present subsection states some results on isometry-based elementary approaches to volume and contrasts them later with a result on an affinity-based approach. The most famous result concerning equidissectability involves the group D of isometries. It is the following Bolyai-Gerwien theorem (see [Ge1833], <ref> [Bo78] </ref>, [Wa85]). 2.2.1 Two plane polygons are of equal area if and only if they are D-equidissectable. <p> Several refinements of the Bolyai-Gerwien theorem have been established. For example, rather than using the group of all isometries, it suffices to use translations and half-turns. Also, the pairs (P,Q) of polygons that are equidissectable under translations alone have been characterized by Hadwiger & Glur [HaG51]. (See <ref> [Bo78] </ref> for this and other refinements.) Although the original proof of 2.2.1 was algorithmic in nature, there remain open questions concerning how rapidly, under various hypotheses, 10 P. GRITZMANN AND V. <p> Dehn's necessary conditions (for equidissectability of proper polytopes in 3-space) were extended to n-space by Hadwiger (see <ref> [Bo78] </ref> and [Sa79] for references), and the sufficiency of the extended conditions was proved by Jessen [Je68], [Je72] when n = 4. However, the case of n 5 is still unsettled.

Reference-contexts: Schneider [Sc93] has an excellent treatment of the theory that includes proofs for all the results presented in this section. The starting point for the Brunn-Minkowski theory is the following famous theorem of Minkowski [Mi11] (see <ref> [BoF34] </ref>, [Sa93], [Sc93]): 2.4.1 Let K 1 ; : : : ; K r be convex bodies in R n , and let ~ 1 ; : : : ; ~ r be nonnegative reals. <p> This subsection discusses a specific formula due to Minkowski [Mi11] for the mixed volume of a convex body and n 1 copies of a polytope; see also <ref> [BoF34] </ref> and [Sc93]. <p> i ): Let us mention, as a side remark, that 4.3.1 can be applied to a polytope P of the form P = P 1 + + P n1 ; it then yields a similar representation for V (K; P 1 ; : : : ; P n1 ) (see <ref> [BoF34, p.42] </ref>). Suppose now that P is an H-polytope and that the given presentation is irredundant. This means, in particular, that (not necessarily unit) normal vectors of all facets are given. <p> The same is true for the reverse transformation; see [GrH94]. BASIC PROBLEMS IN COMPUTATIONAL CONVEXITY II 37 4.4 Special convex bodies. There are other formulas and integral representations known for mixed volumes in general or for certain classes of bodies (see e.g. <ref> [BoF34] </ref>, [Ha57], [BuZ88], [Sc93]) whose algorithmic significance seems, however, restricted to very particular cases. In the present subsection we will just mention two explicit formulas for the mixed volumes of a body and a ball or a parallelotope. We begin with the intrinsic volumes of polytopes.

Reference-contexts: Of course, we do not attempt to give a full account of the methods of numerical integration; for general treatments of this subject see any standard monograph, e.g. Stroud [St71] or Davis & Rabinovitz <ref> [DaR84] </ref>. Here we want to concentrate on two main approaches to numerical integration, the (degree d) integration formulas, and the (quasi-) Monte Carlo methods. <p> Thus in order to obtain an integration formula of degree d we have to solve the system Z x q dx = i=1 q of d nonlinear equations in r (d + 1) variables. It is quite easy to see (e.g. <ref> [DaR84, p.366] </ref>) that the system cannot be solved with fewer than n + bd=2c nodes. <p> Under assumptions on f that involve its variation it is possible to derive error estimates for such formulas; see <ref> [DaR84, p.352] </ref>. In the next subsection we will consider this lattice-point approach more closely in the context of (Weak) Volume Computation. Improved quasi-Monte Carlo methods can be obtained by "optimizing" the set of sampling points. <p> Improved quasi-Monte Carlo methods can be obtained by "optimizing" the set of sampling points.

Let us point out in passing that the lattice-point sampling corresponds to a dissection of space into cubes with centers at the lattice points.

Reference-contexts: This result is in striking contrast to the case of V-polytopes (3.1.3) and answers a question of Dyer & Frieze <ref> [DyF88] </ref>. The example given in [La91] is a projective image of the standard cube. <p> Hence, Theorem 5.1.2 does not rule out the possibility that H-Volume is in P and that computing any number of polynomially many digits of V (P ) for H-polytopes P is actually easy. Dyer & Frieze <ref> [DyF88] </ref> showed, however, that both H-Volume and V-Volume are #P-hard, and we are going to describe various hardness proofs that are all geometric in nature; (see also Khachiyan [Kh88], [Kh89], [Kh93]). We begin with H-Volume. <p> This shows that computing the volume of an H-polytope is NP-hard even for polytopes that are intersections of C n with one additional (rational) halfspace.

BASIC PROBLEMS IN COMPUTATIONAL CONVEXITY II 41 5.1.3 The problem of computing the volume of the intersection of the unit cube with a rational halfspace is #P-hard. To prove 5.1.3, [DyF88] use a reduction of the following counting version of 0-1 Knapsack, a problem that is known to be #P-hard; see [GaJ79]. #(0-1 Knapsack). Instance: A positive integer n, a positive integer n-vector a, a positive integer fi. <p> Let us now turn to V-Volume, a problem that, in general, is slightly easier since the volume of V-polytopes is of polynomial size; see 3.1.3. However, as Dyer & Frieze <ref> [DyF88] </ref> show, it is not much easier; see also [Kh89], [Kh93]. 5.1.5 The problem of computing the volume of the convex hull of the regular V-cross-polytope and an additional integer vector is #P-hard. The following proof is due to Khachiyan [Kh89]. <p> GRITZMANN AND V. KLEE However, this problem is closely related to #(0-1 Knapsack) and is in fact #P-complete. It is not known whether the problem of computing the volume of a V-polytope is #P-hard in the strong sense. Dyer & Frieze <ref> [DyF88] </ref> also show that the problem of computing the volume of a V-polytope is #P-easy in the following sense. 5.1.6 Let be any #P-complete problem. <p> It follows from 5.1.6 that for V-polytopes, O can be used to actually compute V (P ), while (due to Theorem 5.1.2) for H-polytopes, V (P ) can only be approximated (yet in a very strong sense). Note, however, that (as remarked in <ref> [DyF88] </ref>) the question remains open as to whether there exist a fixed constant and a polynomial-time algorithm which, given n 2 N and a V- or an H-polytope P , computes a rational number such that (1 )V (P ) (1 + )V (P ): See Subsection 6.3 for some related

[DyFK89]'s polynomial-time randomized algorithm for Expected Volume Computation was subsequently improved in various papers, including [LoS90], [ApK90], <ref> [DyF91] </ref>, [LoS93] and [KaLS94]. One key ingredient for improvements is 7.1.2, while another major improvement can be obtained by replacing the "rounding" B n K (n + 1) nB n by the "normalization" [1; 1] n K 2 (n + 1)[1; 1] n ; Applegate & Kannan [ApK90], see 6.2.4. <p> The key step of the randomized volume-algorithms is to compute a nearly uniform distribution on a body K.

As we have seen, volume computation and even volume approximation is hard when we restrict our algorithms to deterministic ones. The situation changes drastically if we allow randomized algorithms. In fact, Dyer, Frieze & Kannan <ref> [DyFK89] </ref> give a polynomial-time randomized algorithm for relative approximation of the volume of convex bodies that are given by appropriate oracles. The algorithm is a random walk, and its analysis is based on the notion of rapidly mixing Markov chains. <p> This indicates already that we are aiming at "close approximation," and in fact, the main theorem of this section due to Dyer, Frieze & Kannan <ref> [DyFK89] </ref> is as follows. BASIC PROBLEMS IN COMPUTATIONAL CONVEXITY II 53 7.1.1 There is a randomized algorithm for Expected Volume Computation which runs in time that is oracle-polynomial in n, 1=* and log (1=fi). <p> Now, the main step of the algorithm of Dyer, Frieze & Kannan <ref> [DyFK89] </ref> is based on a method for sampling nearly uniformly from within K i . <p> This informal description of the randomized algorithm must of course be rigorously analyzed to determine its complexity. A main question is just how quickly the random walk approximates a "reasonably uniform" distribution. In their analysis, Dyer, Frieze & Kannan <ref> [DyFK89] </ref> use a result of Sinclair & Jerrum [SiJ89] that relates the speed of convergence to the conductance of the chain. <p> With the aid of a geometric interpretation of this quantity and an isoperimetric inequality of B erad, Besson & Gallot [BeBG85] on the volume of subsets of smooth Riemannian manifolds with positive curvature, it is shown in <ref> [DyFK89] </ref> that the Markov chain is, indeed, mixing rapidly enough to yield polynomiality.

Reference-contexts: Note, further, that 4.2.2 can be used to prove 4.2.1, that in fixed dimension, mixed volumes of polytopes can be computed in polynomial time. We close this section with a tractability result of <ref> [DyGH94] </ref> that holds even when the dimension is part of the input. 4.2.3 There is a polynomial time algorithm for checking whether, for given n; r 2 N, (H- or V-) polytpes P 1 ; : : : ; P r of R n , and q = ( 1 ; <p> Theorem 5.1.7 is due to <ref> [DyGH94] </ref>. <p> Task: Determine the mixed volume V (Z 1 ; : : : ; Z n ), where Z i = P n i = 1; : : : ; n. Note that this result, which is due to <ref> [DyGH94] </ref>, is indeed of a different nature than 5.2.1. In fact, each of the Z i is just a rectangular box, and so is Z = P n i=1 Z i . Hence the volume V (Z) = j=1 i=1 ff i;j can be computed very easily. <p> This is in interesting contrast to the hardness result of 5.1.7, where the volume of a sum of segments is hard to compute even though each of their mixed volumes can be computed in polynomial time. As was shown in <ref> [DyGH94] </ref>, 5.2.2 can be extended to show that the #P-hardness persists even if the integers ff i;j have only two different values ff and fi. <p> When this restriction is lifted, even the case r = 2 becomes hard <ref> [DyGH94] </ref>. 5.2.3 The following problem is #P-hard. <p> - nk K 2 ; : : : ; K 2 ) (n + 1) n 2 (n + 1) : Taking the geometric mean of the lower and upper bound and, if necessary, interchanging the roles of K 1 and K 2 , we obtain the following result; see <ref> [DyGH94] </ref>. 6.2.6 There is a polynomial-time algorithm for O (2 n=4 n 5n=8 )-Approximation of all mixed volumes of any two well-bounded bodies K 1 and K 2 given by a weak separation oracle. <p> Furthermore, in the special case of mixed volumes of two bodies an appropriate "scaling" can be utilized, <ref> [DyGH94] </ref>. 6.2.7 For any pair K 1 , K 2 of well-bounded bodies given by a weak separation oracle and for any k = 1; : : : ; n one can construct in polynomial time an affine transformation ff and a positive rational scaling factor such that the mixed volumes <p> Now that we have a randomized polynomial-time algorithm at hand for solving Expected Volume Computation, it is natural to try to use it for devising a similar procedure for mixed volumes. This subsection will outline such an approach of <ref> [DyGH94] </ref>. Let us begin with the case of two centered well-bounded bodies K 1 and K 2 that are given by weak membership oracles. <p> As we have already mentioned at the end of Subsection 6.2, it turns out, though, that there are still major obstacles to extending Theorem 4.1.1 to randomized relative volume approximation, and before we state the results of <ref> [DyGH94] </ref> we want to point out what the additional problems are. As we have seen in Subsection 4.1, computing the coefficients of a polynomial from some of its values can in principle be done by numerical differentiation. <p> This means, in order to bound the relative error of the approximation ^ k of k we need to be able to bound the right-hand side in terms of k . Unfortunately, as is pointed out in <ref> [DyGH94] </ref>, max k=0;:::;n (~ k ) P n j=0 jfi ij j grows exponentially, and that is why only a certain portion of the coefficients may become approximable by such an approach. (Recall that the randomized volume algorithm is polynomial in 1=* but exponential in log (1=*).) Hence we introduce a <p> Task: Determine for each nonnegative integer i with i (n) a positive rational random variable ^t i such that prob fi fi ^t i 1 fi fi * 1 fi: Then <ref> [DyGH94] </ref> prove the following theorem. 7.2.1 Let : N 0 ! N 0 with (n) n for every n 2 N 0 , and suppose that (n) log (n) = o (log n): Then there is a randomized algorithm for Expected -Mixed Volume Computation which runs in time that is oracle-polynomial <p> Without such a scaling, one has to resort to the "well-boundedness" parameters r k ; R k that come as bounds for the inradius and the circumradius of the bodies. Unfortunately, these parameters may be exponentially large, and this feeds into the recursion. However, <ref> [DyGH94] </ref> show that one can approximate the mixed volumes for any fixed r in polynomial time, where each of the first r 1 sets may be repeated up to o (log n= log log n) times. <p> The applications 9.3-9.5 and part of 9.9 were 64 P.

As we have seen already in Subsection 3.5, there is a close connection between Volume Computation and counting lattice points. Here we show how a "mixed-volume-like" approach to lattice-point enumeration can be used to deduce some complexity results. <p> It follows, for instance, from the results stated in Subsection 7.2 that one can approximate the permanent of matrices with positive integer entries of quasi-polynomial size, at least if they have the property that all but n o (log n= log log n) of the rows are identical, see <ref> [DyGH94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: By results of Dyer [Dy91] for n 4 (see also Zamanskii & Cherkasskii [ZaC83], [ZaC85]) and of Barvinok [Ba93b] in general (see also <ref> [DyK93] </ref>), the number of lattice points of an H- or a V-polytope can be computed in polynomial time when the dimension is fixed. Hence the above approach yields again Theorem 3.1.1 as a corollary. 28 P.

The typical approach to standard problems in mixture-management models the problem as a linear program by assigning costs to each basic mixture.

The problem of constructing triangulations of V-polytopes is intimately related to the task of computing the face-lattice of the convex hull of a given finite point set, and this is a fundamental task in computational geometry; see Edelsbrunner <ref> [Ed87] </ref>, [Ed93] and Chazelle [Ch93]. The incremental method, a paradigmatic procedure in computational geometry, uses the beneath-beyond approach that goes back to Gr unbaum [Gr67, p.78]. 16 P. GRITZMANN AND V. <p> This requires the use of an ordering of the input vectors. The following algorithm is based on a convex hull algorithm due to Seidel [Se91], and can also be found in <ref> [Ed87] </ref> and [Ed93]. <p> Let us mention in passing that triangulations with special properties are studied prominently in computational geometry, see <ref> [Ed87] </ref>, [Ed93]. A particular class of triangulations that has received a lot of attention because of its wide range of applications is the class of Delauney-triangulations that are "dual" to the Voronoi-diagrams.

Reference-contexts: An essential tool in his proof was the Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequality 2.4.3 for mixed volumes. Knuth [Kn81] later gave a relatively elementary, self-contained proof of Egorychev's result, and it turned out that Falikman <ref> [Fa81] </ref> had independently proved the conjecture (but not the uniqueness) by different methods. Nevertheless, we believe that mixed volumes will continue to be a useful tool in dealing with specific problems that may at first not appear to have any connection with mixed volumes.

Reference-contexts: This formula was first derived by Bieri & Nef [BiN83] (even for more general bounded polyhedral sets); other proofs are due to Lawrence [La91] and Filliman <ref> [Fi92] </ref>. We will give Lawrence's [La91] statement of the volume formula (under additional restrictions) since it is formulated in terms of the standard ingredients of the simplex tableau of linear programming. Later we will comment on some generalizations. <p> Accordingly, generalization to nonsimple polytopes involves polar triangulation. In fact, for general polytopes P , [BiN83] and [La91] suggest a "lexicographic rule" to move from one basis to another, and this is just a particular triangulation of P ffi ; see also Filliman <ref> [Fi92, Theorem 1] </ref>. As an application of formula 3.2.2, Lawrence [La91] derives the following negative result for the binary size of V (P ) for H-polytopes P . 3.2.3 The binary size of the volume of H-polytopes is in general not bounded above by a polynomial in L. <p> Extensions of these and other results can be found in [BuGK94a].

Reference-contexts: The typical approach to standard problems in mixture-management models the problem as a linear program by assigning costs to each basic mixture. However, Girad & Valentin <ref> [GiV89] </ref> remark that for many applications in the petroleum industry the cost of these basic mixtures are essentially identical, and this accounts for the fact that the linear programming model may not always be the best one. They propose an approach that involves zonotopes. <p> Then the objective for the seller is to maximize the volume of the zonotope Z (l) that is the set of all mixtures that are still possible after the current demand b has been satisfied by the choice l. This maximization criterion was suggested in <ref> [GiV89] </ref>. Of course, the volume of Z (l) = P m i=1 [0; 1](1 i )z i is a homogenous polynomial in the (1 i )'s, and its nth root is concave by the Brunn-Minkowski theorem 2.4.4. <p> Hence the maximization problem is algorithmically tractable if the computation of function values is easy. However, Theorem 5.1.7 shows that the problem of computing V (Z (l)) is #P-hard. Thus the algorithm suggested by <ref> [GiV89] </ref> is not efficient unless the number n of basic chemicals is small. Note, however, that the randomized algorithm of Theorem 7.1.1 could be used. 9.3 Integration over bodies.

The same is true of the subject of Polyhedral Combinatorics and of the Algorithmic Theory of Polytopes and Convex Bodies; see <ref> [GrK94a] </ref> for a brief survey of these areas and a list of references to related research papers, survey articles and books. <p> This requirement is imposed by prospective applications, particularly in mathematical programming. For the study of algorithmic aspects of convex bodies the binary model is often augmented by additional devices called "oracles"; see Subsection 1.2 and <ref> [GrK94a] </ref>. Some cases of interest do involve other underlying models of computation, but the present paper focuses on aspects of computational convexity for which binary models seem most natural. 1.2 Presentations of polytopes and general convex bodies. <p> Note that with the special choice fl 1, Maximum fl-Projection is the problem of lower bounding (the square of) a polytope P 's diameter. This problem is easy for V-polytopes; however, it is already NP-complete for H- (or S-) parallelotopes, [BoGKL90], [GrK93a]; see also <ref> [GrK94a] </ref>. In view of the results of Subsection 5.1, it is not surprising that the variants of Maximum fl-Projection and Minimum fl-Projection that ask for the actual volumes of optimal projections are #P-hard. However, it turns out that Maximum fl-Projection is hard for other reasons as well.

Reference-contexts: The next formula, a close relative of 3.6.1, expresses the volume of a suitably located simplex in terms of the Gram matrix of inner products of its vertices; see <ref> [GrKL94] </ref> and [Bl53] for proofs of 3.6.2 and a variant of it. 3.6.2 Suppose that S is a j-simplex in R n with 0 2 aff S, and A is the (j + 1) fi n matrix whose rows list the coordinates of the vertices of S. <p> The computation of V (P 1 ); : : : ; V (P k ) is generally more efficient than direct computation of V (P ). The second formula in 3.6.5 appears in <ref> [GrKL94] </ref> for the case in which J and K are both simplices, whence the general formula follows easily for polytopes by dissection and then for general bodies by approximation. 4.

However, since P may have many more vertices than facets, and vice-versa [Mc70] (see also <ref> [Gr67] </ref>, [McS71], [Br83]), it can happen that the minimum size of one sort of presentation is much larger than the minimum size of the other sort. <p> The incremental method, a paradigmatic procedure in computational geometry, uses the beneath-beyond approach that goes back to Gr unbaum <ref> [Gr67, p.78] </ref>. 16 P.

Reference-contexts: Much of the material in 2.2 has been treated in books by Boltyanskii [Bo78] and Wagon [Wa85]. The material in 2.3-2.5 has been the subject of various books and survey articles, including the book by Hadwiger <ref> [Ha57] </ref>, the survey by McMullen & Schneider [McS83], and a recent handbook article by McMullen [Mc93]. For this reason, and also because the present article is concerned mainly with algorithmic aspects, we will be rather brief in this section. <p> Hadwiger <ref> [Ha57, p.47] </ref> showed that two polytopes are G-equidissectable if and only if they are G-equicomplementable. Let S n be a family of subsets of R n . <p> Obviously, if ' is a G-invariant simple valuation on P n and P and Q are G-equidissectable (or G-equicomplementable) then '(P ) = '(Q). Hadwiger <ref> [Ha57] </ref> showed that this leads already to a characterization of G-equidissectability of polytopes. 2.1.1 Two polytopes P and Q are G-equidissectable if and only if '(P ) = '(Q) for all G-invariant simple valuations on P n . 2.2 "Elementary" approaches to volume. <p> Proofs of 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 can be found in the book of Hadwiger <ref> [Ha57] </ref>, in Section 2.1.3 and on pages 79 and 221. Theorem 2.3.4 is also due to Hadwiger [Ha70]. See, in addition, the surveys [McS83] and [Mc93]. It is unknown whether, in 2.3.3, K n can be replaced by P n . 2.4 Mixed volumes. <p> GRITZMANN AND V.

Goodey gives similar examples in arbitrary dimensions. Let us close this section with the famous characterization theorems of Hadwiger <ref> [Ha57, Section 6.1.10] </ref>, showing that the quermassintegrals or intrinsic volumes form a basis for a certain space of valuations. (Recall that the intrinsic volume V i is a continuous valuation, invariant under rigid motions and homogeneous of degree i.) 2.5.2 If ' is a continuous valuation that is invariant under rigid <p> The same is true for the reverse transformation; see [GrH94]. BASIC PROBLEMS IN COMPUTATIONAL CONVEXITY II 37 4.4 Special convex bodies. There are other formulas and integral representations known for mixed volumes in general or for certain classes of bodies (see e.g. [BoF34], <ref> [Ha57] </ref>, [BuZ88], [Sc93]) whose algorithmic significance seems, however, restricted to very particular cases. In the present subsection we will just mention two explicit formulas for the mixed volumes of a body and a ball or a parallelotope. We begin with the intrinsic volumes of polytopes.

[DyFK89]'s polynomial-time randomized algorithm for Expected Volume Computation was subsequently improved in various papers, including [LoS90], [ApK90], [DyF91], [LoS93] and <ref> [KaLS94] </ref>. One key ingredient for improvements is 7.1.2, while another major improvement can be obtained by replacing the "rounding" B n K (n + 1) nB n by the "normalization" [1; 1] n K 2 (n + 1)[1; 1] n ; Applegate & Kannan [ApK90], see 6.2.4. <p> In their extensive study, they achieve the following complexity bound for the second step (after the normalization) of O 1 * log fi Very recently, Kannan, Lov asz & Simonovits <ref> [KaLS94] </ref> gave a further substantial improvement; see [Lo94]. They achieve the currently best known bound where now n enters only in fifth power. Let us close this subsection with a few remarks.

On the other hand, a theorem of Dubins, Hirsch & Karush [DuHK63] implies that a disk and a square cannot be "scissors congruent"; i.e., there is no equidissection (with respect to rigid motions) into pieces which, roughly speaking, could be cut out with a pair of scissors.

Reference-contexts: One formula is in terms of the coefficients that appear in the affine functionals defining the affine hull of S and the facets of S. The other formula is in terms of the coordinates of the vertices of the simplex. Like the volume formulas in <ref> [LiL90] </ref> and [Be92], it may be regarded as a higher-dimensional analogue of the Pythagorean theorem of plane geometry. There are, of course, other classes of bodies or polytopes for which special volume formulas or special methods of computing volumes are known.

Reference-contexts: In order to further illuminate the algorithmic differences between V- and H-polytopes and the difficulties that may be expected in attempting to transfer an algorithmic approach from one sort of presentation to the other, we mention that Linial <ref> [Li86] </ref> has established the #P-completeness (a strong measure of difficulty) of each of the following two problems: Given a positive integer n and an n-dimensional V-polytope P , determine the num ber of facets of P .

A second class of bodies that come with a natural dissection are the zonotopes. Zonotopes can be dissected into parallelotopes, and it is intriguing to try to use these parallelotopes instead of the cubes. Unfortunately, the volumes of the parallelotopes may in general vary 56 P. GRITZMANN AND V.

Reference-contexts: Each polytope P R n admits a V-presentation and also admits an H-presentation, and we refer to [Dy83], [Sw85], [Se87], [AvF91], and [ChHJ92] for algorithms that convert one sort of presentation into the other. However, since P may have many more vertices than facets, and vice-versa <ref> [Mc70] </ref> (see also [Gr67], [McS71], [Br83]), it can happen that the minimum size of one sort of presentation is much larger than the minimum size of the other sort.

For this reason, and also because the present article is concerned mainly with algorithmic aspects, we will be rather brief in this section. More details can be found in the cited references. 2.1 Background and terminology. <p> Equidissectability fails because, although this condition implies equality of volume, proper polytopes of equal volume can fail to be equidissectable (see 2.2.2). A pleasant contrast to these difficulties is provided by the following result (see <ref> [Mc93, p.966] </ref>), which is valid for all n. It is based on volume-preserving affinities rather than on isometries. 2.2.7 Under the group of all volume-preserving affinites of R n , two n-polytopes are equidis-sectable if and only if they are of equal volume. <p> Proofs of 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 can be found in the book of Hadwiger [Ha57], in Section 2.1.3 and on pages 79 and 221.

Using the expansion of V (P 1 + + P r ) into mixed volumes and comparing coefficients, this dissection can be used to obtain a representation for mixed volumes in terms of the volumes V (F 1 + + F r ).

This leads to much closer connections with the optimization problems that arise in a wide variety of disciplines.

Reference-contexts: Of course, we do not attempt to give a full account of the methods of numerical integration; for general treatments of this subject see any standard monograph, e.g. Stroud <ref> [St71] </ref> or Davis & Rabinovitz [DaR84]. Here we want to concentrate on two main approaches to numerical integration, the (degree d) integration formulas, and the (quasi-) Monte Carlo methods. <p> In the next subsection we will consider this lattice-point approach more closely in the context of (Weak) Volume Computation. Improved quasi-Monte Carlo methods can be obtained by "optimizing" the set of sampling points. The error estimates then rely explicitly on measures of equidistribution of the point set; see <ref> [St71, Sections 6.2 and 6.3] </ref>, [DaR84, Section 5.5] and [SpM94]. Let us point out in passing that the lattice-point sampling corresponds to a dissection of space into cubes with centers at the lattice points. <p> Rather than choosing these centers as sampling points one can choose one or more random points in each cube; this leads to the method of stratified sampling, see <ref> [St71, p.209] </ref>. As we will see in Section 7, the general idea of random sampling (when appropriately elaborated, utilizing special properties of convex bodies) does indeed lead to a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for volume computation (and hence also for some special integra tion problems; see Subsection 9.3). <p> It can now be shown (see <ref> [St71, p.55] </ref>, [ChY77], [Ol86]; cf. also 3.4.1) that the interpolation points y 1 ; : : : ; y k can be appropriately specified so as to yield the first case of the following result; the assertion for fixed n but varying r then follows in a standard way. 4.1.1 Whenever

Reference-contexts: Since the volume of the ellipsoid a + A (B n ) can be easily computed, taking the geometric mean of the upper and lower bound in 6.2.2 gives a polynomial-time (n + 1) 3n=4 - approximation to V (K).

It is not known whether a result similar to 6.2.3 can also be obtained for V-polytopes; see [KhT93, p.158]. Now note that, as shown in <ref> [TaKE88] </ref>, an approximation of E 0 of the kind given in Theorem 6.2.3 leads to the following inclusion: a + A (B n ) K a + p fl and hence leads, for every ff &gt; 1, to an (ffn) n=2 -approximation of V (P ) for H-polytopes P .

Reference-contexts: Subsection 2.2 represents a deviation (but a fascinating one) from our main line of discussion. Much of the material in 2.2 has been treated in books by Boltyanskii [Bo78] and Wagon <ref> [Wa85] </ref>. The material in 2.3-2.5 has been the subject of various books and survey articles, including the book by Hadwiger [Ha57], the survey by McMullen & Schneider [McS83], and a recent handbook article by McMullen [Mc93]. <p> The present subsection states some results on isometry-based elementary approaches to volume and contrasts them later with a result on an affinity-based approach. The most famous result concerning equidissectability involves the group D of isometries. It is the following Bolyai-Gerwien theorem (see [Ge1833], [Bo78], <ref> [Wa85] </ref>). 2.2.1 Two plane polygons are of equal area if and only if they are D-equidissectable. <p> In fact, can also be required to multiply properly with respect to all similarity transformations of R 2 . See <ref> [Wa85] </ref> for references to proofs of 2.2.4, and for a discussion of further ramifications of the theorem. Laczkovich [La90] sharpened 2.2.3 as follows. 2.2.5 Any two plane polygons of equal area are equidecomposable under the group of translations. <p> Thus, for example, while it is clear from 2.2.6 that 2.2.4 does not (as stated) extend to R n , it does extend when the group D of all isometries is replaced by the group of translations. See Wagon <ref> [Wa85] </ref> for a survey of the Banach-Tarski paradox and of several other results and problems related to the results stated in this subsection; see also [St79].

Reference-contexts: GRITZMANN AND V. KLEE Let us point out that besides the well-known applications in mathematical programming and combinatorics, there is need for computing or approximating the permanents of certain matrices that arise in particle physics (see Zhu <ref> [Zh93] </ref>). The lack of efficient procedures for this task leads to difficulties in the study of the Bose-Einstein correlation between particles.
