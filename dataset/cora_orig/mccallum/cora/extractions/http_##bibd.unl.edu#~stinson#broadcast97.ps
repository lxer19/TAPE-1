Abstract: Some New Results on Key Distribution Patterns Abstract This paper concerns methods by which a trusted authority can distribute keys and/or broadcast a message over a network, so that each member of a privileged subset of users can compute a specified key or decrypt the broadcast message. Moreover, this is done in such a way that no coalition is able to recover any information on a key or broadcast message they are not supposed to know. The problems are studied using the tools of information theory, so the security provided is unconditional (i.e., not based on any computational assumption). In a recent paper [14], Stinson described a method of constructing key predistribution schemes by combining Mitchell-Piper key distribution patterns with resilient functions; and also presented a construction method for broadcast encryption schemes that combines Fiat-Naor key predistribution schemes with ideal secret sharing schemes. In this paper, we further pursue these two themes, providing several nice applications of these techniques by using combinatorial structures such as orthogonal arrays, perpendicular arrays, Steiner systems and universal hash families. and Broadcast Encryption

Reference-contexts: We construct a (2; 1)-KPS with information rate = 1=4. Here we can take v = 2 and z = 1, so we want an OA (3; n; 2). It is known that there exists an OA ` (3; 4`; 2) for any positive integer ` (see <ref> [8, p. 181] </ref>). If for example, n = 64, then we can take = 16, so m = 16 and q 31. A convenient (small) choice of q might be q = 32. <p> Now, for any prime power Q, it is well-known that there exists an OA 1 (t; Q; Q) for any positive integer t &lt; Q (see, for instance, <ref> [8, p. 181] </ref>). Applying Theorem 5.2, we obtain the following. Corollary 5.3 For any prime power Q and for any positive integer t &lt; Q, there exists a (Q t ; Q 2 ; Q; t 1)-design.

For later use, we define a certain type of set system as follows. An (n; fi; r; )-design is a pair (X; B) such that the following properties are satisfied: 1. jXj = n 2. <p> Let (U ; B) be an (n; fi; r; )-design defined on user set U . The set-up stage is as follows: For each B 2 B, the TA constructs a Fiat-Naor (2 B ; 1)- KPS (see <ref> [9] </ref>) with respect to user set B. <p> Suppose we take Q w 2 log 2 n and t log 2 n: The resulting design is a w-threshold design, and we obtain an OTBES in which (w 2 + n) log 2 n 1 This compares quite favorably with the construction of Fiat and Naor <ref> [9, Theorem 5] </ref> in which wn log 2 n 1 : Our construction is perhaps simpler in that it does not require the prior construction of a perfect hash family (which is accomplished in [9] by means of a probabilistic algorithm). 20 5.5 A Bound on (n; fi; r; )-designs In <p> n) log 2 n 1 This compares quite favorably with the construction of Fiat and Naor [9, Theorem 5] in which wn log 2 n 1 : Our construction is perhaps simpler in that it does not require the prior construction of a perfect hash family (which is accomplished in <ref> [9] </ref> by means of a probabilistic algorithm). 20 5.5 A Bound on (n; fi; r; )-designs In this section, we prove an easy bound on (n; fi; r; )-designs that uses a standard variance technique. Suppose that (X; B) is an (n; fi; r; )-design.

Reference-contexts: As well, in the case of a broadcast scheme, we would like to minimize the size of the broadcast. These aspects of a scheme are measured by information rates. We provide new lower bounds on information rates by finding new applications of two constructions given in Stinson <ref> [14] </ref>. In that paper, there was described a method of constructing key predistribution schemes by combining Mitchell-Piper key distribution patterns with resilient functions; and also a construction method for broadcast encryption schemes that combines Fiat-Naor key predistribution schemes with ideal secret sharing schemes. <p> In this paper, we further pursue these two themes, providing several nice applications of these techniques by using combinatorial structures such as orthogonal arrays, perpendicular arrays, Steiner systems and universal hash families. 1.1 Key Predistribution Schemes We will use the same model as we did in <ref> [14] </ref>. Our model consists of a trusted authority (TA) and a set of users U = f1; 2; : : : ; ng. We assume that the network is a broadcast channel, i.e., it is insecure, and any information transmitted by the TA will be received by every user. <p> The information rate of a KPS is thus defined to be = min log jKj : 1 i n : There have been numerous papers written over the years concerning KPS as defined above; a fairly comprehensive bibliography can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. 2 Key Distribution Patterns One method of constructing KPS uses the elegant idea of a key distribution pattern, due to Mitchell and Piper [11].

Reference-contexts: We construct a (3; 2)- KPS with information rate = 1=16. Here we can take v = 2 and z = 1, so we want an OA (5; n; 2). It is known that there exists an OA 8 (5; 16; 2) (see <ref> [15] </ref>), so we can take = 8 when n = 16. Then m = 8 and q 31. If q = 32, then we get a (3; 2)-KPS for a set of 16 users having key set [GF (32)] 8 , so the resulting key is 40 bits in length.
