Abstract: The implicit yes-vote commit protocol (IYV), proposed for future gigabit-networked distributed databases, reduces the time required to commit a distributed transaction at the expense of independent recovery of failed participant sites. In this paper, we propose a novel coordination scheme for IYV that reduces the window of vulnerability to blocking and minimizes the time required for the sites to become operational after a failure. The new scheme combines the delegation of commitment technique with a timestamp synchronization mechanism. Although this new scheme incurs extra coordination messages and log writes, it enhances the performance of IYV during recovery in the presence of less reliable sites while still maintaining the cost of commit processing during normal processing below that of two-phase commit and its other well known variants.

Reference-contexts: IYV is based on the assumptions that each site employs (1) a strict two-phase locking protocol (2PL) for con-currency control and (2) physical page-level write-ahead logging (WAL) with the undo phase preceding the redo phase for recovery <ref> [2] </ref>. Based on the first assumption, it is not possible for a participant in a transaction's execution to abort the transaction due to a deadlock or seri-alizability violation once all the operations received by the participant have been executed and acknowledged.

Reference-contexts: Although IYV with delegation of commitment employs two coordinators, it is different from disaster recovery protocols where a back-up site records the effects of committed transactions and takes over only when it detects the failure of the primary site (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>). 3.1 IYV with a Commit Coordinator Pro tocol (IYV-WCC) As mentioned above, in this version of IYV, each unreliable coordinator is paired with a more reliable commit coordinator that is responsible for the commit processing of the transactions initiated at the unreliable site.

Given the performance potential of IYV and IYV-WCC, a detailed simulation study of the performance of IYV, IYV-WCC and the three 2PC variants is currently underway.
