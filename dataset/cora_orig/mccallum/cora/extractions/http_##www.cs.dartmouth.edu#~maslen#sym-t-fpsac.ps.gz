Title: THE COMPUTATION OF FOURIER TRANSFORMS ON THE SYMMETRIC GROUP  
Author: DAVID K. MASLEN 
Abstract: This paper introduces new techniques for the efficient computation of Fourier transforms on symmetric groups and their homogeneous spaces. We replace the matrix multiplications in Clausen's algorithm with sums indexed by combinatorial objects that generalize Young tableaux, and write the result in a form similar to Horner's rule. The algorithm we obtain computes the Fourier transform of a function on S n in no more than 3 4 n(n 1) jS n j multiplications and the same number of additions. Analysis of our algorithm leads to several enumerative combinatorial problems that generalize path counting. We describe corresponding results for inverse transforms and transforms on homogeneous spaces.

Fast transforms on the symmetric group In 1930, Alfred Young gave an explicit description of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group, called Young's orthogonal form. Let ff n be a partition of n. <p> The inverse Fourier transform operator is the same as the transpose of a Fourier transform, up to a diagonal matrix (i.e. scaling the inputs by dim jS n =S nk j , see [17]). A well known principle (see <ref> [2] </ref>, Chapter 3) states that the transpose algorithm of an invertible linear algorithm has the same number of operations as the original, so by transposing the algorithms used to prove Theorems 2.1 and 4.1 we obtain Theorem 4.3, which we state without further proof. 10 Theorem 4.3. <p> The use of Gel'fand-Tsetlin bases which generalize Young's orthogonal form, the choice of factorizations for group elements or coset representatives, and the rearrangement of sums similar to Horner's rule are all well known tools for computing Fourier transforms on finite groups <ref> [2] </ref> and compact Lie groups [16]. Together they form the basis for the general `separation of variables' method for constructing Fourier transform algorithms [19] [20]. The construction of the bilinear maps at the end of Section 2 may be generalized to any finite group or semisimple algebra.

Reference-contexts: When i = n, a collection of partitions satisfying (2.10) is equivalent to specifying a pair of standard Young tableaux of the same shape, so V n = A n as desired. On the other hand, by a standard characterization of subalgebras and centralizer algebras (see <ref> [12] </ref> Proposition 2.3.12 for a proof in different notation), we know that the following expressions define isomorphisms of C i and V 1 into C i and A n1 respectively: [P i ] fi;ff = ffi ff n1 ;fi n1 ffi ff i ;fi i P i fi i fi i1 <p> These numbers are a special case of the Kostka numbers [15] and are usually denoted K fffi;(1 jffjjfij ) , although [13] writes k ff=fi;(1 jffjjfij ) . It is easily shown (cf. <ref> [12] </ref> Corollary 2.3.2) that if ff; fi are partitions of i and j respectively, and j k i, then M (ff; fi) = ff k where ff k ranges over all partitions of k.

(ii) Edges only connect adjacent levels, and if two adjacent levels are nonempty, then the bipartite graph, consisting of those two <p> To generalize Lemma 3.2, we need to place some extra conditions on our Bratteli diagrams. Any Bratteli diagram is uniquely associated to a chain of semisimple algebras, called path algebras (see <ref> [12] </ref> 2.3.11). The i th path algebra A i has dimension dim A i = P fi i , where fi i ranges over vertices at level i, and A i contains A i1 as a subalgebra.
