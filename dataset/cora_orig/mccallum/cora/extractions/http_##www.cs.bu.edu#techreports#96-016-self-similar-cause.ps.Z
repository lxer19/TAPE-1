Abstract: Recent measurements of local-area and wide-area traffic have shown that network traffic exhibits variability at a wide range of scales|self-similarity. In this paper, we examine a mechanism that gives rise to self-similar network traffic and present some of its performance implications. The mechanism we study is the transfer of files or messages whose size is drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. We examine its effects through detailed transport-level simulations of multiple TCP streams in an internetwork. First, we show that in a "realistic" client/server network environment|i.e., one with bounded resources and coupling among traffic sources competing for resources|the degree to which file sizes are heavy-tailed can directly determine the degree of traffic self-similarity at the link level. We show that this causal relationship is not significantly affected by changes in network resources (bottleneck bandwidth and buffer capacity), network topology, the influence of cross-traffic, or the distribution of interarrival times. Second, we show that properties of the transport layer play an important role in preserving and modulating this relationship. In particular, the reliable transmission and flow control mechanisms of TCP (Reno, Tahoe, or Vegas) serve to maintain the long-range dependency structure induced by heavy-tailed file size distributions. In contrast, if a non-flow-controlled and unreliable (UDP-based) transport protocol is used, the resulting traffic shows little self-similar characteristics: although still bursty at short time scales, it has little long-range dependence.

A summary of the relative accuracy of these methods on synthetic data sets can be found in [27]. The first method, the variance-time plot, relies on the slowly decaying variance of a self-similar series.

Such scale-invariant variability is in strong contrast to traditional models of network traffic, which show variability at short time scales but are essentially smooth at large time scales. <p> This forms the starting point for our experimental investigations. The relationship between file sizes and self-similar traffic was suggested by the work described in <ref> [9] </ref> which showed that self-similarity in World Wide Web traffic might arise due to the heavy-tailed distribution of file sizes present in the Web. <p> However, evidence of heavy tails in the distribution of file sizes has been noted in some specific contexts.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, in tandem with showing that file size distribution by itself is sufficient to generate self-similarity, we will see various aspects of the interactions captured in (i)-(iii). 3.2 Simulation set-up We have used the LBNL Network Simulator (ns) as the basis for our simulation environment <ref> [10] </ref>. Ns is an event-driven simulator derived from S. Keshav's REAL network simulator supporting several flavors of TCP (in particular, TCP Reno's congestion control features|Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit/Recovery) and router scheduling algorithms. <p> Although not production TCP code, we have found ns's emulation of TCP satisfactory for the purposes of studying congestion control as well as emulating reliable transport. A test suite description can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. We have modified the distributed version of ns to model our interactive client/server environment. This entailed extending the one-way data flow restriction of a single ns TCP session to full-duplex, and implementing our client/server nodes as separate application layer agents.

Reference-contexts: Stretching-in-time is effected through the joint action of retransmission (or conservation) of lost packets, and the conservative nature of linear-increase/exponential-decrease feedback congestion control <ref> [14] </ref>. This also suggests, in part, why the ON/OFF model has been so successful despite its lack of coupling among traffic sources|a principal effect of interaction among traffic sources in an internetworked environment seems to lie in the generation of lengthy packet trains. <p> The resiliency of reliable communication under self-similar traffic conditions is achieved by stretching a conversation over time so as to reduce the probability of packet loss thus attaining efficient reliable transmission in the sense of Section 3.1. The conservativeness inherent in additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease feedback algorithms including TCP Reno <ref> [14] </ref> suggests that too much time-stretching is already being done, whereas theoretical characterizations on the difficulty of achieving stability and optimality in a rate-controlled dynamic queueing network [25, 17, 21] suggest that perhaps not very much can be done to alleviate this problem in a fundamental way. 4.6 Network performance In

Reference-contexts: This graceful decline in TCP's performance under self-similar loads comes at a cost: a disproportionately increased consumption of buffer space. The sensitive dependence of mean queue length on self-similarity agrees with previous work <ref> [16] </ref> showing that queue length distribution decays more slowly for long-range dependent traffic than for short-range dependent sources. The 1 H-estimates and performance results when an open-loop flow control is active can be found in [20]. <p> both traffic self-similarity and network resources are varied. 2 Related work Since the seminal study of Leland et al.

In the second category are papers that have evaluated the effect of self-similar traffic on idealized or simplified networks <ref> [1, 2, 16, 18] </ref>. These papers shows that long-range dependent traffic is likely to degrade performance. Principal results include the observation that the queue length distribution under self-similar traffic decays much more slowly when compared to short-range-dependent sources (e.g., Poisson). <p> It indicates that, regardless of transport protocol, queue length distribution for highly self-similar traffic is much more slowly decaying than weakly self-similar traffic and Poisson sources which is consistent with the observations made in <ref> [16, 18] </ref>. Same data with the abscissa denoting buffer size instead of ff. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we have shown that self-similarity in network traffic can arise due to a particularly simple cause: the reliable transfer of files drawn from heavy-tailed distributions.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we use two methods for testing self-similarity. 5 These methods are described more fully in [6] and are the same methods used in [15]. A summary of the relative accuracy of these methods on synthetic data sets can be found in <ref> [27] </ref>. The first method, the variance-time plot, relies on the slowly decaying variance of a self-similar series.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recent measurements of local-area and wide-area traffic <ref> [15, 28, 9] </ref> have shown that network traffic exhibits variability at a wide range of scales. Such scale-invariant variability is in strong contrast to traditional models of network traffic, which show variability at short time scales but are essentially smooth at large time scales. <p> Properties of the transport/network layer in the protocol stack, however, will be shown to play an important role with respect to preserving and modulating this causal relationship. The mechanism we propose is motivated by the ON/OFF traffic model described in <ref> [28] </ref>. The ON/OFF model shows that self-similarity can arise in an idealized context with unbounded resources and independent traffic sources as a result of aggregating a large number of ON/OFF traffic streams whose ON or OFF periods are heavy-tailed. <p> The success of the simple ON/OFF model in capturing the characteristics of measured traffic traces <ref> [28] </ref> is surprising given that it ignores interaction among traffic sources contending for network resources which in real networks can be as complicated as the feedback congestion control algorithm of TCP Reno. <p> both traffic self-similarity and network resources are varied. 2 Related work Since the seminal study of Leland et al. [15] which set the groundwork for considering self-similar network traffic as an important modeling and performance evaluation problem, a string of work has appeared dealing with various aspects of traffic self-similarity <ref> [1, 2, 11, 12, 16, 18, 22, 28] </ref>. The research avenues may be broadly classified into two categories. <p> The research avenues may be broadly classified into two categories. In the first category <ref> [11, 12, 15, 22, 28] </ref>, traffic traces from physical network measurements are employed to identify the presence of scale-invariant burstiness, and models are constructed capable of generating synthetic traffic with matching characteristics. These papers show that long-range dependence is an ubiquitous phenomenon encompassing both local-area and wide-area network traffic. <p> In particular, this paper extends and complements the framework set out in <ref> [28] </ref>. In [28], an idealized mechanism was proposed (the "ON/OFF" model) which was shown to be sufficient to generate self-similar time series as a result of the superposition of independent 0/1 renewal processes, each of which alternates between an ON and an OFF state. <p> In particular, this paper extends and complements the framework set out in <ref> [28] </ref>. In [28], an idealized mechanism was proposed (the "ON/OFF" model) which was shown to be sufficient to generate self-similar time series as a result of the superposition of independent 0/1 renewal processes, each of which alternates between an ON and an OFF state. <p> To put this dynamic model into context, we compare it to the ON/OFF model <ref> [28] </ref> which provides theoretical grounding for our approach. The most serious drawback of the ON/OFF model|also the very feature which makes it simple and tractable|is the superposition of independent ON/OFF sources resulting in a linear system which ignores possible interactions among multiple traffic streams. <p> As a result, although the traffic patterns are very different, the mean offered load 4 on the network is the same in all plots. Following <ref> [15, 28] </ref>, these plots depict visually when self-similarity is present (or absent) in a time series, and they show how file size distribution can affect traffic burstiness. All plots appear roughly the same in a qualitative sense at the 10 ms level. <p> We have also shown that reliability and flow control mechanisms in the transport layer of the protocol stack give rise to a traffic-shaping effect that preserves self-similarity in network traffic. This helps explain why the ON/OFF model <ref> [28] </ref>, in spite of ignoring traffic interactions through resource limitations and feedback control, may have been successful in modeling observed traffic characteristics.

Reference-contexts: Bottom: Relative frequency without weighting by file size. 4.3.1 Idle time distribution: Exponential vs. Pareto As noted earlier, all the runs so far were obtained with an exponential idle time distribution with mean 600 msec. Consistent with recent results reported in <ref> [29] </ref> we have found that in our simulations a heavy-tailed idle time distribution is not needed: a heavy-tailed file size distribution by itself is sufficient to produce self-similarity.
