Abstract: This paper addresses the coordination of traffic-responsive traffic signal controllers using an iterative process called ALLONS-I. It determines an equilibrium set of control policies for traffic-responsive signal controllers on a traffic network. This iterative method is a dynamic adjustment process that is successful in converging to a set of coordinated traffic signals in some cases; its convergence properties are analyzed using a game-theoretic model. The result of this analysis is a proof of convergence for a specific class of traffic networks and traffic demand using a traffic-responsive signal control scheme like ALLONS-D.

Reference-contexts: intersections, we associate an intersection's strategy with just one phase of traffic in addition to the constraint that the intersection optimize for vehicles traveling on that phase only. (There is precedence for this based on what traffic engineers currently do in the process of "coordinating" intersections [8]). 1 See Bazzan <ref> [5] </ref> for further discussion. 3 Consider, for example, an arterial network in carry more traffic than any of the N-S minor roads.

We define a game to consist of intersections in a traffic network.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the minor road traffic is not considered at all. Instead, only the complementary flows through the E-W phases (along the major road) are considered. In this paper, the problem of coordinated traffic signal control is first formulated as a non-cooperative game <ref> [9] </ref>. A Nash equilibrium is sought for the game theoretic formulation that is provided. An iterative scheme is constructed as a solution mechanism for the Nash equilibrium by allowing players to act and react to each others decisions. <p> In x 4, an analytic model is developed; it uses game-theoretic notions in order to understand the convergence properties of the ALLONS-I process or any other similar process. In this section, the problem of coordinated traffic signal control is formulated as a non-cooperative game <ref> [9] </ref> and a dynamic adjustment process is constructed in x 5 as a means to determine an equilibrium of this game.

In x 7, the strategies of the game players are constructed as a complete lattice. Using the concepts formally defined in x 8, we show how this lattice is used as a partially ordered set of signal policies or strategies. <p> We must also say that components of a particular strategy are complements amongst themselves. This requires that the performance index exhibit the supermodularity property; this property would be automatically satisfied if the strategy were represented by a single component. Supermodularity also has a weaker form called quasi-supermodularity. Quoting from <ref> [14] </ref>: "Quasi-supermodularity expresses a weak kind of complementarity between the [components of a strategy]; if an increase in some subset of the [components] is desirable at some level of the remaining [components], it will remain desirable as the remaining [components] increase."

Reference-contexts: The last part is a backtracking procedure. This algorithm is constrained only by maximum and minimum green times per phase and is free to consider cyclic and non-cyclic signal plans alike. The rolling horizon concept <ref> [15] </ref> is used for the calculation and implementation of optimal signal plans. The ALLONS-D decentralized architecture consists of one signal controller at each intersection of the network which attempts to minimize the aggregate delay at all approaches to that intersection.

Such a representation of arrivals is not new as it is described by Beckmann et al. <ref> [23] </ref>. For this case, a signal policy and the flow into and out of an intersection are thus specified identically. We assume that the value for flow and green time are coincident.

Reference-contexts: For convenience, we exercise the first option. An alternative is to consider minimizing a cost function. Delay is an ideal candidate in general. For traffic networks, there are many different types and interpretations of delay: Queue Size, Number of Stops, Travel Time and Stopped Time <ref> [24] </ref> are all potential measures of effectiveness (MOE's) that would be intuitive to minimize. 15 For obvious reasons, we refer to (2) as the cumulative representation of i and f i .

Reference-contexts: As described in the previous section, a player's strategy is complex; it is multidimensional and not quantified by a single scalar value. For such strategies, the increasing differences 7 This is referred to as isotone differences by Topkis <ref> [29, p.773] </ref> and others. 20 property alone is not sufficient for establishing strategic complementarity among the players' strategies. We must also say that components of a particular strategy are complements amongst themselves. <p> a weak kind of complementarity between the [components of a strategy]; if an increase in some subset of the [components] is desirable at some level of the remaining [components], it will remain desirable as the remaining [components] increase." We can now define Supermodular Games which were initially described by Topkis <ref> [29, 30] </ref> as games in which the strategic complementarity condition exists. As described by Fudenberg and Tirole [13, page 491] a supermodular game is such that the performance index has increasing differences and is supermodular over the players' strategies. <p> It is important to note that none of the results described thus far rely on convexity or differentiability in resolving the existence of equilibria or convergence of certain iterative processes. In summary, this research relies on results for a class of non-cooperative supermodular games developed by Topkis <ref> [29] </ref>. Further results by Vives [32] are relied upon as a solution mechanism for such games.

Vives considers such a family resulting from a Cournot-t^atonnement process. Prior to the work of Vives, Lippman <ref> [31] </ref> defined this process as iterated play. 21 7 Lattice with Maximum Green Time Constraints The description of a monotone nondecreasing best response mapping (see Definition 6) implies that some order exists among the set of strategies available to a player.

Reference-contexts: In summary, this research relies on results for a class of non-cooperative supermodular games developed by Topkis [29]. Further results by Vives <ref> [32] </ref> are relied upon as a solution mechanism for such games. <p> Theorem 3 The mapping i is monotone nondecreasing in f , 8 i. Proof. Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 provide the satisfying conditions of the Monotonicity The orem (Theorem 2) to claim that i is monotone nondecreasing 8i. Q:E:D:2 A theorem by Vives <ref> [32, p. 308, Theorem 3.1] </ref> shows that i (f i ) is a lattice given that H2 is supermodular. Hence it has a greatest lower bound and least upper bound. Let i be 31 the least upper bound. <p> The following theorem follows Vives <ref> [32, Theorem 5.1 pp. 313-314] </ref> and is the major result of this work. Theorem 7 The Cournot-t^atonnement process specified in (16) converges monotonically to an equilibrium point in a finite number of iterations. Proof. <p> The results are the same when considering the case of the increasing sequence in (35). Q:E:D:2 Remark 5 In contrast to the more general result in Vives <ref> [32, Theorem 5.1 pp. 313-314] </ref>, continuity conditions on the performance index are not necessary in Theorem 7 due to the finiteness of the set of strategies P2 jN j .

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that supermodularity implies quasi-supermodularity and increasing differences implies the single crossing property [14]. 27 Definition 13 <ref> [33, p.1264] </ref> Supermodular Games are defined as games where: 1. the strategy space is a complete lattice; 2. the payoff for a player is upper semi-continuous in its strategy (with strategies of opposing players fixed) and upper semi-continuous in opposing players' strategies (with its strategy fixed); 3. the payoff function is
