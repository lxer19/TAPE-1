Abstract: Case-based reasoning research on indexing and retrieval focuses primarily on developing specific retrieval criteria, rather than on developing mechanisms by which such criteria can be learned as needed. This paper presents a framework for learning to refine indexing criteria by introspective reasoning. In our approach, a self-model of desired system performance is used to determine when and how to refine retrieval criteria. We describe the advantages of this approach for focusing learning on useful information even in the absence of explicit processing failures, and support its benefits with experimental results on how an implementation of the model affects performance of a case-based planning system.

Reference-contexts: The approach used here was proposed by Birnbaum et al. <ref> (Birnbaum, Collins, Brand, Freed, Krulwich, & Pryor, 1991) </ref>, who have applied model-based methods to the generation of self-debugging planners in other contexts (Collins, Birnbaum, Krulwich, & Freed, 1993; Birnbaum, Collins, Freed, & Krulwich, 1990). <p> Developing and applying a multi-level model Determining what information to include in the model, and how to structure it, are central issues. In Birnbaum et al.'s proposal <ref> (Birnbaum et al., 1991) </ref>, the model of CBR contains very high-level assertions applicable to the broad class of case-based planners. While such assertions cover a wide range of failures, they are not operational for identifying appropriate repairs for failures.

Reference-contexts: That information is provided to a component that uses the skeletal plans as an outline for guiding reactive execution of the plan by a simulated robot pedestrian, using a Reactive Action Package model of plan execution and monitoring <ref> (Firby, 1989) </ref>. Because execution/evaluation of the plan is done reactively, the final solution may be optimized during execution. Although this project investigates issues in plan execution and integrating high-level planning with a reactive component, those issues are beyond the scope of this paper.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, modeling the refinement of indexing criteria is important for CBR as a cognitive model. For example, psychological experiments have demonstrated a developmental shift in human criteria for determining important features in analogies <ref> (Gentner, 1988) </ref>; children of different ages use different relevance criteria when determining the features to map when applying a story to new circumstances, with older children using deeper features. A central question is how this shift can occur.

Reference-contexts: This effort can be facilitated if each component of the CBR system is developed using similar mechanisms. We have chosen to treat each component of the system itself as a CBR system <ref> (Kolodner & Simpson, 1989) </ref>, allowing the general model of case-based reasoning as a whole to be applied to introspective reasoning and learning about specific sub-components as well.
