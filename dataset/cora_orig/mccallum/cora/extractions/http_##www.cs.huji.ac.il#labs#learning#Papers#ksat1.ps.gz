Abstract: Little is known about the distribution and structure of satisfying assignments of large K-CNF formulae. One interesting feature, observed by numerical simulations, is that for K 2, there is a sharp transition from a phase in which almost all formulae are satisfiable to a phase in which almost all formulae are un-satisfiable, as the ratio ff = M no complete theoretical understanding of this phenomenon for K &gt; 2. In this paper we study the sat-assignment distribution and overlap, of a large random K-CNF formula. In particular, we study analytically the second, third and fourth moments of the number of satisfying assignments and overlap between satisfying assignments. We show that for K &gt; 4 the average overlap between satisfying assignments undergoes a discontinues (first order) transition from a low to high overlap of sat-assignments. This transition occurs at a value of ff which is just below the numerically observed critical value. Similar, higher order, transition occur for higher moments of the distribution for larger K. The transition in the overlap is observed numerically even for N 20.

Reference-contexts: For K = 2 there exist a complete theory of this phenomena, based on the analysis of the known polynomial time algorithm for finding a satisfying assignment <ref> [4] </ref>. Since no such algorithm is known for K &gt; 2 there exist only compelling numerical evidences for the transition [12].

Reference-contexts: Self-averaging again, as often in large random systems, makes this ensemble average overlap to be equal to the typical overlap between satisfying assignments in a single large, random formula. The order parameter is similar to the Edwards-Anderson parameter for random spin systems <ref> [8] </ref>. A remarkable feature of the transition, reveled for the first time by our analysis, is that for K &gt; 4 the average overlap undergoes a discontinuous behavior at a value of ff close to the numerical estimate of the SAT-UNSAT transition.

Reference-contexts: The first moment of the number of satisfying assign ments, i.e. the total number of satisfying assignments of 1 all the K-CNF formulae with N variables and M clauses, divided by the total number of formulae, can easily be evaluated ([5] <ref> [9] </ref>) as, 1 = (1 2 k ) M 2 N : This expression provides a simple upper bound to the threshold of satisfiability, in the limit of large N and M . When the first moment is smaller than 1, the vast majority of formulae are un-satisfiable.

Reference-contexts: This approximation ignores the fluctuations or higher order moments of the ensemble. Indeed, both numerical simulations and analytical results suggest that the transition occurs way before this annealed bound, at least for small values of K <ref> [10] </ref>. To gain better understanding of the SAT-UNSAT transition we investigate the next three moments of the distribution of satisfying assignments and sketch the method for calculating other moments. The higher moments are then used to bound the number of formulae with very large number of satisfying assignments.

Reference-contexts: A K-CNF formula can therefore be regarded as a system of spins with "quenched" randomness induced by the random clauses of the formula <ref> [11] </ref>. The number of constrains increases with the value of ff until conflicts between assignments of variables in different clauses appear ("frustration") and the formula can no longer be satisfied. <p> Since our binary variables have values of 1, a more natural order parameter then the Hamming distance is the overlap between the assignments, i.e., the normalized scalar product of the two assignments q ij = N of ff for K = 2-5 <ref> [11] </ref>.

However, the special structure of K-CNF formulae, which include both local weak constrains ("OR" inside the clauses) and global strong constrains ("AND" of the clauses) make the exact analytical study of the problem rather difficult.
