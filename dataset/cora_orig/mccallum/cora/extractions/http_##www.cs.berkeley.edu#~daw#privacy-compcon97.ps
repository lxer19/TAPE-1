Title: Privacy-enhancing technologies for the Internet  
Author: Ian Goldberg David Wagner Eric Brewer 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California,  
Abstract: The increased use of the Internet for everyday activities is bringing new threats to personal privacy. This paper gives an overview of existing and potential privacy-enhancing technologies for the Internet, as well as motivation and challenges for future work in this field.

Reference-contexts: In any case, abuse management and prevention is likely to remain a central challenge for future anonymity technology. Others have proposed some special-purpose applications for Internet privacy, though implementation experience is somewhat lacking. The Eternity Service <ref> [1] </ref> is designed to provide long-term distribution of controversial anonymous documents, even when the threat model includes govern ments and other powerful parties, but the design has not been implemented and deployed yet.

Reference-contexts: There are many examples of small-scale abuses by officials: a 1992 investigation revealed that IRS employees at just one regional office made hundreds of unauthorized queries into taxpayer databases <ref> [2] </ref>; employees of the Social Security Administration have been known to sell confidential government records for bribes as small as $10 [22]; highly confidential state records of AIDS patients have leaked [3].

Finally, there is very little control or oversight, so an corrupt leader could easily misuse this information to seize and maintain power.

Reference-contexts: The technology for email anonymity took a step forward with the introduction of anonymous remailers. An anonymous remailer can be thought of as a mail server which combines the previous two techniques, but using a computer to automate the header-stripping and resending process <ref> [4, 16, 17, 24] </ref>. There are basically three styles of remailers; we classify remailer technology into types which indicate the level of sophistication and security. The anon.penet.fi (type 0) remailer was perhaps the most famous. It supported anonymous email senders by stripping identifying headers from outbound remailed messages.

Reference-contexts: A number of cautionary examples are available: FBI Director Edgar Hoover had his agency spy on political dissidents, activists, and opponents; the NSA, a secret military surveillance agency, has a long history of spying on domestic targets <ref> [5] </ref>; President Clinton's Democratic administration found themselves with unauthorized secret dossiers on hundreds of Republican opponents in the Filegate scandal. Anonymity is one important form of privacy protection that is often useful.

Reference-contexts: Government is one of the biggest consumers and producers of dossiers of personal information, and as such should be viewed as a potential threat to privacy. The problem is that today's governments have many laws, surveillance agencies, and other tools for extracting private information from the populace <ref> [6] </ref>. Furthermore, a great many government employees have access to this valuable information, so there are bound to be some workers who will abuse it.

Reference-contexts: In short, type I remailers offer greatly improved security over type 0, though they do have some limitations which we will discuss next. 5. Present The newest and most sophisticated remailer technology is the Mixmaster, or type II, remailer <ref> [7, 11] </ref>. They extend the techniques used in a type I remailer to provide enhanced protection against eavesdropping attacks. First, one always uses chaining and encryption at each link of the chain.

Reference-contexts: Finally, anonymous digital cash is another state-of-the-art technology for Internet privacy. As many observers have stressed, electronic commerce will be a driving force for the future of the Internet. Therefore, the emergence of digital commerce solutions with privacy and anonymity protection is very valuable. DigiCash's ecash <ref> [8] </ref> has the strongest privacy protection of any deployed payment systemit uses sophisticated cryptographic protocols to guarantee that the payer's privacy is not compromised by the payment protocol even against a colluding bank and payee.

Reference-contexts: More recently, we have begun to see privacy support for other services as well. The strip identifying headers and resend approach used by remailers has recently been applied to provide anonymity protection for Web browsing as well. Community ConneXion has sponsored the Anonymizer <ref> [9] </ref>, a web proxy that filters out identifying headers and source addresses from the web browser. This allowing users to surf the web anonymously without revealing their identity to web servers.

Reference-contexts: The threat of being tracked down and dealt with by social techniques currently acts as a partial deterrent to would-be intruders, but this would be eroded if they could use Internet tools to hide their identity. We have already seen one major denial of service attack <ref> [10] </ref> where the attacker obscured his IP source address to prevent tracing. Widespread availability of anonymity will mean that site administrators will have to rely more on first-line defenses and direct security measures rather than on the deterrent of tracing.

Reference-contexts: However, the Anonymizer offers rather weak securityno chaining, encryption, log safeguarding, or forward secrecyso its security properties are roughly analogous to those of type 0 remailers. Other implementations have since appeared based on the same approach <ref> [12, 15] </ref>; but technology for anonymous web browsing remains relatively unsophisticated and underdeveloped.

Reference-contexts: Wei Dai has described an architecture that would provide this protection based on a distributed system of anonymizing packet forwarders, analogous to today's remailer network; he called it Pipenet <ref> [13] </ref>. We will use the generic term pipenet for any architecture built along these lines. No complete pipenet design, much less implementation, is available yet.

Several authors have independently attempted to build a system with similar features [26], but because they were unaware of the work of Wei Dai <ref> [14] </ref> and other cypherpunks, their design remains vulnerable to a number of attacks.

Reference-contexts: Due to its simplicity and relatively simple user interface, the anon.penet.fi remailer was the most widely used remailer; sadly, it was shut down recently after being harassed by legal pressure <ref> [18] </ref>. The disadvantage of a anon.penet.fi style (type 0) remailer is that it provides rather weak security. Users must trust it not to reveal their identity when they send email through it. <p> is to have targeted individuals install mail filtering software. (Remailers could also provide destination blocking services, but this raises many thorny issues; the right solution is for the recipient to filter their email.) The effect of this abuse is to place tremendous political and legal pressure on the remailer operator <ref> [18] </ref>. Of course, remailer operators receive no benefit themselves from providing anonymity services to the world, which makes it all the harder to justify spending much time, money, or effort to defend one's remailer.

Reference-contexts: Where the cooperation of others is necessary to ensure personal privacy, the system should not be easily subverted by the mere collusion or compromise of a few participants. We conclude with an important piece of wisdom from the cypherpunks <ref> [19, 20] </ref>. The cypherpunks credo can be roughly paraphrased as privacy through technology, not through legislation. If we can guarantee privacy protection through the laws of mathematics rather than the laws of men and whims of bureaucrats, then we will have made an important contribution to society.

Reference-contexts: With the increasing sophistication in remailer technology, we find that modern remailers have been burdened with a correspondingly complicated and obscure interface. To deal with this unfriendly mess, client programs have sprung up to provide a nicer interface to the remailers. Raph Levien's premail <ref> [21] </ref> is the archetypical example. Even so, using remailers still requires some knowledge; for even greater user-friendliness, we need this support to be integrated into popular mail handling applications.
