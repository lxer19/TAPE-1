Reference-contexts: This technique has been practically used because of its simplicity. However it is not directly connected to any specific mesh quality criterion; moreover it may not remove slivers from three dimensional meshes, and the result may not even remain a valid triangulation <ref> [1, 7] </ref>.

An edge of the triangulation is flipped if the flipping causes sum of its endpoints' degrees decreases by more than two. <p> An iterative steepest-descent algorithm is used to solve the optimal placement problem. However the algorithm has not been proved to be correct. What is the most intriguing and seems to be the most promising method in mesh smoothing is the quasiconvex programming by Amenta, Bern and Eppsitein <ref> [1] </ref>. A quasiconvex programming problem is a generalized linear programming (GLP) problem where all the level sets of the objective functions are convex. <p> The set of quality measures that can be used to construct nested convex families are: 1) volume, 2) altitude, 3) containing sphere, 4) dihedrals, 5) solid angles. SIMPLICIAL MESH GENERATION AND MAINTENANCE 11 Theorem 5.1 (Amenta, Bern and Eppstein <ref> [1] </ref>). In any constant dimensions, the Steiner point placement optimizing each of the above criteria, or a weighted combination of criteria, can be computed in linear time by quasiconvex programming. 6.

We give the following definition of a 2 d -tree analogous to those of a quadtree <ref> [7] </ref> in R 2 and an octree [41] in R 3 . Definition 4.1. A 2 d -tree is a recursive partition of a region into axis-aligned hy-percubes, called cells. One hypercube, the root, covers the entire region. <p> A 2 d -tree is said to be balanced if any edge of all leaf cells is split at most once. First, a fine enough 2 d -tree is constructed over the domain described by such that no leaf cell is crowded <ref> [7, 41] </ref>. Then the leaf cells, either intersecting or not, are triangulated separately. In this case, the vertices of the leaf cells are used as Steiner points. In general, a 2 d -tree triangulation produces near optimal number of Steiner points with bounded aspect ratio. <p> By strengthening the balance condition in the quadtrees and replacing quadtree squares by tiles with projections and indentations, Bern et al. can guarantee that all angles measure between 36 ffi and 80 ffi <ref> [7] </ref>.

Let X be a point set in R d and T be a triangulation that respects X. Then there exists a 2 d -tree triangulation that respects X and has bounded aspect ratio and size O (jT j log A (T )). <p> Moreover, 2 d -tree is an optimal way to reduce the number of simplices of the De-launay triangulation for a given set of points. Theorem 4.3 (Bern, Eppstein and Gilbert <ref> [8] </ref>). Let X be a point set in R d .

Reference-contexts: Generally speaking, a mesh is a finite, fine, and possibly approximate representation of a spatial domain, and more specifically, it consists of a set of non-overlapping elements whose union conforms the domain. Meshes are classified into two categories <ref> [22, 49, 50] </ref>: a) structured meshes, where all elements are hypercube-like (quadrilaterals in 2D and hexahedra in 3D), and b) unstructured meshes, which we call simplicial meshes in the paper and are sometimes referred to as triangulations, where all elements are simplices. <p> The final mesh can be obtained by patching the submeshes at common interfaces of the blocks. The mapping for each block can usually be obtained by solving either an elliptic or a hyperbolic PDE system defined on the hypercube <ref> [49, 22] </ref>. This is the so-called structured mesh generation since the local structure of connectivity is invariant when translating from one mesh point to another. <p> When solving PDE systems, the regularity of structured grids may lead to nice matrix properties of the approximating algebraic equations, which allows fast linear or nonlinear solvers to be used <ref> [22] </ref>. However, the pitfalls of the paradigm are a) decomposing the domain into blocks at the beginning and merging the meshes of all the blocks in the end can be done only heuristically, and may be impossible for domains with complicated shapes [7, 50].

Reference-contexts: Throughout the procedure, the well-shaped simplices as well as the bad-shaped ones always form a conformal Delaunay triangulation of the domain. Therefore, it is also called the advancing-front Delaunay triangulation, whereas other advancing-front mesh generation is devised by using different kind of heuristics to march the front <ref> [36] </ref>. 5. Mesh Maintenance Methodology Efficient mesh maintenance is demanded when adaptation becomes a frequent event as in solving numerical PDEs. The mesh needs to be refined or coarsened (or derefined) when the density requirement changes.

Reference-contexts: However, except for some special cases 1 , such domain description becomes exponentially complicated in terms of spatial dimensionality. To generalize the notion of PSLG in R d , we define a crossing-free flat set (CFFS)[19], or a piecewise linear system as in <ref> [40] </ref>, simply as a set of k-flats, 0 k (d 1), such that the intersection of any two flats is either empty or a common subface of both. A CFFS can be used to describe the boundary faces and interfaces of a domain in R d . <p> Conti, Tomizawa and Yoshii [14] used the 2-4-8-tree, a variation of the octree where a cell is not always partitioned in all three directions, to generate oriented meshes. 4.3.

It's not obvious how to generate a maximal packing for a given spacing function. <p> Letting T be the triangulation with fewest possible triangles shows that T D is within a factor C ff of optimal. Ruppert's Delaunay refinement method can be actually deduced from an (iterative) sphere-packing if we use the notion Voronoi maximality <ref> [40] </ref>, another weakened maximality like the *-maximality used in the oversampling and filtering method. We define a sphere-packing to be Voronoi maximal if no circumcenter of a Delaunay ball can be added. How to extend the Delaunay refinement method to higher dimensions is not known. <p> A simple and commonly used method is bisection [35, 44, 46]. It uses the midpoint of some "long" edges as Steiner points and connect them together and with existing vertices to form a valid triangulation. If the sphere packing method <ref> [40] </ref> is used to generate the original mesh, then the local refinement can be achieved by decrease the spacing function vale locally while still keeping its ff-Lipschitz condition. 10 HAI SHAO 5.2. Coarsening. <p> The mesh is viewed as a graph by its 1-skeleton. An MIS of the graph can be used to form a coarsening. However, repeatedly application of the MIS technique to construct a coarsening hierarchy can degrade the aspect ratio of the meshes <ref> [40] </ref>. Again, we can use the sphere packing technique [40], where the main idea is to construct a new spacing function as desired corresponding to sparser density of the mesh over the domain. Then a conflict graph can be constructed over the original mesh points using the new spacing function. <p> An MIS of the graph can be used to form a coarsening.

Reference-contexts: This is one of the earliest proposed and most popularly used methods in mesh generation. We give the following definition of a 2 d -tree analogous to those of a quadtree [7] in R 2 and an octree <ref> [41] </ref> in R 3 . Definition 4.1. A 2 d -tree is a recursive partition of a region into axis-aligned hy-percubes, called cells. One hypercube, the root, covers the entire region. <p> A 2 d -tree is said to be balanced if any edge of all leaf cells is split at most once. First, a fine enough 2 d -tree is constructed over the domain described by such that no leaf cell is crowded <ref> [7, 41] </ref>. Then the leaf cells, either intersecting or not, are triangulated separately. In this case, the vertices of the leaf cells are used as Steiner points. In general, a 2 d -tree triangulation produces near optimal number of Steiner points with bounded aspect ratio.

Reference-contexts: By strengthening the balance condition in the quadtrees and replacing quadtree squares by tiles with projections and indentations, Bern et al. can guarantee that all angles measure between 36 ffi and 80 ffi [7].

Reference-contexts: For example, two dimensional Delaunay triangulation of a given point set optimizes various quality measures including the smallest angle, the larger circumscribing circle, the largest minimum enclosing circle, and the integral of the gradient squares <ref> [20, 45] </ref>. Moreover, the Delaunay triangulation contains the nearest-neighbors graph and the minimal spanning tree [39]. On the other hand, the Delaunay criterion of a triangulation can be satisfied without much overhead. <p> Otherwise the midpoint of such segment is added. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is used to store the history of the Delaunay triangulation <ref> [17, 32, 45] </ref>, such that the running time for point insertion to the De-launay triangulation is proportional to the logarithm of the size of current Delau-nay triangulation on average.

Reference-contexts: Generally speaking, a mesh is a finite, fine, and possibly approximate representation of a spatial domain, and more specifically, it consists of a set of non-overlapping elements whose union conforms the domain. Meshes are classified into two categories <ref> [22, 49, 50] </ref>: a) structured meshes, where all elements are hypercube-like (quadrilaterals in 2D and hexahedra in 3D), and b) unstructured meshes, which we call simplicial meshes in the paper and are sometimes referred to as triangulations, where all elements are simplices. <p> The final mesh can be obtained by patching the submeshes at common interfaces of the blocks. The mapping for each block can usually be obtained by solving either an elliptic or a hyperbolic PDE system defined on the hypercube <ref> [49, 22] </ref>. This is the so-called structured mesh generation since the local structure of connectivity is invariant when translating from one mesh point to another.

Before we look into different ways of formulating and solving the simplicial (unstructured) meshing problems in the following sections, we first take a brief look at the structured meshing problems. Paradigm for structured mesh generation. <p> However, the pitfalls of the paradigm are a) decomposing the domain into blocks at the beginning and merging the meshes of all the blocks in the end can be done only heuristically, and may be impossible for domains with complicated shapes <ref> [7, 50] </ref>. The current trend in the meshing community has been toward unstructured meshes [7]. 2.

We will use to denote the domain of interest and d its spatial dimensionality.
