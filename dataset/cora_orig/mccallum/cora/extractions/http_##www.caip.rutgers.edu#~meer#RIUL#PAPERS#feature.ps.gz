Abstract: A general technique for the recovery of significant image features is presented. The technique is based on the mean shift algorithm, a simple nonparametric procedure for estimating density gradients. Drawbacks of the current methods (including robust clustering) are avoided. Feature space of any nature can be processed, and as an example, color image segmentation is discussed. The segmentation is completely autonomous, only its class is chosen by the user. Thus, the same program can produce a high quality edge image, or provide, by extracting all the significant colors, a preprocessor for content-based query systems. A 512 fi 512 color image is analyzed in less than 10 seconds on a standard workstation. Gray level images are handled as color images having only the lightness coordinate.

Reference-contexts: The richness of visual information makes bottom-up, solely image driven approaches always prone to errors. To be reliable, the current systems must be large and incorporate numerous ad-hoc procedures, e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>. The paradigms of gray level image segmentation (pixel-based, area-based, edge-based) are also used for color images. In addition, the physics-based methods take into account information about the image formation processes as well. See, for example, the reviews [8, 12].

Reference-contexts: Oversegmentation is the recommended class when the goal of the task is object recognition. Quantization corresponds to the highest resolution. The feature palette contains all the important colors in the image. This segmentation class became important with the spread of image databases, e.g., <ref> [3, 9] </ref>. The full palette, possibly together with the underlying spatial structure, is essential for content-based queries. The proposed color segmentation technique operates in any of the these three classes. The user only chooses the desired class, the specific operating conditions are derived automatically by the program.

Reference-contexts: However, there is no theoretical evidence that an extracted normal cluster necessarily corresponds to a significant image feature. On the contrary, a strong artifact cluster may appear when several features are mapped into partially overlapping regions. Nonparametric density estimation <ref> [4, Chap. 6] </ref> avoids the use of the normality assumption. The two families of methods, Parzen window, and k-nearest neighbors, both require additional input information (type of the kernel, number of neighbors). <p> We conclude that robust feature space analysis requires a reliable procedure for the detection of high density regions. Such a procedure is presented in the next section. 3 Mean Shift Algorithm A simple, nonparametric technique for estimation of the density gradient was proposed in 1975 by Fuku-naga and Hostetler <ref> [4, p. 534] </ref>.

This condition is for sake of clarity only, later will be removed. <p> Then = S x V S x p (x) since the first term term vanishes. The value of the integral is <ref> [4, p. 535] </ref> = p + 2 p (x) or r 2 rp (x) (6) Thus, the mean shift vector, the vector of difference between the local mean and the center of the window, is proportional to the gradient of the probability density at x.

Reference-contexts: A discretized feature space is called an accumulator. Whenever the size of the accumulator cell is not adequate for the data, serious artifacts can appear. The problem was extensively studied in the context of the Hough transform, e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>. Thus, for satisfactory results a feature space should have continuous coordinate system. The content of a continuous feature space can be modeled as a sample from a multivariate, multimodal probability distribution. Note that for real images the number of modes can be very large, of the order of tens.

Reference-contexts: Note that for real images the number of modes can be very large, of the order of tens. The highest density regions correspond to clusters centered on the modes of the underlying probability distribution. Traditional clustering techniques <ref> [6] </ref>, can be used for feature space analysis but they are reliable only if the number of clusters is small and known a priori. Estimating the number of clusters from the data is computationally expensive and not guaranteed to produce satisfactory result.

Reference-contexts: The ellipsoid is inflated to include h points, and the one having the minimum volume provides the MVE estimate. Based on MVE, a robust clustering technique with applications in computer vision was proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>. The data is analyzed under several "resolutions" by applying the MVE estimator repeatedly with h values representing fixed percentages of the data points. The best cluster then corresponds to the h value yielding the highest density inside the minimum volume ellipsoid.

The proposed segmentation technique does not consider the physical processes, it uses only the given image, i.e., a set of RGB vectors. Nevertheless, can be easily extended to incorporate supplementary information about the input. As homogeneity criterion color similarity is used.

Reference-contexts: To be robust, an estimator must tolerate a percentage of outliers, i.e., data points not obeying the underlying distribution 1 of the cluster. Numerous robust techniques were pro-posed <ref> [10, Sec. 7.1] </ref>, and in computer vision the most widely used is the minimum volume ellipsoid (MVE) estimator proposed by Rousseeuw [10, p. 258]. <p> To be robust, an estimator must tolerate a percentage of outliers, i.e., data points not obeying the underlying distribution 1 of the cluster.

Since the data is bimodal with nearby modes, the mode estimator fails and returns a loca tion in the trough. The starting point is marked by the cross at the top of Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The parameters of the mixture are then estimated by minimizing an error criterion.

Reference-contexts: Images are usually stored and displayed in the RGB space. However, to ensure the isotropy of the feature space, a uniform color space with the perceived color differences measured by Euclidean distances should be used. We have chosen the L fl u fl v fl space <ref> [13, Sec. 3.3.9] </ref>, whose coordinates are related to the RGB values by nonlinear transformations. The daylight standard D 65 was used as reference illuminant. The chromatic information is carried by u fl and v fl , while the lightness coordinate L fl can be regarded as the relative brightness. <p> The chromatic information is carried by u fl and v fl , while the lightness coordinate L fl can be regarded as the relative brightness. Psychophysical experiments show that L fl u fl v fl space may not be perfectly isotropic <ref> [13, p. 311] </ref>, however, it was found satisfactory for image understanding applications. The image capture/display operations also introduce deviations which are most often neglected. The steps of color image segmentation are presented below. The acronyms ID and FS stand for image domain and feature space respectively.
