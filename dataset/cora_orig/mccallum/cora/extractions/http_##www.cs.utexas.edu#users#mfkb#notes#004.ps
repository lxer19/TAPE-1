Reference-contexts: They also provide the `units of retraction' for fixing buggy concept descriptions (Working Note 3). This Working Note extends these ideas to the STRIPS-like representation of actions, ie. actions considered as discrete events with preconditions, add, and delete lists <ref> [Fikes et al., 1981] </ref>. As with concepts in general, we have to decide what to model and what to ignore when describing actions.
