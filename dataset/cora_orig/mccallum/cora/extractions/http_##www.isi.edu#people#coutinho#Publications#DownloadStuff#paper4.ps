Title: A PARALLEL ALGORITHM FOR THE EIGENVALUE ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM IN LINEAR SYSTEMS  
Author: Murilo G. Coutinho Amit Bhaya Biswa N. Datta 
Keyword: Observer Matrix Equation, Hessenberg Form.  
Abstract: A parallel algorithm for the eigenvalue assignment problem (EAP) in single-input linear systems is presented. The algorithm is based on solution of the observer matrix equation, and it has a time complexity of O(n 3 =p), where n is the order of the system and p is the number of processors. The algorithm has been implemented on the hypercube parallel computer INTEL iPSC 860, with 8 processors, and expected speed up has been obtained. A comparison of the algorithm with one of the best known sequential algorithms shows the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm, for matrices of large order. This also demonstrates that a parallel algorithm such as the one presented in the paper can substantially ease the computational burden of a sequential algorithm for large systems arising in practical applications such as the design of large space structures, control of power systems, etc. Keywords: Parallel Processing, Eigenvalue Assignment,

Reference-contexts: Here we focus on a specialized parallel algorithm to solve the single input EAP for the case of real and complex eigenvalues with multiplicity greater than or equal to one. Our parallel algorithm is an improvement of the algorithm presented in <ref> [7] </ref>, which uses a sequential approach and therefore has some limitations. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the theory behind the algorithm. The proposed parallel algorithm is presented in detail in Section 3.

Reference-contexts: Both sequential and parallel codes were experimented with for this task, reaching the conclusion that the Hessenberg decomposition using Householder or Givens method <ref> [8] </ref> is an implicitly sequential computation, and therefore these algorithms perform better if executed in a single processor, rather than distributing the computations through several processors.

Reference-contexts: system (A; B) and a set of desired eigenvalues fl = f 1 ; 2 ; . . . ; n g, the first step towards the solution of the EAP is to transform the system to Controller-Hessenberg form (H; ~ B) using orthogonal transformations which can always be done <ref> [18] </ref>. Thus, without loss of generality, the EAP is first solved for the pair (H; ~ B) (we will call this the Hessenberg EAP, HEAP) and then the original solution is retrieved via multiplication by the previously determined orthogonal transformations.
