Title: Reach set computation using optimal control  
Author: Pravin Varaiya

Abstract: Reach set computation is a basic component of many verification and control synthesis procedures. Effective computation schemes are available for discrete systems described by finite state machines and continuous-variable systems described by linear differential inequalities. This paper suggests an approach based on the Pontryagin maximum principle of optimal control theory. The approach is elaborated for linear systems, and it may prove useful for more general continuous-variable systems.

Reference-contexts: That theory (as well as the polyhedral approximations) extends to much more difficult `game' problems. Lastly, the Maximum principle extends to nonlinear systems, _xs = f (x (s); u (s)); and it could be used to `compute' the reach set along the lines suggested here <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Second, instead of approximating via polyhedra, there is a recent theory that carries out approximations via ellipsoids, see <ref> [3] </ref>. That theory (as well as the polyhedral approximations) extends to much more difficult `game' problems. Lastly, the Maximum principle extends to nonlinear systems, _xs = f (x (s); u (s)); and it could be used to `compute' the reach set along the lines suggested here [1].

Linear systems Consider now the special case of (2) where the right hand side depends linearly on x, _x (s) = Ax (s) + u (s); (5) where A is a n fi n matrix and u (s) 2 U .
