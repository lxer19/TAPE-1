Abstract: This paper describes an active attack against the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) which allows a cracker to redirect the TCP stream through his machine thereby permitting him to bypass the protection offered by such a system as a one-time password [SKEY] or ticketing authentication [Kerberos]. The TCP connection is vulnerable to anyone with a TCP packet sniffer and generator located on the path followed by the connection. Some schemes to detect this attack are presented as well as some methods of prevention and some interesting details of the TCP protocol behaviors.

Reference-contexts: It can send data and receive data on behalf of the client. Of course the cracker still has to pass the identification barrier. If the identification is based on trusted hosts (like NFS or rlogin) the cracker has full access to the host's services. Steven M. Bellovin in <ref> [Bellovin89] </ref> also presents how ICMP packets can be used to disable one side of the connection.
