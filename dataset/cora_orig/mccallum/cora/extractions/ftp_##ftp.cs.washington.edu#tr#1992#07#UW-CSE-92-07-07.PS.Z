Title: Non-Uniformities Introduced by Virtual Channel Deadlock Prevention  
Author: Kevin Bolding 
Date: July 21, 1992  
Abstract: A common scheme for preventing deadlock in networks is the virtual channel method of Dally and Seitz [DS87]. Due to the nature of this scheme, an otherwise completely uniform network will have non-uniformities introduced into it. The variations introduce several effects, ranging from limitations on overall network performance to differences in observed network characteristics from node to node and from message to message.

Reference-contexts: These effects combined to reduce the expected performance of the oblivious torus router described in <ref> [BS92] </ref>. A third non-uniformity exists which may present different views of network contention to messages which have different distances between their sources and destinations. <p> Because this increases the complexity of the router significantly, it becomes worthwhile to consider abandoning oblivious routing completely and rely on an adaptive technique to prevent deadlock. Non-minimal adaptive routers such as those presented in <ref> [NS89, BS92, KS90] </ref> prevent deadlock while preserving the node-transitivity of torus networks by relying on local rather than global schemes for preventing deadlock. At the same time, adaptive routing networks allow more flexibility in path selection, making these networks better performers in the presence of uneven network utilization.

Reference-contexts: The number of paths through the low virtual channels is jp c L j = P N1 i=j+1 i. Thus, for a unidirectional ring, the effective buffer size is: B (j) = i=0 max @ i=0 N1 X i A The scheme implemented in designing the torus routing chip <ref> [DS86] </ref> injects all messages (except from node zero) on the low virtual channels. Messages are routed on the low channels until they cross node zero, when they switch to the high virtual channels and continue on them until they reach their destination.

Reference-contexts: A key component of reliability is freedom from deadlock. Many schemes have been introduced which prevent deadlock in general networks, at varying costs in terms of additional buffers and complexity. A particularly interesting scheme is presented by Dally and Seitz <ref> [DS87] </ref> which relies on virtual channels to break dependency cycles in a network. The general scheme is to note where cycles may exist in a network and routing scheme and then to add virtual channels in order to transform the circular dependencies into spirals which are, by nature, acyclic. <p> While open-ended k-ary d-cubes (e.g. meshes and hypercubes) can be made deadlock-free by restricting routing to be oblivious and dimension ordered, this cannot be extended to k-ary d-cubes where the edges are "wrapped around" (e.g. tori). A scheme presented in <ref> [DS87] </ref> achieves deadlock freedom in wrapped-around networks by dividing each physical channel into two virtual channels and restricting the routing to be dimension ordered. <p> This can be thought of as a "slice" of a torus, and since, in dimension-order routing, interactions between dimensions are minimal, the analysis extends to multi-dimensional tori as well. For channel c, jp c j = P N1 The scheme proposed in <ref> [DS87] </ref> routes messages on the high virtual channels if the node number of the source node is less than the destination node, and the low virtual channels otherwise. This results in the "terminal" node being node zero. <p> Fortunately, this problem does not occur in the "Crossing node zero" scheme because all messages at any given node are injected into the same virtual channel. 5 4 Conclusions Although the <ref> [DS87] </ref> scheme provides a simple and efficient method of preventing deadlock in torus networks, it unfortunately introduces non-uniformities in otherwise perfectly uniform networks. The effect of these non-uniformities is quite severe, ranging from differing observed network performance from node to node to a general slowdown of the entire network.
