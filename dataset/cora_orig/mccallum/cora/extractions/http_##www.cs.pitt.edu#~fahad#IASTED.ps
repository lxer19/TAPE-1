Abstract: Supporting connectionless (CL) communication in connection-oriented (CO) ATM networks is a very challenging problem. In this paper we present comparisons between the different CL alternatives, e.g., direct vs. indirect approaches, streaming vs. message modes, and using adaptation layers AAL3/4 vs. AAL5. The direct approach using streaming mode is the most desirable alternative; however, we find that this alternative is not efficiently realized using either AAL3/4 or AAL5. We therefore propose a new ATM adaptation layer protocol, called AAL5 + , which reduces the overall number of CL virtual channels, efficiently solves ATM multicasting problems, and allows for streaming mode operation in the end systems and servers. keywords : ATM; connectionless service; AAL3/4; AAL5; streaming mode.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is the transfer mode chosen by ITU-T to realize the objectives of B-ISDN. In this paper, we assume the reader is familiar with ATM and in particular the ATM adaptation protocols <ref> [1] </ref>. To meet the varying demands of B-ISDN it was decided that ATM be connection-oriented and be based on the use of very small packets called cells.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, even in a pure ATM environment, connec-tionless service results in tremendous bandwidth statistical gains and less overhead for the network and end systems. fl Appeared in proceedings of IASTED Networks '96, Orlando, Florida, Jan. 8-10 1996 ITU-T's recommendation I.364 <ref> [2] </ref> describes a general CL protocol structure based on AAL3/4, but does not address the complexity and limitation of the protocol. A CL service design which is based on AAL3/4 appears in [3]. The resulting design is extremely complex making it very expensive to realize in hardware.
