Reference: <author> classical reasoner. </author> <title> Proofs can be generated using modest human and computational resources. The approach does not search for attacks, but establishes positive guarantees. In the present case, it has suggested ways of strengthening the protocol by adding explicitness. Bull has suggested that the protocol might be modified to distribute session keys between agents that are not adjacent in the request chain. Such variants can probably be analyzed with little difficulty by modifying the existing proof script. </title>
