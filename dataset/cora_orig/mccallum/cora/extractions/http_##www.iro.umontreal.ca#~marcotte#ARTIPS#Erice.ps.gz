Abstract: In recent years, the variational inequality framework has been recognized as a powerful modelling tool in operations research and economics, whenever equilibrium relationships among several agents occur. This interest has prompted researchers to develop efficient algorithms for solving variational inequalities in finite dimensional spaces. In this presentation we will try to assess the advantages and possible drawbacks of variational inequality formulations, focusing on four problems: oligopoly models, traffic assignment, bilevel programming, multicriterion equilibrium. Each topic will be analyzed from the modelling and computational points of view. In particular we will try to assess whether the variational inequality formulations of these models has led to a better understanding of their inner structure and to efficient solution algorithms.

Reference-contexts: A sufficient condition for F to be monotone is that the inverse demand function p be convex (Good-man <ref> [2] </ref>). If this is the case, traditional algorithms can be implemented. T^atonnement processes, for instance the Jacobi scheme, have been suggested by Marcotte [3] and Harker [4].

The situation is modified altogether when additional constraints are taken into account. For instance, Marcotte [7] considered the case of firms shipping their products to demand markets through a congested transportation network.

T^atonnement processes, for instance the Jacobi scheme, have been suggested by Marcotte [3] and Harker <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The convergence proof given in <ref> [4] </ref> requires that the mapping F be strongly monotone. This condition will be satisfied if p is strongly convex or if the c i 's are strongly convex. Furthermore, the parameter t must be less than some threshold value t that depends on the strong monotonicity modulus of F .

Reference-contexts: Let (Q) denote the optimal dual variable associated with the unique constraint of (3.3). Murphy, Sherali and Soyster <ref> [5] </ref> showed that (Q) is a continuous and nonincreasing function of Q and that Q is an equilibrium total output if and only if (Q) = 0. Based on these properties, the authors proposed a binary search algorithm for locating the interval containing the optimal Q-values. <p> As in <ref> [5] </ref>, a zero of (Q) can be located by dichotomic search. Contrary to the function (Q), the function B (Q) is not necessarily monotone decreasing on the entire region R + . <p> On a small five-firm example used in <ref> [5] </ref> our algorithm, coupled with the false position method in its last iterations, could determine the equilibrium production vector to 7 significant digits in 6 iterations. This compares favourably with Murphy's method (7 iterations) and the Jacobi method (20 iterations).

Reference-contexts: Another line of approach, which does not require the functions c i 's and p to be differentiable, is based on the backward reaction correspondence B (Q) = i2I where q i (Q) is the set (interval) of optimal solutions of (3.1)-(3.2). It is shown in Marcotte <ref> [6] </ref> that a quantity Q is an optimal total output only if 0 2 (Q) def Conversely, if 0 2 (Q), any set of outputs fq i (Q)g i2I that satisfies the compatibility equation P i2I q i (Q) = Q yields an equilibrium. <p> As in [5], a zero of (Q) can be located by dichotomic search. Contrary to the function (Q), the function B (Q) is not necessarily monotone decreasing on the entire region R + . However, it has been shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that one can restrict the binary search to an interval where the function B (Q) is decreasing.

Reference-contexts: In the particular case where all functions are affine, a finitely convergent greedy algorithm would be still more efficient (see Marcotte [3]). The situation is modified altogether when additional constraints are taken into account. For instance, Marcotte <ref> [7] </ref> considered the case of firms shipping their products to demand markets through a congested transportation network. Let us associate each firm with an origin node i 2 I of the network, and each demand market k 2 K with a destination node. <p> A better approximation of the cost mapping F is obtained through a partial linearization scheme that leaves unchanged, a la Jacobi, the nonlinear part of F i associated with firm i, for all i in I. On the set of test problems solved in <ref> [7] </ref> the linearization algorithm was preferable, in terms of accuracy and computer time, to the nonlinear approximation, Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel algorithms.

Reference-contexts: All algorithms converged, whenever they did converge, to the same equilibrium solutions which, we conjecture, might be unique. 6 Let us finally mention that, as the number of firms grows, the equilibrium solutions converge to a Wardrop equilibrium on the transportation network (see Haurie and Marcotte <ref> [8] </ref>). Although Wardrop equilibria are not necessarily Cournot-Nash equilibria, this result shows that they can be obtained as limits of the above network oligopoly equilibria.

Reference-contexts: However this algorithm is difficult to extend to the case where F is not a gradient mapping (see Marcotte <ref> [9] </ref> however) and its convergence rate is not good. Researchers have tried to overcome the slow (typically sublinear) order of convergence of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm by working directly in path-flow space.

Reference-contexts: In order to reduce the computational and memory requirements, it is possible, if certain conditions are met, to drop some of the extreme points generated (see Lawphongpanich and Hearn <ref> [10] </ref> for the details).

Reference-contexts: If F is strongly monotone, the mappings C and G are co-coercive and the sequence generated by the rule + = Proj S R ( ffG ()) 8 converges to a solution of the restricted variational inequality (see Marcotte and Zhu <ref> [11] </ref>) provided that the parameter ff be sufficiently small. In practice, the cost mapping is not strongly monotone, but monotone at best.

Reference-contexts: In practice, the cost mapping is not strongly monotone, but monotone at best. Gap-decreasing methods can be adapted to this situation: Newton's direction is a descent direction for the primal gap function (see Marcotte and Dussault <ref> [12] </ref>); the projection = Proj S R ( ffG ()) induces a descent direction for Fukushima's projective gap, provided that the parameter ff be larger than some threshold value ff that can be updated between iterations (see Marcotte and Zhu [13]).

Reference-contexts: direction for the primal gap function (see Marcotte and Dussault [12]); the projection = Proj S R ( ffG ()) induces a descent direction for Fukushima's projective gap, provided that the parameter ff be larger than some threshold value ff that can be updated between iterations (see Marcotte and Zhu <ref> [13] </ref>). Since restriction-based algorithms work in path-flow space, a theoretical challenge consists in devising a limited-memory method operating in arc-flow space.

Reference-contexts: If rF is strongly asymmetric however, the method could zigzag, or even cycle. This could be fixed by using a smaller stepsize, for instance: v l+1 = v l + l This constitutes a generalization of the well-known Brown-Robinson's fictitious play algorithm (see Robinson <ref> [14] </ref>) for solving zero-sum matrix games. We conjecture that it can be used to solve monotone variational inequalities as well. The TAP is by now a well-understood large-scale optimization problem that can be solved by several known methods that are both numerically efficient and theoretically convergent.

Reference-contexts: The main challenge is now the development of algorithms for solving dynamic models of traffic flow. These are best formulated as infinite-dimensional, highly nonmonotone variational inequalities (see Wu <ref> [15] </ref>) for which only heuristic procedures have been proposed yet.

Reference-contexts: Even in the linear case, checking the local optimality of a solution (x; y) is strongly NP-Hard (Hansen, Jaumard and Savard <ref> [16] </ref>). It occurs frequently that the lower level variables are controlled by several, if not infinitely many, agents or players. For instance, the x-variables might represent energy taxes set by the government, and y the industrial sector's reaction to those tax levels. <p> Bilevel programs are computationally intensive. Exact algorithms, based on the implicit enumeration of the lower-level optimal faces, have only been tested on small instances involving linear or quadratic objectives and constraints. Even local optimality results are difficult to obtain (see Hansen, Jaumard and Savard <ref> [16] </ref> and Gauvin and Savard [21]) and the theory of sensitivity analysis for variational inequalities is of no great help, as local optima may be numerous.

Reference-contexts: Even under strong assumptions, the constraint g (x; y) = 0 in (5.2) is nonconvex, and cannot be expected to satisfy any constraint qualification. By penalizing the nonconvex term, one obtains the program min F (x; y) + Kg (x; y): (5.3) Under suitable assumptions (see Marcotte and Zhu <ref> [17] </ref>), this penalty is exact, i.e., there exists a threshold value K such that, for any K K , a global solution of (5.3) is a global solution of (5.2).

Reference-contexts: to u j 0 (5.5) G (x; y) + j2J Under certain conditions, for instance if all functions involved are affine, it can be shown that a solution of (5.5) is globally optimal if and only if it is also globally optimal for (5.4) (see Luo, Pang, Ralph and Wu <ref> [18] </ref>). If the set Y (x) is a compact polyhedron Y = fBy bg independent of x, one can write the bilevel program as min F (x; y) where fy i g i2I is the (finite) set of extreme points of Y .

Reference-contexts: Under suitable assumptions, the variational inequality (5.7) is monotone and can be reduced to a convex optimization problem (see Marcotte and Marquis <ref> [20] </ref>). Bilevel programs are computationally intensive. Exact algorithms, based on the implicit enumeration of the lower-level optimal faces, have only been tested on small instances involving linear or quadratic objectives and constraints.

Reference-contexts: A bicriterion problem One shortcoming of the traffic assignment model presented in the next-to-last section is that it yields nonunique equilibrium path flows, even when arc flows are unique. This can be remedied by considering stochastic versions of the TAP (see Fisk <ref> [22] </ref>), where all paths carry some amount of flow. The larger its cost, the lower will be the amount of flow carried by a given path.

Reference-contexts: The parameter ff is referred to as the "value-of-time" parameter. Following Leurent <ref> [23] </ref>, we assume that the parameter ff varies continuously across the population of network users, and that its density function h (ff) is continuous and strictly positive on [0; 1).

Reference-contexts: This is equivalent, modulo a set of measure zero, (see Dafermos <ref> [24] </ref>) to finding a vector v in and its corresponding total flow vector V = P a satisfying the monotone variational inequality o 1 G; V Y 0 (6.1) for all flow vectors y in compatible with the feasible total flow vector Y .

Reference-contexts: The convergence of the method follows from a result established by Auslender and Brodeau <ref> [25] </ref>. For a current solution vector v and corresponding total flow vector V , the linear subproblem resulting from the linearization of the objective with respect to the flow variables is: min X X (C a (V a ) + G a =ff)y k This problem is separable by commodity.

Reference-contexts: The convergence of the method can be established by adapting a proof of convergence of a gap-decreasing algorithm for solving variational inequalities defined over strongly convex sets (see Auslender <ref> [26] </ref>). In both cases the solution of the linear approximation problem (6.2) is unique. The uniqueness of the correspondence y (V ) has other interesting consequences. In particular, at any equilibrium solution v fl , one has that y (V fl ) = v fl .
