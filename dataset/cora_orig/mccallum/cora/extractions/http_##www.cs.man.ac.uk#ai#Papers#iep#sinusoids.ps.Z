Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a method of representing convexregions of the plane basedon the sinusoidal transform. The sinusoidal transform is a member of the general class of geometrical representation schemes based on a `boundary function'a periodic function of one variable which picks out a bounded region of the plane in terms of the contour that encloses it. Various types of boundary function have been explored in the literature, but one feature they all share is that, being periodic, they can be approximated by a sequence of Fourier coefficients, which therefore serve to represent the original region. The aim of the paper is to obtain a thorough understanding of the sinusoidal transform of its associated Fourier descriptors. We investigate the derivatives of the sinusoidal transform and establish an inverse transform. We obtain a characterization of the set of periodic functions of one variable which are the sinusoidal transforms of `well-behaved' convex regions of the plane. We derive negative results concerning the prospects for extending the sinusoidal representation scheme to non-convex regions. Finallyand of more practical importancewe show how various geometrical quantities and relationsincluding overlap, inclusion, separation, distance, radius of curvature, perimeter length, area and congruencecan be extracted from the sinusoidal transforms of regions,and hence from their sinusoidal Fourier descriptors.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we investigate what happens when we take the boundary function to be the sinusoidal transform (Pratt [6]). This method of representing convex regions is essentially equivalent to the `rotating callipers' method (Toussaint [9]) and to the well-studied and widely-applied Hough- and Radon transforms (Leavers <ref> [4] </ref>). According to this method, a convex region of the plane can be represented by rotating it around the origin and plotting the height (the y-coordinate) of its highest and lowest points over time. Figure 1 shows some convex regions of the plane and their corresponding representations. <p> Many approaches to image processing use representations which are, in effect, sinusoidal hulls or variants thereof. In particular, there is clearly a close relationship between the sinusoidal transform and the Hough transform (see, for example, Leavers <ref> [4] </ref>). However, in this paper, we shall not concern ourselves with the practical difficulties of extracting the sinusoidal transform (or its relatives) from an image. 8 a) b) c) Let us now turn our attention to the significance of the second derivative of the sinusoidal transform, a 00 S (t).

Reference-contexts: Exactly which geometric features of regions can be read off from their representations in terms of Fourier coefficients depends on the type of boundary function used. In this paper, we investigate what happens when we take the boundary function to be the sinusoidal transform (Pratt <ref> [6] </ref>). This method of representing convex regions is essentially equivalent to the `rotating callipers' method (Toussaint [9]) and to the well-studied and widely-applied Hough- and Radon transforms (Leavers [4]).

Reference-contexts: corresponding to these eight directed lines of support. (Geometrically, if we imagine S and T rotating together about the origin, the crossing points occur at times when the lines of support are horizontal.) This correspondence is the basis for the use of sinusoidal hulls for route-planning, as described in Pratt <ref> [8] </ref>. 3 Analysing the sinusoidal transform In this section, we analyse the sinusoidal transform in more detail and lay the groundwork for section 4, where we investigate its inverse.

Reference-contexts: Spatial representation schemes based on similar geometrical ideas have also been proposed as models of spatial representation in animal brains (Touretzky, Redish and Wan <ref> [10] </ref>). However, our concern in this paper is not to apply, or even to recommend, the sinusoidal transform, but rather, to establish its properties. The plan of the paper is as follows. We begin by introducing the sinusoidal transform, explaining its most basic properties.
