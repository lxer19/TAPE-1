Title: Some applications of generalized FFTs  
Author: Daniel N. Rockmore 
Date: 00, 19xx  
Note: DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science Volume  
Abstract: Generalized FFTs are efficient algorithms for computing a Fourier transform of a function defined on finite group, or a bandlimited function defined on a compact group. The development of such algorithms has been accompanied and motivated by a growing number of both potential and realized applications. This paper will attempt to survey some of these applications. Appendices include some more detailed examples.

Reference-contexts: Classically, such data is analyzed by the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for linear models (cf. [91]). The following section summarizes some recent work <ref> [2] </ref> which shows that the classical analysis often can be subsumed by a spectral analysis approach. To begin, some of the notation and terminology of design theory must be recalled. Let D be any incidence structure. <p> This is illustrated in the context of the example of k-sets of a v-set, as studied in <ref> [2] </ref>. Example. The k-sets of a v-set. In order to simplify the analysis assume v 2k and in particular, consider the case of the design of all 4-sets of a v-set where v 8.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm, together with many variants as well as different approaches to computing the DFT, yield a family of techniques (see e.g. [36, 99]) which for any N give an O (N log N ) algorithm for computing the DFT (cf. <ref> [3, 27] </ref>). This speed-up has had tremendous significance, effectively making digital signal processing a reality. The discussions of the previous sections have really only emphasizes the spectral analysis uses of the FFT.

Reference-contexts: For thorough historical overviews see [19, 20, 50]. Recently, there has developed a growing literature related to the construction of algorithms which generalize the FFT from the point of view of the theory of group representations (see e.g., <ref> [5, 17, 18, 29, 82] </ref>). These sorts of generalizations are "natural" as mathematical constructs, but in point of fact, they too have been motivated by applications. For example, the seemingly earliest construction of "nonabelian" FFTs (due to Willsky) was motivated by the search for new efficient filters [102]. <p> A Fourier transform for a finite group G is a change of basis from the basis of point-mass or delta functions for CG to a basis of irreducible matrix coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Using the the fact that P = jGj and d jGj 1=2 , we see that the above is an algorithm which computes convolution in at most 3T (G) + jGj 3=2 operations. Clausen has shown that T (G) jGj 1:44 for any G (cf. <ref> [10] </ref>), so that the above algorithm has a complexity of at most 3jGj 1:44 + jGj 3=2 . In the particular case of abelian groups (all irreducible representations are one-dimensional and T (G) = O (jGj log jGj), this gives an O (jGj log jGj) convolution algorithm. 3.3. Smoothing.

Reference-contexts: In the notation of Section 2.5 The corresponding translation representation is recognized as M (vk+1;k1;1) . Examples of this design can arise in "tasting" data.

This deserves some explanation: From the point of view of the symmetric group, this is intrinsically an ordered space, i.e., it is the "pure" effect of functions defined on ordered pairs in an v-set. However, block designs are intrinsically unordered. The new insight is this.

Reference-contexts: This is the orientation parameter. When this is accomplished, the CMM measurements can then be transformed and checked against the CAD file. Estimation of the orientation parameter permits the estimation of the rotation or error density f * . This is accomplished by using the methods of spherical regression <ref> [12] </ref> to find a least-squares solution to the problem of lining up corresponding sets of CMM directional measurements and CAD reference points. Assuming that the alignment errors then follow a matrix Fisher distribution (cf. [69]), the estimated orientation parameter produces an error distribution with invertible Fourier transforms (cf. [52]).

Reference-contexts: A potential application is to computer vision. The "camera-eye" paradigm analyzes a 3-D scene as an image intensity function defined on a hemisphere. This is meant to model the human vision system as processing an intensity function defined on the retina <ref> [15, 66] </ref> so that f (; ) is the light intensity at the point x (; ) on the retina. Object identification is carried out by convolving a fixed image against the intensity function representing the input scene. The intuitive approach to this problem involves a template matching operation.

Reference-contexts: 1. A brief history The now "classical" Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has a long and interesting history. Originally discovered by Gauss, and later made famous after being rediscovered by Cooley and Tukey <ref> [21] </ref>, it may be viewed as an algorithm which efficiently computes the discrete Fourier transform or DFT. In between Gauss and Cooley-Tukey others developed special cases of the algorithm, usually motivated by the need to make efficient data analysis of one sort or another. <p> To cite but a few examples, Gauss was interested in efficiently interpolating the orbits of asteroids [43]; Danielson and Lanczos were concerned with x-ray diffraction [23]; Yates [103] and Good [47] needed the algorithm for statistics; Cooley and Tukey were interested in efficient time series analysis and digital signal processing <ref> [21] </ref>. For thorough historical overviews see [19, 20, 50]. Recently, there has developed a growing literature related to the construction of algorithms which generalize the FFT from the point of view of the theory of group representations (see e.g., [5, 17, 18, 29, 82]). <p> As N becomes large this cost quickly becomes prohibitive. Cooley and Tukey derived and implemented an algorithm which given a prime factorization of N = p 1 p r , computes the DFT in O (N P i p i ) operations <ref> [21] </ref>. If each p i = 2, this is O (N log 2 N ) operations.

Reference-contexts: The responses give data on 4-sets of a 6-set. A (possibly) more important example comes from medical imaging and the subjective rating of images. In such examples, radiologists may be asked to rate the quality of images of a given object obtained under different image reconstruction algorithms <ref> [22] </ref>. They too may suffer from "taste fatigue" if they view too many pictures. Standard techniques (see e.g. [91]) for analyzing such data amount to computing the projections of the data onto subspaces spanned by sets of functions suggested by the combinatorial structure of the design.

Reference-contexts: The use of generalized FFTs for spectral analysis is in the efficient computation of the projections. Algorithmic details can be found in the papers <ref> [28, 32, 82, 83] </ref> as well as the many references contained therein. The following hopes to elucidate this approach by way of example. First a classical example due to Yates is discussed. <p> Having done this, the lengths of the projections are considered. If a given projection has large relative contribution then it is further investigated by considering some irreducible decomposition of the particular isotypic. The general problem of computation of the isotypic decompositions is discussed in <ref> [28, 82] </ref>. We are interested in the analysis of data of the shape (8; 1; 1; 1). Let f denote the original data vector. Then Table 2 gives the values of f . Let a triple i; j; k denote the choice of i first, j second and k third. <p> Remarks. 1. Computational aspects. For the spectral analysis described above, the main computational component necessary is an efficient algorithm for the computation of the isotypic projections. For this the algorithms described in <ref> [28, 82] </ref> obtain. 2. Other approaches. The above evaluation of the relative interest of the different projections is rather ad hoc.
Reference: [30] <author> P. Diaconis and B. Sturmfels, </author> <title> Algebraic algorithms for sampling from conditional distributions, 1995, </title> <type> (preprint). </type>
Reference-contexts: Another possible approach is to randomly generate data vectors that share some particular characteristics with the data (including the length) to determine if there is anything surprising about the size of a given projection, given these characteristics (cf. <ref> [30] </ref>). This very general guiding principle encompasses various standard approaches to data analysis. A widely studied example is the analysis of time series. <p> For this the algorithms described in [28, 82] obtain. 2. Other approaches. The above evaluation of the relative interest of the different projections is rather ad hoc. As described in <ref> [30] </ref> a more rigorous procedure would take the form of independently generating many data sets from a distribution which is uniform over all data sets with the same first order statistics and consequent computation of a sample distribution of the lengths of the projections of the higher order projections. <p> Comparision of any particular projection from the original data set with the experimentally generated distribution could then be used as an evalutive criterion. In <ref> [30] </ref> Diaconis and Sturmfels show how Grobner bases may be used to efficiently generate the data sets and hence, the subsequent distribution of projection lengths. 32 DANIEL N.

Reference-contexts: The appropriate generalization to other groups and the use of nonabelian filters is then discussed. Of particular interest are the applications of the recently discovered fast convolution algorithm for bandlimited functions on the 2-sphere (cf. <ref> [31, 55, 57] </ref>), which in turn gives rise to the possibility of an efficient matched filter for the sphere. The discovery of an FFT for the 2-sphere by Driscoll and Healy was the first instance of a nonabelian FFT in the continuous setting. <p> In the same spirit, recent investigations have used a variety of different actions of wreath products on a square grid to attempt to pick out rotated and translated versions of fixed patterns [54]. In the continuous setting, the recent discovery of an FFT on the 2-sphere <ref> [31, 57] </ref> makes available the possibility of matched filtering on this surface. This has potential applications in computer vision and CAD. In fact, the FFT on the 2-sphere has a wealth of possible applications and in order to highlight them, they are collected in Appendix B. 4. <p> In [30] Diaconis and Sturmfels show how Grobner bases may be used to efficiently generate the data sets and hence, the subsequent distribution of projection lengths. 32 DANIEL N. ROCKMORE Appendix B. Applications of an FFT on the 2-sphere 1 with Dennis M. Healy Jr. 2 The recent discovery <ref> [31] </ref> and subsequent improvements [57] of a fast algorithm for the computation of spherical harmonic expansions and convolutions of bandlimited functions on the 2-sphere has a wide range of applications. <p> Convolution of integrable functions on S 2 is defined by lifting these functions to right SO (2)-invariant functions on the transitive symmetry group SO (3) and computing the convolution on SO (3) (cf. <ref> [31] </ref>, Section 3). The relation between convolution and the Fourier transform is analogous to the situation in the abelian case (cf. [31], Theorem 1). <p> on S 2 is defined by lifting these functions to right SO (2)-invariant functions on the transitive symmetry group SO (3) and computing the convolution on SO (3) (cf. <ref> [31] </ref>, Section 3). The relation between convolution and the Fourier transform is analogous to the situation in the abelian case (cf. [31], Theorem 1). It is given by the formula d f ? g (`; m) = 2 4 ^ f (`; m) ^ h (`; 0): (26) Of particular interest is the efficient expansion and convolution of band-limited functions, defined as functions which have only a finite Fourier expansion. <p> A function f is said to have bandwidth B if ^ f (`; m) = 0 for all ` B. Notice that a function of bandwidth B has at most N = B 2 nonzero Fourier coefficients. The paper <ref> [31] </ref> gives the first exact (in exact arithmetic) and efficient expansion algorithm, computing the N = B 2 Fourier coefficients in O (N log 2 N ) operations. The accompanying convolution algorithm given there requires O (N 1:5 ) operations. <p> probability densities, this implies that the density of the measured signal is given by the convolution of the true signal density with the density associated with the random rotation. (In fact, the convolution takes place over SO (3), but the Fourier analysis is essentially the same and the algorithms of <ref> [31, 55, 57] </ref> still apply.) Thus, if f Z is the probability density of the measured data Z and f X the density of the underlying signal X and f * the density of the random rotation * of f, then f Z = f * ? f X : Deconvolution

Reference-contexts: In this setting, a standard excellent reference is [85]. The recent book of Steiglitz [95] is a beautiful introduction to filtering from the point of view of computer music. Of primary relevance for this section is the work of Holmes whose papers <ref> [59, 60] </ref> do a great job of giving a group theoretic context to many signal processing constructions, and should be considered required reading for anyone interested in pursuing related research. In some ways, the following can be viewed as an introduction to these papers. 3.2. Convolution. <p> These are suboptimal Weiner filters. The work of Karpovsky and Trachtenberg [67] and Holmes <ref> [59, 60] </ref> indicates that for some classes of stochastic signals, certain DFTs for nonabelian groups may be employed as suboptimal Weiner filters. The construction is quite simple. Suppose that the goals is to estimate some N -dimensional signal. <p> "good" choices of R, that is, choices that give FFTs for G, and structured choices for D, the filters constructed in this can be evaluated efficiently. (In fact, some nonabelian groups of order N have FFT algorithms which are faster than abelian FFTs for groups of the same order! cf. <ref> [59] </ref>). The results of Karpovsky and Trachtenberg as well as Holmes show that some of these nonabelian filters can also serve as good approximants to Wiener filters for some classes of stochastic signals. <p> As argued above, the problem is that a general K-L transform will not have an efficient algorithm and thus may be useful to instead use nonabelian DFTs as suboptimal K-L transforms, taking U = F G;R , Holmes computes several examples which indicate nonabelian groups can effect good compression <ref> [59, 60] </ref>. Remark. For various classes of signals no a priori model is given and instead, the scientist is forced to experimentally estimate the statistical properties of the class of interest. Certain classes of natural images, or local regions within images may have in common certain specific characteristics [75].

Reference-contexts: The effect of this is that when the signal is finally sampled and ready for processing, only statistical statements can be made regarding the effect of removing noise. This is the domain of statistical signal processing, a subject at the heart of modern technology. See <ref> [68] </ref> for an introduction to the subject, as well as [87] for an introduction to probability and statistics from a signal processing point of view. <p> A large inner product for any given translated version indicates that there is a good chance that such a translate is the sought-after pattern, possibly additionally obscured by some noise. Statistical justification for this approach is given by the theory of maximum likelihood estimators (see e.g. <ref> [68] </ref>), the idea being to construct a likelihood function L whose value at a given g 2 SO (3) gives the likelihood of the presence or absence of the pattern translated by g, under the hypothesis of the presence or absence of the signal.

Reference-contexts: Nonuniform sample points arise in many situations, among which are a variety of techniques for the efficient, approximate reconstruction of two-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The result of an MR scan is to effectively compute the two-dimensional Fourier transform of a density function in a given anatomical slice (cf. <ref> [77] </ref> for an introduction to these ideas). If all the Fourier transforms are computed, then the density can be reconstructed exactly via the usual (abelian) two-dimensional Fourier inversion.

Reference-contexts: These representations are useful for FFT-like applications and some of these are discussed briefly in Section 4. Concluding remarks are in Section 5.

Most of the known techniques for constructing FFTs for nonabelian finite groups use irreducible representations which are adapted to a chain of subgroups. The paper <ref> [81] </ref> discusses this in great detail, but the following brief synopsis is included to indicate this application. <p> In particular, notice that in general, such a matrix is both structured and sparse. This observation (along with the use of adapted representations) provides another fundamental idea in recent work on finite group FFTs (cf. <ref> [81] </ref> for an overview). 5. Final remarks Various applications of special function theoretic generalizations of the classical FFT have been outlined here. These have built largely upon the uses of the FFT for spectral analysis of time series, as well as its applicability to digital filtering.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this section is to show how general spectral analysis can be used to analyze data on another class of designs, so-called balanced incomplete block designs. Classically, such data is analyzed by the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for linear models (cf. <ref> [91] </ref>). The following section summarizes some recent work [2] which shows that the classical analysis often can be subsumed by a spectral analysis approach. To begin, some of the notation and terminology of design theory must be recalled. Let D be any incidence structure. <p> In such examples, radiologists may be asked to rate the quality of images of a given object obtained under different image reconstruction algorithms [22]. They too may suffer from "taste fatigue" if they view too many pictures. Standard techniques (see e.g. <ref> [91] </ref>) for analyzing such data amount to computing the projections of the data onto subspaces spanned by sets of functions suggested by the combinatorial structure of the design. This is explained as follows.
