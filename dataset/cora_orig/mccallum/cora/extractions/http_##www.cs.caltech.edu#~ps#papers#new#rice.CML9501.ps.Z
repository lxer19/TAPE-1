Title: Vanishing Moments and Wavelet Approximation  
Author: Jun Tian and Raymond O. Wells, Jr. 
Note: Contents  
Date: May 1, 1995  
Abstract: We consider wavelet systems with vanishing moments equally distributed for the scaling functions and the wavelet functions (Coifman wavelet systems). It is shown that the convergence rate of the natural wavelet approximation will be exponentially fast for such wavelet systems as a function of the degree of the vanishing moments. In the biorthogonal case, a formula is given for all degrees, and it is shown that the order of regularity grows linearly with the degree of the van ishing moments.

Reference-contexts: L. Resnikoff, these synthesis scaling vectors are a smooth approximation to the scaling vector for sinc (x) = sinx x . We will discuss this further in a forthcoming paper <ref> [18] </ref>. This kind of synthesis scaling vector has a very special structure, namely, all even terms are zero, except ~a 0 = 1. And if N is odd, such a synthesis scaling vector is symmetric. <p> 2n+1 ~a 2m+1 = 2ffi 0;p l=0 0 l X (2m + 1) l ~a 2m+1 n2Z 1 33 = 2ffi 0;p l=0 0 l X (2m + 1) l ~a 2m+1 ffi l;p A m2Z = 2ffi 0;p (1) p ffi 0;p 2 Remark 1 One can prove (see <ref> [18] </ref>) that all the a k 's and ~a k 's are dyadic fractions, i.e., all of them is of the form 2p+1 2 q , for some p; q 2 Z. Such property will make the biorthogonal Coifman wavelet systems easier and faster to implement on a computer. <p> We will give a theoretical treatment of this problem in the general case in <ref> [18] </ref>.
