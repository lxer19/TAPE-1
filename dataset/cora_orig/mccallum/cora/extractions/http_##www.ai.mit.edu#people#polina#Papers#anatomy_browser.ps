Title: AnatomyBrowser: A Framework for Integration of Medical Information Keywords: visualization, anatomy atlas, model driven segmentation  
Author: P. Golland R. Kikinis C. Umans M. Halle M.E. Shenton J.A. Richolt 
Abstract: In this paper we present AnatomyBrowser, a framework for integration of images and textual information in medical applications. AnatomyBrowser allows the user to combine 3D surface models of anatomical structures, their cross-sectional slices, and the text available on the structures, while providing a rich set of cross-referencing and annotation capabilities. The 3D models of the structures are generated fully automatically from the segmented slices. The software is platform independent, yet is capable of utilizing available graphics resources. Possible applications include interactive anatomy atlases, image guided surgery and model based segmentation.

Reference-contexts: It can be readily run fl Corresponding author. Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139 y Surgical Planning Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hos pital, Boston, MA 02115 using any web browser that supports Java. In fact, the system is available on-line <ref> [1] </ref>. Although no special hardware or software is required to run AnatomyBrowser in its basic setup, it is capable of utilizing specialized graphics resources (hardware/software). <p> Visualization and full cross-referencing make Anato-myBrowser a very useful interactive teaching tool. We have generated several atlases using Anatomy-Browser. They include brain (Fig. 1), knee (Fig. 6), abdominal and inner ear data sets. They are available on-line <ref> [1] </ref>. The atlas can also be used for model driven segmentation. We can view the process of model based segmentation as a loop, in which the results of the segmentation of the previous scans are used in segmentation of the new data sets. <p> We tested AnatomyBrowser on several tumor cases in different anatomical areas: pelvis (Fig. 7), sacrum, brain, and kidney. Again, all of the cases are available on-line <ref> [1] </ref>. The tool was tested for both surgical planning and image guided surgery. During the planning stage, the surgeons used AnatomyBrowser to familiarize themselves with the 3D structure of the tumor and structures around it and to plan the directions of the cuts.

Reference-contexts: Some of the structures are annotated on the 3D display. The sagittal slice is slightly zoomed in.

Another approach is to extract anatomical knowledge from the atlas and use it to build a prior model of the input data [5].

In both cases, AnatomyBrowser can serve as an aid tool in the model based segmentation `loop': segmented images are used to accumulate knowledge of anatomy, which is used, in turn, for segmentation of the new data sets.

A digital brain atlas integrating several image modalities with the information on anatomy hierarchy was proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>. The goal of the work presented in this paper was to develop a system for visualization of segmentation results (both in 2D and 3D) and their integration with original scans and text information available on the structures. We do not restrict the application of the system to atlas generation.

Reference-contexts: The sections below discuss each interface component, the information it provides to the user and its interaction with other components of the system. 3.1 3D Model Generation We used the traditional approach of polygon (triangle) meshes for representation of 3D surface models. We use the Marching Cubes algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> to construct a triangle approximation of a surface from a set of segmented slices. We assume the segmentation to be available. Section 4 discusses connections between AnatomyBrowser and segmentation algorithms used for the medical applications.

Reference-contexts: This greatly simplifies implementation of cross-referencing between the 3D models and the cross-sectional views. 3.2 3D Model Visualization The viewer program for visualization of 3D surface models was created using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) <ref> [8] </ref>, a software package that uses available GL libraries (e.g. openGl, xGl, Mesa, etc.) to take advantage of graphics resources of a particular machine. Any other visualization library that provides dynamic rendering (such as Inventor by SGI) could be used for implementation of the viewer.

Reference-contexts: The user still has control over the surface properties of the model (color and transparency), but the properties that would require re-rendering the entire scene (for example, lighting) are kept constant. The AnatomyBrowser interface shown in Fig.1 uses the static version of the viewer. We use so-called multi-layer images <ref> [9] </ref> to save the information necessary for rendering and depth recovery for the static viewer. The idea of the multi-layer image is the following. For each pixel in the image, a view ray is constructed (Fig.2). This ray might intersect several surfaces in the scene.
