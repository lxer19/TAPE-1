Reference-contexts: the following problem equivalent to (P): 8 &gt; &gt; : 2 ffiku (; t)k p1 + b u (0; t) = u (1; t) = 0; 0 &lt; t &lt; T; (P 0 ) For simplicity, we let D T = (0; 1) fi (0; T ) and D T <ref> [ T = [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; T ). Our primary interest is in the stability properties of the steady states and in the asymptotic behavior of solutions of (P 0 ) for a given initial datum u 0 . <p> equivalent to (P): 8 &gt; &gt; : 2 ffiku (; t)k p1 + b u (0; t) = u (1; t) = 0; 0 &lt; t &lt; T; (P 0 ) For simplicity, we let D T = (0; 1) fi (0; T ) and D T [ T = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; T ). Our primary interest is in the stability properties of the steady states and in the asymptotic behavior of solutions of (P 0 ) for a given initial datum u 0 . <p> Suppose that lim t!1 and let Z 1 G (x; y)u (y; t) dy; (4:1) where G (x; y) = x (1 y); 0 x y 1; is the Green's function for d 2 dy 2 with Dirichlet boundary conditions. 15 Under the assumptions for u, F is bounded in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1) and F t (x; t) = 0 = u (x; t) 2 0 " x 0 + 2 ffiku (; t)k p1 + b j Z 1 G (x; y)u (y; t)dy " Z x ' 2 (y)dy + 2 Z 1 ' 2 (y)dy 1 <p> This limit has a constant sign that depends on whether u t 0 or u t 0. In actual fact, the limit is zero for x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; otherwise F would not have a finite limit as t ! 1. Therefore '(x) = 2 0 " x 0 + 2 ffik'k p1 + b j Z 1 G (x; y)'(y)dy; and hence ' is a solution of (S). <p> Thus there is a subinterval [x 0 ; x 1 ] contained in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that w (x; b 2 ) &lt; w (x; b 1 ) on [x 0 ; x 1 ]. Let u (x; t; b 2 ) be a solution of (P 0 ) with u 0 (x; b 2 ) = w (x; b 1 ). <p> For 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 and any " &gt; 0, or p = 2 and " &gt; 1 2 (1 + q) 1=q , the solutions of (P 0 ) are uniformly bounded on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1). Proof. We look for a supersolution v in the form v (x) = M (1oex) with M &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; oe &lt; 1 to be chosen. <p> For such oe, we can choose M so large that (4.4) holds. For the case ffi = 1, since the solution of (P 0 ) is a subsolution of (P 0 ) with ffi = 1 and 1 &lt; p &lt; 2, all solutions are bounded on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1). Next for p &gt; 2 or p = 2 with small ", we prove that with sufficiently large initial data, problem (P 0 ) with ffi = 1 does not have global solutions. To show this, we employ two different arguments. Theorem 4.4A. <p> Remark. The result for p = 2 is in contrast to that in [4], where it is shown that for any " &gt; 0, the solution of a local problem with our nonlocal term replaced by juj p1 u remains bounded on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1) when p = 2. For any large initial value, with more restriction on p and q, we also have the following theorem. Theorem 4.4B. Let p 3 and q 2. <p> First, we define the subsolution and supersolution of (G). As in Section 4, we let D T = (0; 1) fi (0; T ) and D T <ref> [ T = [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; T ). Definition. <p> First, we define the subsolution and supersolution of (G). As in Section 4, we let D T = (0; 1) fi (0; T ) and D T [ T = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; T ). Definition. <p> To this end, we define u 1 (x; t) = 0 (A3a) u n+1 (x; t) = u n (x; t): (A3b) Local Existence Theorem. Let the initial datum for problem (G) be continuous on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and satisfy 0 &lt; m &lt; 0 0 for 0 t 1, say. Then for sufficiently small T , (G) has a unique solution that satisfies kuk 2 on [0; T ]. <p> Proof that f =g is increasing After simplification and the substitution y = e z , we have f = 1 y 1oe (1 oe)(1 y) y 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; oe 2 [0; 1=2]. Note that y decreases as z increases. Hence, we have to show that f =g is decreasing in y. The numerator of its derivative, namely, f 0 g f g 0 , is We need to show that it is nonpositive. <p> The numerator of its derivative, namely, f 0 g f g 0 , is We need to show that it is nonpositive. Note that X (1) = 0; hence, it suffices to show that X 0 (y) 0 in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, or equivalently that Y (y) = oe (1 oe) 30 Again we see that Y (1) = 0; hence, it remains to show that Y 0 (y) 0 in [0,1] . But oe (1 oe)(1 y)(1 y 12oe ) as desired (recall that 0 &lt; oe &lt; 1=2). <p> We have H = t sinh (y) sinh (ty) 4y 2 sinh 2 (y) ; (B10) y 0, t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Note that H (y; 0) = H (y; 1) = 0: Hence, H y (y; 0) = H y (y; 1) = 0: (B11) Let us fix a y and see how R (t) = H y (; t) changes with t. <p> The nonnegativity of R 00 is implied by cosh (y) sinh (ty) t sinh (y) cosh (ty); or equivalently y cosh (y) sinh (y) (ty) cosh (ty) sinh (ty) ; t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: (B14) This is a consequence of the elementary fact that y cosh (y)= sinh (y) is an increasing function in y. Proof that L is decreasing in z. We follow the same line of attack. Denote S (oe) = L z (z; oe) for a fixed z.

Reference-contexts: The study of (P) was taken up with the objective of obtaining analogous results for a closely related problem. It turns out that the results we derived for (P) are more complete than those for (1.1) obtained in [4] and [11]. In <ref> [14] </ref>, Straughan et al. consider, from a computational point of view, the same initial-boundary value problem for Lu = u t + 2uu x R 1 u xx ; where Lu = &gt; &lt; u Rukuk 2 ; or u; or u + Rukuk : Here kk denotes the L 2 <p> Under appropriate scaling, this problem is included in (P) when q = 2. In particular, we are able to verify theoretically for (P) all except one of the numerical observations made in <ref> [14] </ref>. The plan of our paper is as follows. In Section 2, we state the results in the absence of convection. In Section 3, we characterize the set of stationary solutions of (P) when " &gt; 0. <p> Proof. The proof follows immediately from (3.3a,b). We have w xx = w dy w dy = 2 v (y)v yy (y): Clearly, from (3.3a,b) v yy &lt; 0. This establishes the concavity of the steady states found in <ref> [14] </ref> numeri cally. Lemma 3.2. The function h (Z) := ZH 2 0 (Z) (Z &gt; 0) is strictly increasing. The proof of this lemma is long and is therefore included in Appendix B. Lemma 3.3. <p> Increasing q has the effect of decreasing the set fb j Z 0 (b) &gt; 0g. The case ffi = 1, because of the lack of a comparison principle, is not so amenable to analysis. However, bearing in mind numerical evidence (see <ref> [14] </ref>), we may conjecture that: the positive stationary solution branch (where it exists) is stable. Next we discuss the asymptotic stabililty of the trivial stationary solution of (P 0 ). Henry [7] used a linearization method based on semigroup theory to analyze the asymptotic stability.
