Abstract: If X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X n is a sequence of non-negative independent random variables with common distribution function F (t), we write X (n) for the maximum of the sequence and S n for its sum. The ratio variate R n = X (n) /S n is a quantity arising in the analysis of process speedup and the performance of scheduling. O'Brien (1980) showed that R n fi 0 almost surely EX 1 &lt; as n fi . Since -R n is a uniformly bounded sequence it follows that EX 1 &lt; fi ER n fi 0 as n fi . Here we show that, provided either that (i) EX 1 (n fi ) . Since the asymptotics of EX (n) is often readily calculated, this provides a useful estimate for the most significant behavior of the ratio R n in expectation. We apply this result to multipro cessor scheduling policies and to the behavior of sample statistics.

Reference-contexts: Here || Y || p := (E [Y p ]) 1/p is the L p norm. (3). The characteristic maximum function c X (n) is (roughly) the solution to F hh below at (2.2.7). An example is the empirical distribution of Unix process times <ref> [Lel86] </ref>, found to be F (t) = 0.241t -1.122 . This yields c X (n) = 0.281n 0.891 and so EX (n) /n ~ 2.452n -0.109 . For the Unix workload, this is a rather slowly decaying bound, owing to the fat tail of this d.f.

Reference-contexts: It is not difficult to see that if F has finite mean, R n becomes asymptotically negligible: R n fi 0 almost surely and ER n fi 0 as well. O'Brien <ref> [OBr80] </ref> gave necessary and sufficient conditions on F for R n to converge to zero almost surely and in probability, and that characterize convergence in moment. It will be seen from applications below that is it is useful to be able to quantify the rate of approach to zero. <p> As is the case throughout, we assume that X 1 , . . . , X n are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with d.f. F. THEOREM <ref> [OBr80] </ref>. Assume X 1 , . . . , X n are i.i.d. with d.f. F.

Assume X 1 , . . . , X n are i.i.d. with d.f. F. The following are equivalent: (i) R n fi pr 0 (1.1.3) (ii) m (x) R 0 , i.e., the truncated mean varies slowly as x fi (iii) ER n fi 0 . <p> F. The following are equivalent: (i) R n fi pr 0 (1.1.3) (ii) m (x) R 0 , i.e., the truncated mean varies slowly as x fi (iii) ER n fi 0 . Proof: (i) (ii) is proved in <ref> [OBr80] </ref>. Convergence in mean always implies convergence in probability [Chu74], so (iii) fi (i). Conversely, since the sequence R n is uniformly bounded by 1 and converges in probability to zero, then it converges in mean as well [Chu74].

Reference-contexts: The function (1 - e -w )/w decreases in w from its maximum at w = 0. This integral is a classic Laplace integral <ref> [Olv74] </ref>, and asymptotic expansion for large n proceeds as follows. First, we may replace the upper limit of integration by 1, as the contribution to the integral over the range [1, ) is easily seen to be subdominant. <p> the standard series expansion to the square root to get ER n = 2 (n -1) hhhhhhh 0 b I L 3 M O n 2 2 (n -1) hhhhhhh 0 bn I L 3n M O Setting b = does not affect the approximation except in exponentially small terms <ref> [Olv74] </ref>, and so the integrals are all elementary. Evaluating them yields ER n = 2 (n -1) hhhhhhh I L 3n M O This agrees in first term with the estimate first derived in [Cof85], but provides higher order terms. ` 4.
