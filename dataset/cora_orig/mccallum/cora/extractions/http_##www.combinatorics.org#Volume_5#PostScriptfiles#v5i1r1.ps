Abstract: For every positive integer m, we construct a symmetric (v; k; )-design with parameters v = h((2h1) 2m 1) h1 , k = h(2h 1) 2m1 , and = h(h 1)(2h 1) 2m2 , where h = 3 2 d and j2h 1j is a prime power. For m 2 and d 1, these parameter values were previously undecided. The tools used in the construction are balanced generalized weighing matrices and regular Hadamard matrices of order 9 4 d .

Reference-contexts: Such matrices are known to exist [3, IV.4.22] and have been applied to constructing symmetric designs by Rajkundlia [8], Brouwer [2], Fanning [4], and the author <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. <p> In Section 2 (Lemma 2.1), we will prove the following modification of a result from <ref> [6] </ref>: Let M be a set of matrices of order v containing the incidence matrix M of a symmetric (v; k; )-design with q = k 2 k a prime power. <p> In order to apply this lemma, we need a symmetric (v; k; )-design to start with. In the paper <ref> [6] </ref>, we have shown that the designs corresponding to certain McFarland and Spence difference sets (or their complements) serve as such starters. <p> positive integers m and d, if h = 3 2 d and j2h 1j is a prime power, then there exists a symmetric (v; k; )-design with v = h 1 These parameters are new, except m = 1 (Menon designs) and d = 0 (constructed by the author in <ref> [6] </ref>). the electronic journal of combinatorics 5 (1997), #R1 3 2 Preliminaries Throughout this paper, we will denote identity, zero, and all-one matrices of suitable orders by I, O, and J, respectively. <p> The following lemma represents a slight modification of a result proven in <ref> [6] </ref>. Since it is crucial for this paper and the proof is short, we will repeat it here. Lemma 2.1 Let v &gt; k &gt; 0 be integers. <p> In the paper <ref> [6] </ref>, we have shown that (v; k; ) can be the parameters of any McFarland or Spence difference set or their complement with q = k 2 k a prime power. <p> In this paper, we will use the Spence (36; 15; 6)-difference set in = Z 3 Z 3 Z 4 and the complementary (36; 21; 12)-difference set. In the next section, we will reproduce the construction of the corresponding M and G given in <ref> [6] </ref> 3 (36; 15; 6)- and (36; 21; 12)-difference sets We start with a brief description of the Spence (36; 15; 6)-difference set in = Z 3 Z 3 Z 4 .

Reference-contexts: Conversely, replacing 0s by 1s in the incidence matrix of a symmetric (4h 2 ; 2h 2 h; h 2 h)-design yields a regular Hadamard matrix of order 4h 2 . For references, see <ref> [9] </ref>. In this paper, we will be interested in regular Hadamard matrices of order 9 4 d , where d is a positive integer.
