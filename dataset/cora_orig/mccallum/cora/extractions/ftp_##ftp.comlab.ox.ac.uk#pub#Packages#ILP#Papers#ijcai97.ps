Abstract: Can an AI program contribute to scientific discovery? An area where this gauntlet has been thrown is that of understanding the mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis. One approach is to obtain Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) relating molecular structure to cancerous activity. Vital to this are the rodent carcinogenicity tests conducted within the US National Toxicology Program by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). This has resulted in a large database of compounds classified as carcinogens or otherwise. The Predictive-Toxicology Evaluation project of the NIEHS provides the opportunity to compare carcinogenicity predictions on previously untested chemicals. This presents a formidable challenge for programs concerned with knowledge discovery. Desirable features of this problem are: (1) involvement in genuine scientific discovery; (2) availability of a large database with expert-certified classifications; (3) strong competition from methods used by chemists; and (4) participation in true blind trials, with results available by next IJ-CAI. We describe the materials and methods constituting this challenge, and provide some initial benchmarks. These show the Inductive Logic Programming tool Progol to be competitive with current state-of-the-art. The challenge described here is aimed at encouraging AI programs to avail themselves the opportunity of contributing to an enterprise with immediate scientific value.

Reference-contexts: So far, the NTP tests have resulted in a database of more than 300 compounds that have been shown to be carcinogens or otherwise. The NIEHS Predictive Toxicology Evaluation (or PTE) project ( <ref> [ Bristol et al., 1996 ] </ref> ) is closely associated with the NTP. The PTE project identifies a group of assays that are scheduled or ongoing in the NTP. These chemicals form the "test" set for researchers. <p> The 330 chemicals make this database very large and diverse, making it a great challange to learn in. The PTE-2 compounds The second round of blind trials (PTE-2) consists of 30 compounds (of which 5 are inorganic). These are fully described in <ref> [ Bristol et al., 1996 ] </ref> , where the schedule of events suggest that all bioassay results will be available by July 1998. 3.2 Other information available The NTP has recently made available a number of structural attributes (features) describing a large section of their database. <p> These descriptions are available at http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/Main Pages. The other information available is in the form of the atom and bond connectivity of the compounds (including those in PTE-1,2). This is described further in Section 5. 4 Evaluation In <ref> [ Bristol et al., 1996 ] </ref> , the goal of predicitive toxicology (PT) is summarised as ": : : the ultimate value and most important goal of PT research may lie in the development of its potential to identify, characterise, and understand the various mechanisms or modes of action that determine <p> Figure 2 shows that tentative classifications are available from the NTP for 13 chemicals. Progol's theory has correctly classified 7 of these. This should be seen in context of the performance of other theories listed in <ref> [ Bristol et al., 1996 ] </ref> which shows that most chemists and automated methods have not been able to better this count.

So far, the NTP tests have resulted in a database of more than 300 compounds that have been shown to be carcinogens or otherwise. <p> The performance of the theory is to be evaluated according to the criteria described in Section 4. 3 Materials 3.1 The NTP database A compilation of 330 chemicals is available directly from the database of the National Cancer Institute and NTP ( <ref> [ Huff and Haseman, 1991 ] </ref> , and via the Internet at http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/ . These compounds represent all the organic chemicals that have completed NTP reports at the time of writing this paper. Of the 330 compounds, 182 (55%) are classified carcinogenic, and the remaining 148 non-carcinogenic.
