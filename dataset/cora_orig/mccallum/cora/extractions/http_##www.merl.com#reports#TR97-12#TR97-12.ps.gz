Abstract: Many problems in computer-aided design and graphics involve the process of setting and adjusting input parameters to obtain desirable output values. Exploring different parameter settings can be a difficult and tedious task in most such systems. In the Design Gallery TM (DG) approach, parameter setting is made easier by dividing the task more equitably between user and computer. DG interfaces present the user with the broadest selection, automatically generated and organized, of perceptually different designs that can be produced by varying a given set of input parameters. The DG approach has been applied to several difficult parameter-setting tasks from the field of computer graphics: light selection and placement for image rendering; opacity and color transfer-function specification for volume rendering; and motion control for articulated-figure and particle-system animation. The principal technical challenges posed by the DG approach are dispersion (finding a set of input-parameter vectors that optimally disperses the resulting output values) and arrangement (arranging the resulting designs for easy browsing by the user). We show how effective arrangement can be achieved with 2D and 3D graph drawing. While navigation is easier in the 2D interface, the 3D interface has proven to be surprisingly usable, and the 3D drawings sometimes provide insights that are not so obvious in the 2D drawings.

Reference-contexts: When the input distances come from measurements in a high-dimensional Euclidean space (which is true for the applications discussed here, although it need not be the case in other DG applications), the algorithm can be viewed as an efficient technique for principal-component analysis <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Comparisons We expected the 2D Design Gallery interface to be far superior to the 3D interface: panning and zooming in 2D is much easier than navigating in 3D, and perceiving graph structure at a glance seems to be easier in 2D.

Reference-contexts: Exploring different parameter settings can be a difficult and tedious task in most such systems. Managing and organizing the exploration of input-parameter space is usually the responsibility of the user; the computer is used as a passive instrument, not unlike a brush or pencil. Design Galleries were introduced <ref> [4] </ref> as a general paradigm for designing computer graphics and animations in which the parameter-setting task is divided more equitably and more appropriately between user and computer. <p> One solution to the arrangement problem uses graph drawing. 1 If we map each generated image or animation to a graph node, and use a perceptual distance metric (see <ref> [4] </ref> for the details of several such metrics) to generate edge weights for each edge in a complete graph, a graph drawing that correlates the perceptual distances between nodes with distances in a 2D or 3D embedding should provide an intuitive visualization of the set of graphics or animations. <p> assemble a set of lights that combine to communicate a particular mood or to focus attention on certain scene elements. 2D graph drawing is used to arrange low-resolution 1 We have also investigated another solution based on uniform-depth hierarchical arrangement, which requires solving a graph-partitioning problem to form the hierarchy <ref> [4] </ref>.
