Abstract: This paper proposes a possible mode of cross-fertilization between research in machine learning and human learning the transfer of machine learning strategies into the human learning domain. The chosen area of investigation is the use of cooperation in support of individual learning. In particular, the paper proposes to develop and to experiment with cooperative learning methods using software agents, to instruct human learners in the use of those methods that prove to be successful, and finally to assess the effectiveness of these methods for humans learning in groups. A new method of cooperative learning, called coactive learning, is presented. It is argued that humans could be taught to learn coactively. The paper investigates different coactive learning schemes with software agents. The results of the experiments show situations in which machine learning agents using coactive learning can be superior to individual machine learning agents. It is suggested that human learners be trained to learn coactively using the most successful agent protocols, and compared, on the same type of learning task, to individual learners that were not subject to this type of training.

Reference-contexts: Instance-based learning (IBL) is an inductive learning model that is used for classification tasks. IBL generates concept descriptions by storing specific training instances <ref> (Aha, Kibler & Albert 1991) </ref>. This approach improves prior work on nearest neighbor classification (Cover & Hart 1967), which stores all training instances, and thereby has larger memory requirements, slow execution speed, and is sensitive to noise.

In this type of task an agent must decide in favor of one of a predetermined set of choices. This learning task is widely applicable. It can be used for categorization, for diagnosis, or to select an applicable method from a set of methods.

This approach improves prior work on nearest neighbor classification <ref> (Cover & Hart 1967) </ref>, which stores all training instances, and thereby has larger memory requirements, slow execution speed, and is sensitive to noise. IBL can be distinguished from Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), since IBL does not involve any adaptation of cases or instances.

Reference-contexts: The interaction being provided in an automated way, the human learners can each concentrate on the learning task by combining their own data and hypothesis with the support provided through the computer-supported cooperative work environment <ref> (Greif 1997) </ref>. We see coactive learning as being relevant in human problem-solving tasks where the individuals have to provide solutions without being previously trained or with little training on the situations they might face. Examples of tasks in this category are diagnosis and design.

Reference-contexts: While the interaction strategies between learners described in this paper should pose no difficulty in their application within human groups, we would like to stress that increasing sup-port in this direction is recently offered by computer-mediated interaction support <ref> (Healy et al. 1995) </ref>. Schemes such as those described in the IB1-IB1 or in the IB1-IB2 coaction can be implemented, stored and retrieved in networked environments that connect the workstations of remotely located human learners.

Reference-contexts: task and compared to individual learners that did not benefit from this type of training, or to cooperative learners that used other learning strategies. 2 Coactive Learning Coacting is used in the psychological literature to refer to an individuals performance in the presence of other individuals performing the same task <ref> (Hill 1982) </ref>. In the context of this paper we use the term coactive learning to characterize a new multi-agent learning method in which the communication between learning agents is more explicit than interpersonal cues. Figure 1 depicts the general scheme for coactive learning.

Reference-contexts: In the human domain it may be worthwhile to include in a study of coacting the motivational factors that compel an individual to provide learning assistance to another individual. Transporting such considerations into the agent domain would require agents that have the ability to reason about intentions <ref> (Rao & Georgeff 1991) </ref>, and that are able to evaluate the utility of information exchange (Wellman 1995). For the sake of clarity we will restrict our analysis to agents that simply comply to predetermined cooperation schemes.
