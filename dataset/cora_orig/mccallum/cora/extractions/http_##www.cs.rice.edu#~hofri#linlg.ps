Abstract: We consider the problem of dynamic reorganization of a linear list, where requests for the elements are generated randomly with fixed, unknown probabilities. The objective is to obtain the smallest expected cost per access. It has been shown, that when no a priori information is given on the reference probabilities, the Counter Scheme (CS) provides an optimal reorganization rule, which applies to all possible distributions. In this paper we show that for a list of n elements, arbitrary request probabilities and a &gt; 0, the expected cost under CS achieves a ratio of at most 1 + a to the optimal (minimal) expected cost within Qn lgn=a 2 reorganization steps, for a Q we can compute.

Reference-contexts: Extensive calculations show that for several access distributions, the rate of increase of the bound is clearly super-linear in n, but still slightly below the claim. The basis of the improvement is a recently derived bound on tail-probability, relation (4) below, obtained in <ref> [2] </ref>. Unlike several other reorganization rules, the CS needs extra storage, to maintain the reference counters. Indeed, it appears that using the CS for an unlimited number of references needs counters of unbounded size. <p> In the next section we use this result to derive a global, distribution free bound on the stopping point.
