Abstract: Results in the Emergence of Social Equilibria: Abstract In this work we present a framework for the simulation of the emergence of social behavior and the analysis of the mathematical properties of a set of agents engaged in interactions mediated by a protocol that regulates the interactions and the allocation of resources. The formalization allows to predict the existence of an equilibrium and the simulation confirms this for a particular but paradigmatic case. The simulation is based on an implementation of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Prior experimentation (for example, Axelrod's tournaments) showed that tit-for-tat is the most adequate solution of this models. Our framework, based on certain realistic assumption, shows instead that tit-for-tat is unstable: a population of tit-for-tatters mimics a population of irrational agents if it becomes infected by even a low percentage of them.

Reference-contexts: The classical solution provided by economic theory is to define economic agents as entities with a perfect knowledge of the economical environment, including the cognitive state of all the other agents <ref> [Arrow 94] </ref>. This model produces as a solution a state of equilibrium where the entire relevant information is contained in the prices. A state of disequilibrium is avoided, since knowledge and information are complete: there is no room for inconsistent decisions.

Reference-contexts: A state of disequilibrium is avoided, since knowledge and information are complete: there is no room for inconsistent decisions. This model has been subject of strong criticisms, since it fails to provide a realistic representation of any non-ideal economic system <ref> [Simon 82] </ref>. Disequilibrium states and non-optimal choices are common facts of social behavior, so more accurate representations require to abandon the assumption of omniscient agents. For instance, there are game-theoretic models in which, instead, uncertainty is a fundamental feature [Myerson 91].

For instance, there are game-theoretic models in which, instead, uncertainty is a fundamental feature <ref> [Myerson 91] </ref>. These economies are still composed of agents engaged in simple interactions, but with the proviso that they may be uncertain about the characteristics of the other agents, and are therefore unable to always predict their choices accurately.

Reference-contexts: Proof 1 Immediate from the definition of the Lagrangean function L i in the previous proof.2 3 Experimental Framework The simulation which this paper reports is actually an implementation of the Prisoner's Dilemma <ref> [Hofstadter 95] </ref>. This is a non-cooperative symmetric game in which two agents, a and b play either a strategy 1 or a strategy 2.

Reference-contexts: A conclusion usually drawn from the victory of tit-for-that is that in an environment in which behavior can mutate, natural selection will favor the formation of colonies of tit-for-tatters as stable and strong communities, able to reject antisocial elements <ref> [Axelrod 84] </ref>. The results presented here show that this model of interaction is itself very sensitive to perturbations and so its predictions are unreliable. The feature of the protocol that makes Axelrod's experiment an unreliable source of predictions is the matching protocol.
