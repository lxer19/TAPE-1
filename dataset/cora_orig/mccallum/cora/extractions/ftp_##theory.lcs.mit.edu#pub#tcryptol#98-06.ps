Reference-contexts: While a proof of security in the random oracle model is certainly preferable to no proof at all, a proof in the "real world" would be even better. Indeed, recent work by Canetti, Goldreich, and Halevi <ref> [3] </ref> show that there are cryptographic schemes that are secure in the random oracle model, but insecure in the real world|no matter what hash function is chosen. It is not yet clear what the implications of these results are.

Reference-contexts: Security against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack also implies non-malleability (defined by Dolev, Dwork and Naor <ref> [5] </ref>), meaning that an adver 2 sary cannot take an encryption of some plaintext and "massage" it into an encryption of a different plaintext that is related in some interesting way to the original plaintext.

Reference-contexts: of security relies only on standard intractability assumptions, namely, the hardness of the Diffie-Hellman decision problem in the underlying group, and the collision intractability of the hash function. 1 The hardness of the Diffie-Hellman decision problem is essentially equiv-alent to the semantic security of the basic El Gamal encryption scheme <ref> [6] </ref>. Thus, with the additional assumption of a collision-resistant hash function, and just a bit more computation, we get security against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack, whereas the basic El Gamal scheme is completely insecure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack.

Reference-contexts: There appears to be no other encryption scheme in the literature that enjoys both of these properties simultaneously. Chosen Ciphertext Security The notion of semantic security (defined by Goldwasser and Micali <ref> [8] </ref>) captures the notion of security of a public key cryptosystem against chosen plaintext attack. It is now generally accepted that this is a basic requirement of a good cryptosystem.

Reference-contexts: A chosen ciphertext attack is one in which the adversary has access to a "decryption oracle," allowing the adversary to decrypt ciphertexts of his choice.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper, we present and analyze a new public key cryptosystem that is provably secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (as defined by Rackoff and Simon <ref> [13] </ref>). The scheme is quite practical, requiring just a few exponentiations over a group, and the application of a hash function. <p> Typically, one distinguishes between a weak form of this attack, known as a lunch-time attack (defined by Naor and Yung [12]), and the strongest possible form, known as an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (defined by Rackoff and Simon <ref> [13] </ref>). In a lunch-time attack, the adversary queries the decryption oracle some number of times, after which, he obtains the target ciphertext that he wishes to cryptanalyze, and is not allowed to query the decryption oracle further.
