Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the last decade, many efforts have been devoted to an analysis of the epistemological adequacy, and the computational effectiveness of Description Logics (DLs). In particular, starting with <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> , the research on the computational complexity of the reasoning tasks associated with DLs has shown that in order to ensure decidabili-ty and/or efficiency of reasoning in all cases, one must renounce to some of the expressive power [ 17; 19; 20; 12; 13; 11 ] .

Reference-contexts: Much of the research on CLASSIC <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> follows this approach. * The third approach, similarly to the first one, advocates very expressive languages, but, in order to achieve efficiency, accepts incomplete reasoning procedures. There is no general consensus on what kind of incompleteness is acceptable.

Reference-contexts: Systems like OMEGA [ 1 ] , LOOM [ 18 ] and KL-ONE <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> , can be considered as following this approach. * The second approach advocates a careful design of the DLs so as to offer as much expressive power as possible while retaining the possibility of sound, complete, and efficient (often polynomial in the worst case) inference procedures.

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting that, from the PDLs' point of view, an ABox has a natural counterpart: it can be regarded as a specification of partial computations. Recently, both Schild and ourselves <ref> [ 24; 8 ] </ref> have pointed out that the correspondence between DLs and PDLs, can be extended to another logic of programs called (modal/propositional) mu-calculus [ 15 ] (see [ 26 ] for more references).

This logic has the salient property of including explicit constructs for least and greatest fixpoints of formulae, which makes it more expressive than comparable PDLs.

Reference-contexts: clear that reasoning about assertions on classes is equivalent to reasoning about dynamic logic formulae (e.g., logical implication wrt a TBox, in any of the above logics, is equivalent to satisfiability of a specified dynamic logic formula), so that the large body of research on decision procedures for PDLs (see <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> for references) can be exploited in the setting of DLs.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the presence of the fixpoint constructs enables the logic to fully express inductive and co-inductive definitions, as well as to model, in a single framework, terminological cycles interpreted according to Least Fixpoint Semantics, Greatest Fixpoint Semantics, and Descriptive Semantics (see <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> ). We have studied an 2 extension of mu-calculus that includes qualified number restrictions on atomic roles, showing that satisfiability is EXPTIME-complete for it.

Reference-contexts: The second approach is based on the work by Schild <ref> [ 23 ] </ref> , which singled out a correspondence between some DLs of the kind described above and a certain class of logics of programs: the Propositional Dynamic Logics (PDLs), which are modal logics specifically designed for reasoning about program schemes. <p> However, in order to fully exploit this correspondence, at least three problems left open in <ref> [ 23 ] </ref> need to be solved, namely, how to fit functional restrictions on both atomic roles and their inverse, number restrictions, and assertions on individuals, respectively, into the correspondence. Note that these problems refer to points (1) and (3) above.
