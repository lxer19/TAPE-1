Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The primal-dual infeasible-interior-point algorithm which we will discuss has stemmed from the primal-dual interior-point algorithm (Megiddo <ref> [16] </ref>, Kojima, Mizuno, and Yoshise [7], Monteiro and Adler [19], Tanabe [22]) for linear programs. <p> At each iterate (x k ; y k ; z k ) of a primal-dual infeasible-interior-point algorithm, we compute a Newton direction (x; y; z) towards a point on the central trajectory (the path of centers, Megiddo <ref> [16] </ref>, see also Fiacco and McCormick [3]), and then generate a new point (x k+1 ; y k+1 ; z k+1 ) such that x k+1 = x k + ff k y k+1 = y k + ff k z k+1 = z k + ff k Here ff k <p> In fact, we define the central trajectory (Megiddo <ref> [16] </ref>) as the set of solutions (x; z) &gt; 0 to the system of equations z = M x + q and X z = e for every &gt; 0, the Newton direction at a k'th iterate (x k ; z k ) &gt; 0 as the unique solution (x; z)

Reference-contexts: Since all the functions in the inequalities above are linear or quadratic, we can easily compute the value of ff k by solving them for ff. We can verify that for every i (i = 1; 2; . . . ; n) and ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, f i (ff) = x k i + ff (z k i z i ) + ff 2 x i z i = x k i ff (x k i fi 1 (x k ) T z k =n) + ff 2 x i z i = x k <p> k ) + ff 2 (x) T z = (x k i fl (x k ) T z k =n)(1 ff) + fi 1 (1 fl)((x k ) T z k =n))ff fi 1 (1 fl)(* fl =n)ff ff 2 (by (13), (15) and (17)) Similarly, for every ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, g p (ff) fi 1 * fl ff ff 2 if g p (0) = (x k ) T z k fl p kAx k bk 0; g d (ff) fi 1 * fl ff ff 2 if g d (0) = (x k ) T z k fl <p> It is convenient to introduce the following primal-dual pair of parametric linear programs with parameters p ; d 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: P ( p ; d ) Minimize c ( d ) T x subject to Ax = b ( p ); x 0: D ( p ; d ) Maximize b ( p ) T y subject to A T y + z = c ( d ); z <p> = c ( d ); z 0: Here, b () = Ax 1 + (1 )b; We obtain from (11) that Ax k b = j=1 p )(Ax 1 b); and that A T y k + z k c = j=1 j These properties were shown in the paper <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: At each iterate (x k ; y k ; z k ) of a primal-dual infeasible-interior-point algorithm, we compute a Newton direction (x; y; z) towards a point on the central trajectory (the path of centers, Megiddo [16], see also Fiacco and McCormick <ref> [3] </ref>), and then generate a new point (x k+1 ; y k+1 ; z k+1 ) such that x k+1 = x k + ff k y k+1 = y k + ff k z k+1 = z k + ff k Here ff k p 0 and ff k d <p> many people have pointed out to us that the terminology "exterior" is inappropriate because the algorithm still generates a sequence of points within the interior of the region determined by the nonnegativity constraints and an exterior point algorithm usually means an algorithm that relaxes the nonnegativity constrains (see, for example, <ref> [3] </ref>). Y. Zhang proposed to use the new name "an infeasible interior-point algorithm." But it may give an impression "an infeasible algorithm" to the readers. To avoid such an impression, we have modified it to "an infeasible-interior-point algorithm."

Reference-contexts: If we choose sufficiently small positive fl; fl p and fl d , we can expect that the large step lengths ff k p and ff k d given in (10) usually satisfy (6). Remark 2.2. Kojima, Megiddo, and Noma <ref> [5] </ref> proposed a continuation method that traces a trajectory leading to a solution of the complementarity problem. If we take a positive fl less than but close to 1 and small positive fl p , fl d , then the set N constitutes a narrow neighborhood of the central trajectory.

Reference-contexts: Lustig, Marsten and Shanno [13] showed the equivalence of the the limiting feasible direction and the Newton direction to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition for the linear program P and D. To mitigate the drawback of interior-point algorithms, Kojima, Mizuno, and Yoshise <ref> [9] </ref> recently proposed an artificial self-dual linear program with a single big M as well as a numerical method for updating the big M . <p> We also mention that the infeasible-interior-point algorithm can be interpreted as an application of an interior-point algorithm to the artificial self-dual linear program (see Section 4 of <ref> [9] </ref>). <p> the 1-norm of a vector u 2 R ` , i.e., kuk 1 = P ` (b) If (2) holds, we can derive information on the infeasibility such that the primal-dual pair of P and D has no feasible solution in a certain wide region of the primal-dual space. (See <ref> [9] </ref> for a method of getting such information in interior-point algorithms.) In Section 2 we give the details of the primal-dual infeasible-interior-point algorithm using the step length control rule, where the inequalities (1) and (2) serve as stopping criteria. In Section 3 we establish that the algorithm enjoys property (a).

Reference-contexts: It has already been studied by many researchers (Lustig [12], Lustig, Marsten, and Shanno [13], Marsten, Subrama-nian, Saltzman, Lustig, and Shanno [14], Tanabe [22, 23], Vanderbei and Carpenter <ref> [24] </ref>, etc.), and is known as practically efficient algorithms among numerous variations and extensions of the primal-dual interior-point algorithm. 1 Many numerical studies show that the algorithm solves large scale practical problems very efficiently ([12, 13, 14], etc.).
