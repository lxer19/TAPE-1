Abstract: This paper appeared in the 1994 AAAI Fall Symposium on Relevance. Abstract Given a domain of related problem classes and a set of general decision-making procedures applicable to them, this paper describes AWL, an algorithm to filter out those procedures that prove irrelevant, self - contradictory, or untrustworthy for a particular class. With an external model of expertise as its performance criterion, the algorithm uses a perceptron-like model to learn problem-class-specific weights for its decision-mak ing procedures. Learning improves both the efficiency of the decision-making process and the per formance of the system.

Reference-contexts: Although several FORR-based programs are in devel - opment, the most accomplished is Hoyle, for the domain of two-person, perfect information, finite board games <ref> (Epstein 1992) </ref>. In Hoyle, a problem class is a game, such as chess or tic-tac-toe. Each game is defined by a different instantiation of the problem frame that describes the board, the playing pieces, and the rules.

Reference-contexts: 1. The Reasoning Framework The problemsolving and learning architecture called FORR (FOrr the Right Reasons) relies upon a set of Advisors , general purpose, heuristic rationales that make decisions across a set of related problem classes <ref> (Epstein 1994) </ref>. This paper describes an algorithm that learns the rele vance of each Advisor to any particular problem class. In this context, relevance is the usefulness of a general - purpose heuristic for decision making in a specific prob - lem class.

Reference-contexts: The learned weights are a modification of Littlestones perceptron-like algo - rithm <ref> (Littlestone 1988) </ref> . The weight for Advisor i is a c ij i ' where a i = 1 b i ' = f 3 If weights were updated during the play of the contest, j would be the state.
