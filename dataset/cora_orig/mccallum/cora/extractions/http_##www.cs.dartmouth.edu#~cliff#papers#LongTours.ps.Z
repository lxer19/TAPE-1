Abstract: This paper considers weight-maximizing variants of the classical symmetric and asymmetric traveling-salesman problems. Like their weight-minimizing counterparts, these variants are MAX SNP-hard. We present the first nontrivial approximation algorithms for these problems. Our algorithm for directed graphs finds a tour whose weight is at least 38 63 0:603 times the weight of a maximum-weight tour, and our algorithm for undirected graphs finds a tour whose weight is at least 5 from each cycle of a maximum-weight cycle cover. Our algorithm for directed graphs can be used to improve several recent approximation results for the shortest-superstring problem. 1 Introduction

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The traveling-salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most famous and most fundamental problems in computer science. It has many practical applications, and it is also (presumably) quite difficult to solve, being one of the original NP-hard problems <ref> [10] </ref>. For these reasons, considerable research effort has been focused on designing good approximation algorithms for the TSP.

Reference-contexts: Even with the triangle inequality, however, both the undirected (i.e., symmetric) and directed (i.e., asymmetric) versions of the problem are MAX SNP-hard <ref> [11] </ref>, which means there are likely to be approximation bounds strictly greater than 1 that no (polynomial-time) approximation algorithm can achieve. <p> For directed graphs, the best algorithm [7] guarantees a tour whose weight is at most an O (log n) factor times optimal. We are aware of very little work on the problem of finding a longest tour. On the negative side, the reduction in <ref> [11] </ref> also implies that both the undirected and directed variants of the Max TSP are MAX SNP-hard.

Reference-contexts: Given a graph G = (V; E) and a function w : E ! R + assigning a nonnegative weight to each edge, even approximating a shortest tour is NP-hard <ref> [12] </ref>; thus, it is traditional to consider instances with edge weights satisfying the triangle inequality, which requires that for any three vertices i, j, and k, w (i; j) w (i; k) + w (k; j).
