Abstract: We introduce a new matrix class P c , which consists of those matrices M for which the solution set of the corresponding linear complementarity problem is connected for every q 2 IR n . We consider Lemke's pivotal method from the perspective of piecewise linear homotopies and normal maps and show that Lemke's method processes all matrices in P c " Q 0 . We further investigate the relationship of the class P c to other known matrix classes and show that column sufficient matrices are a subclass of P c , as are 2 fi 2 P 0 -matrices.
