Abstract: We discuss what constitutes an integrated system in AI, and why AI researchers should be interested in building and studying them. Taking integrated systems to be ones that integrate a variety of components in order to perform some task from start to finish, we believe that such systems (a) allow us to better ground our theoretical work in actual tasks, and (b) provide an opportunity for much-needed evaluation based on task performance. We describe one particular integrated system we have developed that supports spoken-language dialogue to collaboratively solve planning problems. We discuss how the integrated system provides key advantages for helping both our work in natural language dialogue processing and in interactive planning and problem solving, and consider the opportunities such an approach affords for the future.

Reference-contexts: Space obviously precludes discussing all these components here. The robust speech recognition work is described in (Ringger & Allen 1996b; 1996a). Descriptions of the approach to robust language understanding can be found in <ref> (Allen et al. 1996) </ref>. The approach to planning, which is interesting for its emphasis on plan modification and its use of an expressive, temporal world model, is described in (Fergu-son & Allen 1998).

Reference-contexts: Supported by these two trends, it is now possible to build AI systems that actually perform tasks that people find difficult (and that require intelligence, however exactly you define it) in reasonable amounts of time. A good example is Deep Blue <ref> (Hamilton & Garber 1997) </ref>, which, despite some controversy, certainly counts as a highly successful, working AI system that leverages both of the trends described above. But on a smaller scale, researchers are starting to report on Copyright c fl1998, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Reference-contexts: Other systems provide a richer back end task but limit the interface. The Circuit Fix-it Shop (Smith, Hipp, & Biermann 1995), for instance, handles a complex task of diagnosing and repairing circuits, but the user must use one of a fixed set of sentences. The COLLAGEN system <ref> (Rich & Sidner 1997) </ref> involves an architecture with some strong similarities to our approach, but the interface is quite constraining and cumbersome for a person to use as it does not support natural language, and only supports plan modification by chronological backtracking.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, such systems do fit the criteria we laid out for an integrated system to the extent that they truly handle a task that a person would have in obtaining travel information. Other systems provide a richer back end task but limit the interface.

Reference-contexts: In fact, one of the earliest integrated systems is still one of richest to date. This is the Basic Agent <ref> (Vere & Bickmore 1990) </ref>, in which a person could interact in natural language with a submarine robot in a simulated world. This system lacked a compelling task to be accomplished, however, and the interactions were more of the flavor of demonstrating the capabilities of the system.
