Reference-contexts: One can easily reproduce the correspondence from trees to mappings reversing the procedure described above. We believe that the one-to-one correspondence stated above is due to Joyal. A complete description of this correspondence can be found for example in Bender and Williamson <ref> [1] </ref>. This defines a natural measure preserving mapping from the space of random mappings to the space o random trees ( just "forgets" the random choice of pair of marked vertices).

Reference-contexts: SM n (k) is a well studied model of random graph. Frieze [4] showed that SM n (2) almost surely has a perfect matching (see also Shamir and Upfal [11] who showed that SM n (6) almost surely has a perfect matching). Cooper and Frieze <ref> [2] </ref> have shown that SM n (4) almost surely has a Hamilton cycle but the problem of whether or not SM n (3) almost surely has a Hamilton cycle is one of the most important open questions in the theory of Random graphs.

Then P is stable and jP j jP 1 j s. <p> Either jKj &lt; jP j and K is a bad set of SM n (2) or jKj jP j and K; P is the required matched pair. 2 Both possibilities in Lemma 10 are shown almost surely not to happen in <ref> [4] </ref>, completing the proof of Theorem 2.

We can argue (see Lemma 2 of <ref> [5] </ref>) that M 1 and M 2 are an independent pair of matchings, chosen uniformly from the set of all possible perfect matchings.

Furthermore, (see Lemma 3 of [5]) M 1 [ M 2 is almost surely the union of at most 3 log n vertex disjoint cycles some cycles may possibly just be double edges. We show next that ST n (4) almost surely has good expansion properties. <p> Proof It follows from (3) that Prob (A 4 ) 10 3 n X k n ! n n2 k=1 4n = o (1): The idea now is to use the extension-rotation procedure (as described in <ref> [5] </ref>). The main idea that we get from [5] is to reserve the edges of T 5 for closing paths. <p> Proof It follows from (3) that Prob (A 4 ) 10 3 n X k n ! n n2 k=1 4n = o (1): The idea now is to use the extension-rotation procedure (as described in <ref> [5] </ref>).
