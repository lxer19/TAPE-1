Title: Visual Communication: Past, Present, and Future  
Author: By Ken Ling-Pei Kung 
Abstract: The advent of digital technologies brings a whole new dimension to human-to-human communication. From postal delivery system to telegraph, from telegraph to telephone, from telephone to television, technologies change the way we communicate with each other. Whether one-to-one or one-to-many, the information medium has changed from text to voice, from voice to images. The demand in bandwidth grows with the enrichment of information content. Issues in technology, policy and economics make visual communication nowhere near the ubiquitousness voice communication - telephone. Are we anywhere near that goal? What are the key technological, political and economical issues that we have to overcome to make that happen? This project examines past attempts of picturephone and videotex services, and try to shed some light into a future visual communication system.

Reference-contexts: Yet, two-way visual communication is not as omnipresent as voice communication by telephone, or as text communication by postal service today. Picturephone failed to create a niche market - video teleconferencing for business travelers, its inventors had hoped for. It cost AT&T over 500 million dollars <ref> [1] </ref>. Videotex failed to create a mass market its service providers thought it would 6 . It was a market failure in many countries, particularly in the U.S.

Reference-contexts: Videophone History As early as 1927, Bell Labs conducted an experimental faceto-face telephone conversation between Herbert Hoover (then Secretary of Commerce) in Washington DC. and AT&T President Walter Gifford in New York City using a television signal <ref> [2] </ref>. Mr. Gifford foresaw the use of television as an adjunct to telephone calls for faceto-face telecommunication in the future [3]. A series of trials and experiments led to the development of Mod II system, which saw its commercial deployment through local exchange service in Pittsburgh in 1970. <p> Some researchers had predicted that teleconferencing could take the place of from 20 to 85 percent of all meetings involving travel. Contrary to this prediction, teleconferencing services met with low acceptance. A Michael Noll hypothesized that users behavior, not technology or cost, ultimately determined the usage <ref> [2] </ref>. Users need to have the right kind of meetings, usually recurring, on-premises committee meeting intended mostly for coordination and information-exchange proposes, to justify its use. The room video conferencing paradigm of the time and high cost of connection time demanded full preparedness of equipment, personnel, agenda, and conference materials.

Most of them would make use of the video feature only for calls to their close friends or family members unless faceto-face conversation over the phone becomes a social etiquette. <p> Consumers' adaptation to a new technology usually starts with a subset of applications the technology can offer.

Reference-contexts: Marketplace Residential Although the picturephone initially targeted business customers, it was intended to evolve into a switched telecommunication service for universal use as an ultimate substitute for voice-only telephone service <ref> [5] </ref>. Market response to picturephone service was very disappointing to picturephone enthusiasts. Lack of applications was cited by most trial users. Indeed, residential use of strict faceto-face communication had limited appeal. Consumers' adaptation to a new technology usually starts with a subset of applications the technology can offer. <p> Julius P. Molnar, an executive vice president of Bell Labs, considered the major impact of the telephone and jet aircraft on communications and predicted that before the turn of the century Picturephone will displace todays means of communication; similar to what telephone did to postal service <ref> [5] </ref>. Some researchers had predicted that teleconferencing could take the place of from 20 to 85 percent of all meetings involving travel. Contrary to this prediction, teleconferencing services met with low acceptance. A Michael Noll hypothesized that users behavior, not technology or cost, ultimately determined the usage [2].

Reference-contexts: It too could not attract enough customers and shut down its operation in 1986. In other countries, videotex was not a profitable business either. Prestel did not make money until its sixth year. More detail on the pricing and economics of other systems can be found in Maynes book <ref> [7] </ref>. Marketplace Contrary to picturephone, videotex was conceived for the residential marketplace. Videotex system operators had hoped for an economic scale of a mass market to drive down the cost of CPE and their cost of operation.

Reference-contexts: By 1979, the service was expanded to reach companies outside the financial industry and PC owners using dialup phone access. DJNR charged $54 per hour prime time to $12 per hour in non-prime time, plus onetime membership fees and monthly charges <ref> [8] </ref>. Despitethe pricing was beyond the reach of general market, both did well in the marketplace. Standards Videotex development was hampered by competing standards that left manufacturers wary of producing hardware that might soon become obsolete.

Reference-contexts: The cost of memory and IC chips has gone down dramatically. Image compression techniques have improved to a point that a 30:1 compression ratio for video with good quality is commonplace. And an algorithm has been adopted by CCITT as an international standard <ref> [9] </ref>. Digital modulation-demodulation techniques with error-correcting codes can pack more bits into the same bandwidth. Packet switching technique eliminates the need of a continuous connection and allows flexible routing of data and efficient use of physical wires.
