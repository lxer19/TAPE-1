Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of two papers dealing with methods for recursively calculating codeword error and erasure probabilities for Reed-Solomon (RS) code-words. As with the previous paper [1], a single RS codeword is transmitted in a channel where each transmitted symbol experiences independent identically distributed (IID) noise or a channel where each symbol experiences independent differently distributed (IDD) noise. Each received symbol is decoded using mechanism where a symbol or an erasure is produced, and the entire codeword is decoded using a bounded-distance (BD) decoder. Specifically, this paper deals with an errors and erasures (EE) decoder, while the previous paper addressed errors only (EO) decoding. It is common practice to assume the probability of incorrect codeword decoding is negligible and assume the decoder either correctly decodes the received codeword or fails the decoding process. However, we develop an efficient, recursive, mechanism for generating the exact probabilities (correct decode, incorrect decode, and decoder failure) in the IID case and bounds on the probability of incorrect decode for the IDD case.

Reference-contexts: The probability of error to all weight k codewords can be found by summing P ID;k = A k 2 c j=0 i=0 i;jjk g; (4) where A k is the weight enumerator for an MDS code <ref> [2] </ref>. The overall probability of error is the sum over the possible weights of code words, P ID = k=d min 3.3 Probability of Decoding Failure Once the probability of correct and incorrect decoding is known, the remainder of the probability space is occupied by the probability of decoder failure. <p> Unfortunately, this vector is dependent upon the position of the zeros in the weight k codeword under consideration. In fact, there are N ! combinations of zero positions for a weight k codeword <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus, the number of cases to consider grows exponentially. For a realistic code, this complexity growth is unacceptable. <p> fi I fi6=0g ]P l [P fB i;j1jk g fi I fj6=0g ]P l Next, the probability contribution of the i'th zero pat tern is found by summing, P id;k = A i 2 c j=0 i=0 N;i where A i is the number of codewords with zero pattern i <ref> [2] </ref>. Various methods can be employed at this stage to determine how many likely zero patterns to select, L.

Reference-contexts: BD decoders fail to decode to a codeword when the received code word is not in the decoding sphere of any codeword <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, the probability of decoding failure is as follows: P DF = 1 P CD P ID (6) 4 Case II: Symbols Experience IDD Interference While Section 3 assumed each symbol in the transmitted codeword experienced statistically the same interference, this section does not. <p> Probability of in-correct decode when each symbol experiences IDD interference, P id . 4 6. Probability of decode failure when each symbol ex- periences IDD interference, P df . The major result of this work is the reduction in calculation complexity. Standard methods, such as those found in <ref> [3] </ref>, achieve their result by brute force searching. This method, while accurate, must consider all possibilities of received vectors within the decoding sphere around all codewords.
