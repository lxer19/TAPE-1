Abstract: Vortices in superconductors are a well-defined system of elastic lines or points interacting by electromagnetic and hydrodynamic forces, which can be driven through a field of pinning sites by an applied current. The dynamic response of the vortices controls most transport properties of superconductors and displays remarkable variety, including nonlinear effects, steady-state and avalanche dynamics, and thresholds for the onset of motion. A basic understanding of these dynamics is of fundamental interest and is an essential step in controlling vortex motion in technical applications. Vortex motion may be classified generally as elastic or plastic. In elastic motion, each vortex keeps the same neighbors, while in plastic motion the neighbors change. Plastic vortex flow has been identified in molecular dynamics simulations [1] and in pioneering transport experiments on NbSe 2 [2]. Plastic-to-elastic dynamic transitions have been predicted analytically [3] and explored in neutron scattering experiments [4,5] and transport measurements [6,7]. In this paper, we use large-scale simulations of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations to investigate the internal structure of elastic and plastic motion, following the individual motions of hundreds of vortices in the presence of a controlled driving force and a planar pinning defect. We find two distinct plastic phases and an elastic phase, each with different internal symmetry. We identify and compare the characteristic features of each dynamic phase and the physical conditions favoring each. sample had two parallel free surfaces defined by the boundary condition J s n = 0 (J s is the supercurrent density). A transport current was induced by a field differential between the free surfaces. Periodic boundary conditions were applied along the current direction to avoid edge effects. The sample measured 32 (between the free surfaces) by 48 (in the current direction), where is the magnetic penetration depth. The computational grid consisted of 256 fi 384 points, which gave two grid points per coherence length when the Ginzburg-Landau parameter = 4 ( = =). The absence of thermal fluctuations restricts our results to the vortex solid. Correlated disorder was introduced within a slab of thickness 2 oriented parallel to the field direction and 45 ffi to the free surfaces, a geometry common for twin boundaries in YBCO. The disorder was modeled by a reduction of the condensation energy to a mean value of 56% of the bulk value, accompanied by Gaussian spatial fluctuations with a standard deviation of 25% of the bulk value. The fluctuations in condensation energy provided resistance to vortex motion within the twin boundary, as observed experimentally [11]. There was no disorder in the bulk of the sample outside the slab. Simulations were run for three transport currents representing approximately 2% (weak current ), 4% (intermediate current ), and 8% (strong current ) of the depair-ing current. The calculated quantities and A on the computational grid at each time step provided a record of the evolution of the system. Each simulation required approximately 100 hours on 16 processors of the IBM Scalable POWERparallel (SP) computational system at Argonne National Laboratory. We report only the behavior in the steady-state portion of the time window, which was characterized by the requirement that the number of vortices in the sample vary by less than 1%.
