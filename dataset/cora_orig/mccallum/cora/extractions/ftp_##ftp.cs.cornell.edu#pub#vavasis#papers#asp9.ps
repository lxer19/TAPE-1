Title: An aspect ratio bound for triangulating a d-grid cut by a hyperplane  
Author: Scott A. Mitchell Stephen A. Vavasis 
Date: August 14, 1995  
Abstract: We consider the problem of triangulating a d-dimensional uniform grid of d-cubes that is cut by a k-dimensional affine subspace. The goal is to obtain a triangulation with bounded aspect ratio. To achieve this goal, we allow some of the box faces near the affine subspace to be displaced. This problem has applications to finite element mesh generation. For general d and k, the bound on aspect ratio that we attain is double-exponential in d. For the important special case of d = 3, the aspect ratio bound is small enough that the technique is useful in practice.

Suppose F meets N (B). <p> For instance, in the above figure we see that F has a close point for vertex (0; 0), a close point for vertex (1; 0) which is also the close point for edge <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi f0g (assuming a certain priority rule), and finally a close point for vertex (0; 1) which is the close point for the whole square.
