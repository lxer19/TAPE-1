Title: A New Probabilistic Model of Text Classification and Retrieval  
Date: January 29, 1996  
Abstract: This paper introduces the multinomial model of text classification and retrieval. One important feature of the model is that the tf statistic, which usually appears in probabilistic IR models as a heuristic, is an integral part of the model. Another is that the variable length of documents is accounted for, without either making a uniform length assumption or using length normalization. The multinomial model employs independence assumptions which are similar to assumptions made in previous probabilistic models, particularly the binary independence model and the 2-Poisson model. The use of simulation to study the model is described. Performance of the model is evaluated on the TREC-3 routing task. Results are compared with the binary independence model and with the simulation studies.

Reference-contexts: The resulting sequence is equivalent to the output of a discrete memoryless source. The probability that any particular term in the output is t i is its Poisson rate, and each token is independent of its predecessors. The present theory is thus related to the 2-Poisson model <ref> [1] </ref>, a model of term distribution in which the tf statistic plays an important role. For any class of documents C, we posit a source S, which generates that class. <p> As noted in the introduction, addressing the term-dependence problem will be a high priority in future versions of the theory. 5 Related Work The 2-Poisson model <ref> [1] </ref> introduced the idea of multiple Poisson distributions. That work was primarily concerned with the problem of automatic indexing, that is, identifying a set of terms by which a document could be represented.

Reference-contexts: We make the assumptions for mathematical convenience; if they become an obstacle, we try to relax them (although this has not proved easy for the binary independence model; see [9]). Cooper <ref> [2] </ref> describes the assumption of the binary independence model as "linked dependence", which he argues is considerably weaker than a true independence assumption. That argument does not apply to the multinomial model. For each of the two discrete memoryless sources, the symbols generated are assumed to be strictly independent.

Reference-contexts: These questions can be explored through simulation. Simulations of both the multinomial model and the binary independence model were implemented. We simulated performance on the TREC-3 routing task <ref> [3] </ref>, using disk 1 for training data. We computed term statistics from the relevant and non-relevant document sets for each topic. All terms occurring in the relevant set were considered. All documents not in the relevant set were considered non-relevant.

Reference-contexts: The TPI model [6] is a combination of the binary independence model and the 2-Poisson model. A previous approach which extended the binary independence model to cover multiple term occurrences is described in [11] and [12]. Another approach in which text is generated by a stochastic process is <ref> [4] </ref>, which employs a hidden Markov model. 6 Conclusions and future work The multinomial model gives a simple account of how tf can come into probabilistic models, through modeling the generation of text by a stochastic process. It also takes document length into account in a new and well-justified way.

Reference-contexts: The multinomial model is thus a first-order model, which makes the simplest possible assumptions. In this respect, it is comparable to the binary indepen dence model <ref> [5] </ref>. 1 2 The Multinomial Model 2.1 Text Generation Formally, we begin with a finite lexicon L, each element of which is a term. Following the common practice in IR, we consider words to be the basic units of text, ignoring punctuation, etc.

Reference-contexts: Documents were assumed to be of uniform length, and the theory was developed using Poisson means rather than Poisson rates, where the mean is the rate times document length.

Reference-contexts: This consideration is related to the use in many IR systems of a function of tf which grows more slowly than tf itself. Some of these are: (0:5 + 0:5 fi tf =maxtf ) [8] log (tf + 1) tf =(tf + const) <ref> [7] </ref> Ultimately, we would like any modification to tf to come from changes in the model; and if the model changes, the entire discriminant function is likely to be affected.
