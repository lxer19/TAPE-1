Title: Distributed Sensor Interpretation: Modeling Agent Interpretations in DRESUN  
Author: Norman Carver, Victor Lesser, and Qiegang Long (carver, lesser, or qlong 
Abstract: CMPSCI Technical Report 93-75 September 1993 Abstract The DRESUN testbed for research on distributed situation assessment (DSA) was developed to explore the implications of having agents with more sophisticated evidential representations and control capabilities than the agents that were used in our earlier research with the Distributed Vehicle Monitoring Testbed (DVMT). In DRESUN, communication among the agents is driven by the goal of determining the global consistency of local agent solutions, with unresolved global consistency questions viewed as sources of uncertainty about the correctness of local agent solutions. This paper reports on issues that have arisen in modeling the beliefs of other agents when dealing with inter-agent communication of incomplete and conflicting evidence, and evidence at multiple levels of abstraction. Experimentation showed that extensions to the DRESUN model of external evidence were necessary to better represent the uncertainties that occur when DRESUN agents exchange such information. These are important issues since DSA agents typically must exchange much information in order to meet their goals. Furthermore, because DSA agents require evidential representations, this work is different from DAI work that has used justification-based representations of belief and has focused on methods for automatically maintaining (some level of) global consistency. Initial experimentation has been done with a variety of simulated distributed aircraft monitoring scenarios involving local solutions that are globally inconsistent and local solution uncertainty that can be resolved only through agent interactions. These experiments suggest that DRESUN agents have the flexibility to support the complex communication protocols and highly directed information exchanges that we believe are necessary to resolve global inconsistencies in DSA applications. fl This paper is a revised and extended version of the paper, "Resolving Global Inconsistency in Distributed Sensor Interpretation: Modeling Agent Interpretations in DRESUN" that appeared in the Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Distributed Artificial Intelligence, May, 1993.

Reference-contexts: This architecture was selected because our earlier research suggested that a sophisticated agent architecture is necessary to support the complex interaction protocols that are required in real-world DSA systems <ref> [Lesser 1991] </ref>. DRESUN agents are "sophisticated" because they are self-aware and can implement highly context-specific problem-solving strategies. One of the key ideas in RESUN is the use of symbolic source of uncertainty statements (SOUs) in the evidence for the interpretation hypotheses. <p> complete lack of knowledge about the relations|e.g., even if it were to process all of its data, it could not resolve the consistent-global-extension SOU as it could for a partial-support SOU. 8 The connection between resolution of inconsistency in cooperative distributed problem solving and work on negotiation was noted in <ref> [Lesser 1991] </ref>. 12 Here, local agent interpretations interact because there is data in the overlapping region. We assume that agent B is the first to form an interpretation of this data as part of a track based on its local data.

This makes distributed interpretation different from the DCSPs considered in [Yokoo, Durfee, Ishida, & Kuwabara 1992], and it means that the algorithms presented there are insufficient for distributed interpretation.
