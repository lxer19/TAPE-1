Title: Relative Class Number of Imaginary Abelian Fields of Prime Conductor below 10000  
Author: M.A. Shokrollahi 
Date: June 15, 1998  
Abstract: In this paper we compute the relative class number of all imaginary Abelian fields of prime conductor below 10000. Our approach is based on a novel multiple evaluation technique, and, assuming the ERH, it has a running time of O(p 2 log 2 (p) log log(p)), where p is the conductor of the field.

Reference-contexts: According to the author, his algorithm has a running time of O (p 2 log (p)). However, Jha's running time analysis contains an error. We will discuss this later in Section 4. Following a completely different line of thought, Louboutin <ref> [19] </ref> describes an elegant method for computing the relative class numbers of imaginary Abelian fields and uses it to compute relative class numbers of Abelian fields of small degree and large conductor. His method is based on computing good approximations of generalized Bernoulli numbers and then using class number formulas. <p> The only lower bound we know for this task is (p log (p)), which is the size of h . Our algorithm, however, has running time O (p 2+* ). Conjecturally, Louboutin's <ref> [19] </ref> algorithm has a running time of O (p 1:5+* ), so the discrepancy between the lower and the upper bound is a factor of p p. Unfortunately we do not know of any means to close this gap at the present time.

Reference-contexts: Then, for each h encountered, we compute its transform, multiply it with the transform of v, and transform the product back. This reduces the number of Fourier transforms per polynomial multiplication from three to two. Another improvement can be gained using an idea of D. Reischert <ref> [26] </ref>. If p is not a Fermat prime, then the largest prime factor q t of p 1 is odd, hence we have to perform a negacyclic convolution of h (x) and v (x).

Reference-contexts: Translated into integer multiplication, this means that we are performing multiplication modulo 2 m + 1 for some m. If m is such that 32m = 2 k l &lt; (2k 1)2 2k , then one can perform the Schonhage-Strassen multiplication algorithm to compute this integer product. (See <ref> [29, p. 32] </ref>.) The advantage over the method which multiplies h and v as integers and reduces the product mod x q t + 1 is that the length of the numbers to be multiplied is smaller. (We do not need zero-padding in this version.) However, since 32m might contain a <p> These clean and efficient implementations made TP the natural choice to implement our algorithm in. For more information on this software and how to obtain it via ftp, the reader is referred to the TP-book <ref> [29] </ref>. 4. Computing the Relative Class Number In this section, we develop an algorithm for computing h e (p) for all odd divisors e of p 1. Our algorithm is very similar to the one suggested by Jha [13].

Reference-contexts: &lt; 2 m for all i, we obtain c i = P l+j=i h l v j , hence h (x)v (x) = P 2d2 The running time of this algorithm is clearly dominated by the time needed to multiply two integers of bit-length dm, which, using the Schonhage-Strassen algorithm <ref> [30] </ref>, is O (dm log (dm) log log (dm)). 3.2. Second Version of the Algorithm. A major improvement can be gained by employing an idea related to the multiple evaluation algorithm of Borodin and Moenck [3] and [5, Chapter 3].

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm is based on the multiple evaluation algorithm of Borodin and Moenck [3, 5]. However, we are able to use prime divisors of (p 1) to considerably accelerate the computations. The very same method has been successfully used to compute all irregular primes below 8 million <ref> [32, 31, 4] </ref>. The multiple evaluation algorithm will be applied to several primes q. Chinese remaindering techniques will then ultimately yield the desired class numbers. We close the paper by a description of our implementations, and provide several tables. 2.

Reference-contexts: Results 5.1. Parity of the Class Number. The parity of the relative class number h (p) of the field Q ( p ) has attracted a lot of attention ever since Kummer's introduction of cyclotomic class numbers. We refer to [10] and <ref> [33] </ref> and the references therein for a discussion of the history of this problem. It has been conjectured [9] that h (p) is odd whenever p and (p 1)=2 are both primes. The conjecture seems to go back to Taussky's work [34]. <p> The conjecture seems to go back to Taussky's work [34]. This conjecture has been verified by Estes [10] in the case that 2 is inert in the maximal real subfield of Q ( p ). Stevenhagen <ref> [33] </ref> gives a different proof of this result and provides a heuristic argument in favour of the conjecture and strengthens these arguments by extensive calculations.

Reference-contexts: Motivated by his results on divisibility properties of class numbers of cyclotomic fields, Kummer was the first to carry out computations of relative class numbers of cyclotomic fields of prime conductor for primes below 163. It took more than 100 years to extend these computations: Schrutka von Rechtenstamm <ref> [35] </ref> computed relative class numbers of cyclotomic fields only, for all conductors below 256: In 1970, Newman [22] who was apparently unaware of Schrutka's tables, recomputed those values for primes below 200: Newman's method was based on a determinantal description of the relative class number due to Carlitz and Olson [6].

Reference-contexts: The relative class number of K, denoted by h (K) is the quotient h=h + , where h and h + are the class number of K and K + , respectively. It is well known <ref> [36, Theorem 4.17, Corollary 4.13] </ref> that h (K) = Qw 2 where runs over all odd characters of the Galois group of K=Q, w is the number of roots of unity in K, and Q = [E: W E + ].

Reference-contexts: To the best of our knowledge, the only published tables of relative class numbers of all imaginary Abelian fields of prime conductor are those of Hasse [12] for primes below 100, in part those of Schrutka of Rechtenstamm, and those of Yoshino and Hirabayashi <ref> [37] </ref> who extend Hasse's results to all primes below 200. Like Lehmer-Masley or Fung et al.'s approach, we also obtain a partial factorization of the class number in a very natural way.
