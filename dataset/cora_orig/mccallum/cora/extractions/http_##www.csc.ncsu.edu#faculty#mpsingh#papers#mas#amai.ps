Reference-contexts: It too is primarily concerned with the linguistic or discourse-related aspects of this problem, e.g., for identifying the illocutionary force of indirect speech acts <ref> [1] </ref>, or for defining their effects on the mutual beliefs of agents [7]. Speech acts are defined in terms of the effects of the cognitive state of the hearer that are intended by the speaker. They are seen as parts of plans that the participants find and execute [2].

Reference-contexts: Natural Language Understanding and Generation. This application is perhaps the easiest to identify, since ultimately all of natural language involves speech acts. In particular, it helps to consider speech acts as first-rate actions that discourse participants plan, and then perform <ref> [2] </ref>. A formal semantics would provide clear criteria for success and failure that can be used in better integrating the natural components of an intelligent system with other parts of it. <p> Speech acts are defined in terms of the effects of the cognitive state of the hearer that are intended by the speaker. They are seen as parts of plans that the participants find and execute <ref> [2] </ref>. This idea helps explain the true illocutionary force of a speech act and also sheds some light on the phenomena of presuppositions and implicature.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the most significant developments in the study of language was the formulation of speech act theory by Austin, Grice, Searle, and others. Austin's main contribution was in pointing out that the major role of language, communication, is a kind of action par excellence <ref> [3] </ref>. This idea has inspired much work in the Philosophy of Language, Linguistics, and Artificial Intelligence. Unfortunately, research in each of these three areas has been concentrated on what are, from the point of view of semantics, somewhat peripheral matters.

Reference-contexts: This distinguishes the taxonomy of this paper from other classifications of speech acts. Since syntactically, permissives, prohibitives, and directives are all imperatives, they are usually classified together, e.g., by Bach & Harnish <ref> [4, pp. 39-54] </ref> and Searle & Vanderveken [21, ch. 9]. This is surprising in the case of Searle & Vanderveken, since their focus is pragmatic, rather than syntactic.

Reference-contexts: Several applications of this theory were discussed in x1. The particular formalization that one chooses depends on the application at hand. For example, the closure of intentions, as of knowledge, under logical consequence is problematic for humans [26], but is acceptable for processes in distributed computing <ref> [5] </ref>. Secondly, I do not wish to debate the relative merits of different theories here: my claim is that no matter how one understands the primitives involved, the satisfaction of a speech act requires that certain conditions hold among them.

These inferences involve the updating of the beliefs, intentions, and mutual beliefs of the speaker and the hearer|for this reason, Cohen & Levesque's approach is largely of pragmatic interest.

Reference-contexts: A subscenario is a triple, hS; t; t 0 i, which denotes a section of scenario S from time t to t 0 . 4.1 The Formal Language The formal language of this paper, L, is based on CTL* (a propositional branching time logic <ref> [9] </ref>) augmented with a predicate for intention, `intends' and two predicates for knowhow, `K how ' and `K prev .' Each of these applies to an agent and a formula. The predicate for communication, `comm,' is as defined above, as is the operator WSAT. <p> The satisfaction conditions for the temporal operators are adapted from those in <ref> [9] </ref>. Formally, we have the following definitions. 1. M j= t iff hti 2 [[ ]] 3. M j= t :p iff M 6j= t p 5. M j= t Pp iff (9t 0 : t 0 &lt; t ^ M j= t 0 p) 7.

Reference-contexts: The appropriate effect would include the instantiation of various mutual beliefs, perhaps with further restrictions enforced on them <ref> [10, 20] </ref>. 2.3 Artificial Intelligence Work in Computational Linguistics on speech acts has borrowed heavily from the tradition in Pragmatics.

Reference-contexts: An interrogative is then a directive to assert the correct answer to the given question, i.e., the set of substitutions for which the above expression evaluates to true. This corresponds to the semantics of questions, e.g., as proposed by Groenendijk & Stokhof <ref> [11] </ref>. Let R be a set of tuples. Let `answer-to ((~ap), R)' hold iff (8 ~ b : ~ b 2 R$ (~ap)[ ~ b]); i.e., R is the answer to (~ap).

Reference-contexts: In the context of imperatives, Hamblin distinguishes between what he calls extensional and whole-hearted satisfaction <ref> [12, pp. 153-157] </ref>. Briefly, the former notion admits accidental or contingent success, while the latter does not. Here I consider only the latter, though I extend it to other important kinds of speech acts. Also, my aim is to obtain a semantics of speech acts.

Reference-contexts: Also, when the above complex speech act is considered, we can see that the act of issuing a promise involves at least intending to issue it, and knowing how to do so. Interrogatives are semantically quite like directives; e.g., see Searle & Vanderveken [21, p. 199] and Harrah <ref> [13, p. 740, 747] </ref>. However, they need special treatment to allow for answers to be defined and received. <p> Thus it is satisfied when a true answer to it is given, i.e., the assertive containing the answer is itself satisfied. This derives from an intuition about treating interrogatives as imperatives of the form `Tell me Truly' <ref> [13, pp. 747-748] </ref>. We need to introduce `interrogative' as a new force in F . This is a subcategory of directives. Questions can be thought of as lambda expressions of the form (~ap).

Reference-contexts: A problem not addressed here concerns the effects a speech act has on the hearer. These depend on issues such as the social relationship of the agents or on matters of performance| these are not easy to describe, and are connected to processes of deliberation and belief revision <ref> [17] </ref>, rather than to the semantics of speech acts per se. Similarly, how an agent 6 ought to respond to a speech act is a matter of pragmatics. <p> Perrault has argued that, despite Cohen & Levesque's attempts, how the participants' cognitive states ought to be updated cannot be monotonically specified <ref> [17] </ref>. He proposes that a default mechanism, in his paper Reiter's default logic, be used to characterize the effects of speech acts and, hence, their pragmatic content. In more recent work, Vanderveken has independently addressed the problems of the "success and satisfaction" of speech acts [27, 28].

Reference-contexts: For example, the above indicative and imperative may be recast as "I tell you that the door is shut" and "I order you to shut the door," respectively. This sort of syntactic regularity has driven much work in generative grammar, e.g., that of J. R. Ross <ref> [18] </ref>. The performative form of a sentence is taken to be the deep structure from which the appropriate surface structure is derived.
Reference: [19] <author> John R. Searle. </author> <title> Speech Acts. </title> <publisher> Cambridge University Press, </publisher> <address> Cambridge, UK, </address> <year> 1969. </year>
Reference-contexts: The sentence "I request you to open the door" is thus true, if I succeed in so requesting you, i.e., if I can in an appropriate manner convince you of my intention to communicate that request (e.g., see <ref> [19, p. 43] </ref>). What I requested, and whether that request was satisfied, are two factors that are simply left out of the picture. These factors are central to the picture of this paper. A problem not addressed here concerns the effects a speech act has on the hearer. <p> Classical semantics only tells us when an assertive is objectively satisfied|it makes no claims about when a given assertive should actually be uttered or believed. 3.1 Illocutionary Force and Propositional Content Traditionally, speech act theory classifies speech acts into several kinds of illocutionary acts <ref> [19, 21] </ref>. In this paper, I consider the classes of assertives, directives, commissives, permis-sives, prohibitives, and declaratives. Briefly, assertives are statements of fact; directives are commands, requests or suggestions; commissives, e.g., promises, commit the speaker to a course of action; permissives issue permissions; and prohibitives take them away. <p> Further constraints on when requests and commands are satisfied may be stated that capture their non-semantic aspects properly. In speech act theory, an illocution or speech act is usually seen to have two parts: an illo-cutionary force and a proposition <ref> [19] </ref>. The illocutionary force distinguishes, e.g., a command from a promise; the proposition describes the state of the world that is, respectively, commanded or promised.

I have argued at many places in this paper that traditional approaches to formalizing speech acts ignore the aspects of them focused on here. <p> In this section, I compare this paper to some semantics of speech acts that others have proposed. One important work is that of Searle & Vanderveken <ref> [21] </ref>. However, they do not relate the satisfaction conditions of different sorts of speech acts with the intentions and know-how of the speaker or the hearer.

Reference-contexts: These applications are in a number of areas of Computer Science, including the following. 1. Distributed Computing. The initial specifications of distributed systems and protocols that human designers and ultimate users come up with often are in terms of the speech acts performed by the processes in a system <ref> [24] </ref>. A semantics would make precise notions such as permission and promise that are commonly used|though used only informally. Having precise definitions would help in designing reliable systems and would facilitate the debugging of their specifications relative to the desires of their ultimate users. 2.

Reference-contexts: I present a formal theory that gives the semantics of several different kinds of speech acts. This theory uses the concepts of know-how and intentions as primitives. The technical framework of this paper follows the ones developed previously to formalize know-how and intentions <ref> [25, 26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This helps eliminate cases where the speaker has the intention, but is not in the right social or conventional position to make the declarative succeed|the naming should succeed, but not because of some contingent features of the given scenario. According to some traditional theories, e.g., that of Vanderveken <ref> [27] </ref>, the occurrence of declaratives merely coincides with their success. This seems too weak since it allows a declarative to succeed even if the speaker did not have full control over its occurrence, i.e., even if the speaker could not have forced the given condition to occur. <p> He proposes that a default mechanism, in his paper Reiter's default logic, be used to characterize the effects of speech acts and, hence, their pragmatic content. In more recent work, Vanderveken has independently addressed the problems of the "success and satisfaction" of speech acts <ref> [27, 28] </ref>. Vanderveken's goal is a general illocutionary logic, and a large part of his theory is focused on the conditions of when a performative succeeds, i.e., when a speech act of a particular illocutionary force is made. <p> For example, for him a directive is satisfied if the appropriate condition comes to hold, and a prohibitive, merely a special kind of directive for him, is satisfied if the appropriate condition does not occur. He lumps permissives and prohibitives with directives <ref> [27, pp. 189-198] </ref>, 22 which I have argued should not be done. Vanderveken also does not consider the temporal aspect of speech acts explicitly.

Reference-contexts: subordinate clause really makes sense with the missing performative verb inserted, e.g., as ". . . , I tell you to buy new tires." In other syntactic work, Vendler classified the so-called performative verbs, such as "order" and "entreat," on various dimensions, e.g., of the kinds of objects they take <ref> [29] </ref>. This data explains certain facts about performatives and their differences from, and similarities with, attitudinal verbs. 2.2 Pragmatics Much of the work on speech acts in pragmatics has been about identifying the illocutionary force of a speech act.
