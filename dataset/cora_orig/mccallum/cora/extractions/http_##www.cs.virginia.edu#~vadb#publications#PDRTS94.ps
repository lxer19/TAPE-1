Abstract: We are also examining inclusion of run-time estimates for various commands within the server which will enable it to offer a choice of service to clients whose work cannot be completed in the time allotted: imprecise results or a missed deadline. Conceivably some clients might wish to simply exclude some queries which might introduce incomplete results, and terminate as quickly as possible. These execution estimates would be maintained in a table in the server and will be based on several factors such as relation file size, query type, media types involved, and current resource utilization. Properly implementing such a heuristic mechanism will require carefully controlled execution timing, and some consideration of the temporal impact of held data locks. In addition to real-time requirements, security is usually required in many real-time applications, because sensitive information must be safeguarded. Multilevel security requirements introduce a new dimension to transaction processing in real-time systems [Son93]. We started to investigate several issues that must be addressed for developing a secure real-time database server, and plan to use RTDB as a testbed for experimentation. [Abb89] Abbott, R. and H.
