Abstract: Non-parametric density estimation is the problem of approximating the values of a probability density function, given samples from the associated distribution. Non-parametric estimation finds applications in discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, and flow calculations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Usual estimators make use of kernel functions, and require on the order of n 2 arithmetic operations to evaluate the density at n sample points. We describe a sequence of special weight functions which requires almost linear number of operations in n for the same computation.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The use of probability density estimation in data analysis is well established <ref> [15, 12, 11, 2] </ref>. In the non-parametric case no assumption is made about the type of the distribution from which the samples are drawn. <p> We performed 5 deviation 1. 6 experiments with a sum of fi distributions in the form 0:35 fi (6; 2) + 0:65 fi (2; 6) generated by the rejection-acceptance method.

It is evident that compared with a unimodal distribution, more samples are required to get accurate results. line represents the true density.

Reference-contexts: However in time this usually leads to mesh distortion and numerical difficulties. Problems with mesh distortion can be eliminated to a certain extent by the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) <ref> [9, 4] </ref>. SPH treats the points being tracked as samples drawn from an unknown probability distribution. Because of the iterative nature of SPH, density is estimated at every time step, and the efficiency of the computational aspects becomes even more important.
