Abstract: Polycultural agroecosystems, such as rangelands, are too complex and poorly understood to permit precise numerical simulation. Management decisions that depend on behavioral predictions of such ecosystems therefore require a variety of knowledge sources and reasoning techniques. Our approach to designing a computer system that provides advice concerning such ecosystems is to incorporate various reasoning paradigms and apply whatever paradigm is most appropriate to each task arising in the advice process. This approach is based on a particular process description of expert human problem solving that uses four different reasoning paradigms: model-based reasoning; case-based reasoning; rule-based reasoning; and statistical reasoning. The process description is implemented in CARMA, a computer system for advising ranchers about the best response to rangeland grasshopper infestations. CARMA attempts to emulate the human ability to integrate multiple knowledge sources and reasoning techniques in a flexible and opportunistic fashion. The goal of this approach is to enable computer systems to optimize the use of the diverse and incomplete knowledge sources and to produce patterns of reasoning that resemble those of human decision-makers.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach has been to use simulation techniques to derive the expert's final answer without attempting to duplicate the expert's reasoning process <ref> (Batchelor & McClendon 1989) </ref>. For example, Rodell (1978) describes a large-scale numerical simulation model for grassland ecosystems. However, there is a growing recognition that no single reasoning technique is sufficient per se for complex natural resources problems.

Reference-contexts: CARMA differs in that its prototypical cases have only abstract features, whereas PROTOS past cases are described in terms of observable features. CABARET (Rissland & Skalak 1989) and GREBE <ref> (Branting & Porter 1991) </ref> are architectures designed to permit either rules or cases to apply to problemsolving goals. GREBE uses rules to improve case matching by inferring case facts and reformulating open-textured terms. CABARET's agenda mechanism uses heuristics to choose dynamically between rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning.

Reference-contexts: ANAPRON <ref> (Golding & Rosenbloom 1991) </ref> combines cases and rules to solve problems by using cases to represent exceptions to predictions made by the rules. However, this approach is not applicable to domains such as rangeland ecosystems, where cases and models are the main predictive components.

Reference-contexts: However, large-scale grasshopper outbreaks are capable of inflicting serious economic damage to western livestock producers. On average, grasshoppers annually consume 21-23% of western rangeland forage, at an estimated loss of $400 million <ref> (Hewitt & Onsager 1983) </ref>. For example, in 1985-86, Wyoming treated approximately 6.5 million acres at a cost of $22.75 million to private, state and federal interests.

Reference-contexts: The decision whether to use insecticides or other control measures is a complex task because of the multiplicity of relevant factors, such as maintaining minimal inputs for profitable ranching in the western United States, preserving natural enemies for chronic control of grasshoppers <ref> (Joern & Gaines 1990) </ref>, safeguarding biodiversity, and protecting environmental and human health. Management of rangeland grasshoppers requires a variety of knowledge sources.

Reference-contexts: Specific cases have been found to be an important knowledge source in a variety of problem domains in which precise general rules are unavailable or inadequate <ref> (Klein & Calderwood 1988) </ref>. <p> CARMA represents a continuation of the trend toward incorporation of multiple reasoning paradigms to more effectively model human expert performance and to compensate for incomplete or uncertain knowledge. There is psychological evidence that much of human problemsolving uses past cases <ref> (Klein & Calderwood 1988) </ref>. In particular, it is our observation that entomologists and pest managers reason with prototypical cases in rangeland grasshopper management. CARMA illustrates how case-based reasoning can be integrated with other reasoning paradigms for natural resources management.

Reference-contexts: Integration of CBR and MBR Several previous research projects have investigated the benefits of integrating case-based reasoning with model-based reasoning (MBR). However, these projects have generally assumed the existence of a correct and complete causal model. For example, CASEY <ref> (Koton 1988) </ref> performed medical diagnosis using model-based reasoning to assist both case matching and case adaptation. However, CASEY presupposed both the existence of a complete causal theory of heart disease and complete explanations of each case in terms of that theory.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, a model-based system might become easier to use (especially for a novice) when combined with rules that interpret model results, e.g., COMAX <ref> (Lemmon 1986) </ref>. CARMA represents a continuation of the trend toward incorporation of multiple reasoning paradigms to more effectively model human expert performance and to compensate for incomplete or uncertain knowledge. There is psychological evidence that much of human problemsolving uses past cases (Klein & Calderwood 1988).

Reference-contexts: CARMA implements the process description of entomological problem solving set forth in the previous section. CARMA was originally implemented as a purely case-based reasoning system using the PROTOS case-based reasoning shell <ref> (Porter, Bareiss, & Holte 1990) </ref>. However, this implementation proved to be a poor model of expert problem solving in this domain. PROTOS is designed to produce a diagnostic category as a solution. <p> CARMA's use of model-based reasoning for case matching and adaptation represents an alternative approach to integrating CBR and MBR appropriate for domains characterized by an incomplete causal model. Integration of CBR and RBR Several projects have combined case-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning (RBR). PROTOS <ref> (Porter, Bareiss, & Holte 1990) </ref> uses rules to reason about the degree of equivalence between features in different cases in a technique called knowledge-based matching. In effect, PROTOS attempts to infer matching abstract features from nonmatching observable features. <p> In effect, PROTOS attempts to infer matching abstract features from nonmatching observable features. An ablation study demonstrated that the use of rules for matching contributes significantly to PROTOS's performance <ref> (Porter, Bareiss, & Holte 1990) </ref>. CARMA's technique of inferring abstract features in a new case in order to establish a match with a prototypical case is similar to this approach.
