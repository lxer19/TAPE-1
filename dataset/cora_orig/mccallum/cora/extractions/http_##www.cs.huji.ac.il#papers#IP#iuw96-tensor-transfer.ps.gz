Abstract: The recently discovered "trilinear tensor" has been shown to play a similar role to the "fundamental" matrix, but with three instead of two perspective views, in representing the relative motion parameters of an observer moving in the 3D projective world. The issue of a general representation for any number of views remains an open problem. The main result presented here is captured by two operators on tensors that together enable a closed-form concatenation of any number of views. The concatenation operation shows that N tensors are sufficient for representing N + 2 views, i.e., the tensor of any triplet of views from the N +2 set, can be generated in closed-form from an arbitrary collection of N tensors. These concatenation operators may be useful in the context of image synthe sis, image mosaicing and video compression.

It appears we have three separate sets of 27 coefficients, one for each image playing the role of the first image <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> . What we show next is the extension to the three views case, namely that there is a simple, closed form, transformation among the three sets of 27 coefficients (i.e., among the three tensors). This goes as follows.

Reference-contexts: Another possibility is based on the recent finding that tensors across certain arrangements of triplets of views occupy a low-dimensional subspace of the space of all tensors <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> | however, that result is more about finding a measure of consistency over many views, than a representation of a collection of views. The approach closest to ours is that of [ 8 ] that suggested to concatenate the N (N 1)=2 fundamental matrices. <p> This is true because a linear combination of homography matrices is an homography matrix <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> . We have, therefore, described a closed-form formula for transforming a tensor T (i;j;k) to tensor T (j;i;k) . And we have, Theorem 1 (Tensor Permutation) The tensor T (j;i;k) can be obtained from tensor T (i;j;k) via transformation of its coefficients alone.

Reference-contexts: For example, the "fundamental" matrix F between and 0 can be linearly determined from the tensor by: E j which yields 18 linear equations of rank 8 for F . More details can be found in <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> . The final detail we will need is related to invariance of two views. <p> Thus each E j is a collineation from 1 onto 2 associated with a plane whose orientation is determined by 3 (the exact manner in which the orientation depends on 3 can be found in <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> , but is not important here). Likewise, each G j is a collineation from 2 onto 1 , but since 3 has not changed, these collineations correspond to the same planes as E j do.
