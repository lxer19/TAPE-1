Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This article presents an efficient, implemented approach to cross-linguistic parsing based on Government-Binding (GB) Theory <ref> (Chomsky, 1986) </ref> and followers. One of the drawbacks to alternative GB-based parsing approaches is that they generally adopt a filter-based paradigm. <p> If we assume, following <ref> (Chomsky, 1986) </ref>, that relative clause formation involves movement from an inner clause into an outer subject position, then the gram-maticality of the above example suggests that the Trace theory must be parameterized so that crossing more than one barrier is allowed in Korean.

Even more significant is the negligible difference in processing time between the two languages, despite radical differences in structure, particularly with respect to head-complement positioning.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is similar to that of (Lin, 1993) in that structure building is deferred until the descriptions satisfy all principles; however, the current approach differs in that it provides a parameterization mechanism along the lines of <ref> (Dorr, 1994) </ref> that allows the system to be ported to languages other than English. We focus particularly on the problem of processing head-final languages such as Korean. <p> In the English network, all phrasal heads precede their complements. In head-final languages such as Korean, the reverse order is required. In order to capture this distinction, we incorporate the parameterization approach of <ref> (Dorr, 1994) </ref> into the message-passing framework so that grammar networks can be automatically generated on a per-language basis.

Reference-contexts: Linear ordering is indicated by the starting points of links. For example, C precedes IP in the English network of figure 1. 3 The idea of constraint application through feature passing among nodes is analogous to techniques applied in the TINA spoken language system <ref> (Seneff, 1992) </ref> except that, in our design, the grammar network is a static data structure; it is not dynamically modified during the parsing process. Thus, we achieve a reduction space requirements.

Reference-contexts: Message Passing Paradigm There has been a great deal of interest in exploring new paradigms of parsing, especially non-traditional parallel architectures for natural language processing (Abney, 1989; Cot-trell, 1989; Selman and Hirst, 1985) (among many others). Recent work <ref> (Stevenson, 1994) </ref> provides a survey of symbolic, non-symbolic, and hybrid approaches.

Reference-contexts: The result is that a head-final language such as Korean is as efficiently parsed as a head-initial language such as English. What is most interesting about this approach is that model is consistent with experimental results (see, for example, <ref> (Suh, 1993) </ref>) which suggest that constituent structure is computed prior to the appearance of the head in Korean.

Reference-contexts: We then present the parameterization framework, demonstrating the feasibility of handling cross-linguistic variation within the message-passing framework. A technique for automatic precompila-tion of parameter settings is described. Finally, we compare the efficiency of the parser to that of the original CFG algorithm as well as Tomita's algorithm <ref> (Tomita, 1986) </ref> on a test suite of representative sentences. We argue that the efficiency of the system is not simply a side effect of using an efficient programming language (i.e., C++), but that the algorithm is inherently efficient, independent of the programming language used for the implementation. 2. <p> The test sentences are from <ref> (Tomita, 1986) </ref>. There are 40 of them. The sentence lengths vary from 1 to 34 words with an average of 15.18. Both CFG parsers use the Grammar III in (Tomita, 1986, p.172-6), which contains 220 rules, and small lexicon containing only the words that appear in the test sentences. <p> The test sentences are from (Tomita, 1986).

The lexicon in PRINCIPAR, on the other hand, contains about 90,000 entries extracted from machine readable dictionaries. 7 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 2 semantic representation are well-defined.
