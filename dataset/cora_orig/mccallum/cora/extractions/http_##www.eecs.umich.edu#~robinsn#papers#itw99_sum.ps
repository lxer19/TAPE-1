Abstract: In this paper, we present the unconstrained and constrained CramerRao (CR) bounds for estimation of shape parameters in resolutionlimited imaging. The Bspline model is used to represent the boundary of object. Analysis of asymptotic CR bound indicates that for fixed perimeter, disk shaped objects are the easiest to estimate and that flower shaped objects are the hardest to estimate among the class of objects representable by the Bspline basis.

Reference-contexts: Observe that for a given shape, can be decreased by decreasing oe s or by magnifying the shape by a factor m (i.e.) when r (OE) is replaced by mr (OE) for m &gt; 1. The quantity q 2 fi (OE) is known as the speed <ref> [4] </ref> of the curve and measures the distance tra versed by particle moving along the curve r (OE) per change in angle 4OE. Suppose g () is any integrable scalar function.
