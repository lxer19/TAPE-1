Title: Image Segmentation with Alpha Maps

Note: Ph.D. Thesis Proposal:  
Abstract: This proposal describes a segmentation algorithm for "natural" images. Based on the premise that adjacent regions differ in their color distributions, the compass operator is developed to detect boundaries. Scale is a critical factor in segmentation, and we propose using pattern recognition to combine results from different scales into a probability distribution at each pixel. This distribution measures the likelihood that a pixel should be given a label of texture, micro-boundary, or macro-boundary. Global constraints are imposed by using these distributions to guide a relaxation algorithm that will produce the final segmentation. In addition, we propose defining a boundary as a region rather than a curve, in which a pixel may fractionally belong to multiple image regions. Borrowing the concept of an alpha map from graphics, we estimate the percentage that each image region contributes to the color of a boundary pixel. The result will be a better representation of an image boundary that will have applications in image-based rendering, as the alpha values will allow a region to blend smoothly into a different background.

Reference-contexts: The second is that our novel boundary model, detailed in Section 1.6, would be difficult to fit into a region-based method. 1.3 Natural Images Despite increasing complexity, no descriptor proposed by the texture community has demonstrably captured the infinite variety of textures in images. Attneave <ref> [1] </ref> makes two important points in this regard. The first is that texture involves "abstracting certain statistical homogeneities" from part of an image containing a large amount of redundant information. The second is that there are as many different types of redundancy as there are of regularity. <p> This can be solved by the following 3 fi 3 system, 2 d 1 d 2 0 1 1 1 5 4 p 2 3 2 0 1 5 ; in closed form. Because strength is theoretically continuous on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, it is impossible that any of the distances would be zero, but if it were to occur we would simply make that probability equal to 1. In summary, we can be assured that our probabilities will intuitively represent the distances.

Reference-contexts: Textures in the natural world are warped, continuously rotated, changing in frequency, noisy, and not parallel to the image plane. Avoiding these problems casts doubt on the robustness of a given algorithm. Recent work by Belongie and Malik <ref> [2] </ref> is a step in the right direction. They use differences of Gaus-sians and differences of offset Gaussians as a filter bank, appended with intensity information, to perform perceptual grouping on natural images of animals, landscapes, buildings, and people.

Reference-contexts: Malik and Perona [15], in their classic paper modeling early vision mechanisms, computed a texture gradient from smoothed postinhibition responses. Gabor filters form an important class of operators because they are bandpass filters that are jointly optimal in space and frequency. Bovik, Clark, and Geisler <ref> [3] </ref> detected both amplitude and phase differences in the frequency responses. Dunn, Higgins, and Wake-ley [5] analyzed the behavior of Gabor filter responses and found that different types of preattentive texture boundaries produced steps, valleys, ridges, or step changes in the average local output variation.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we will use relaxation techniques to achieve a final result that satisfies global constraints while maintaining fidelity to 10 the posterior distributions. 3.1 The Use of Pattern Recognition Pattern recognition, according to <ref> [4] </ref>, is the assignment of a physical object or event to a number of pre-specified classes. Over the last 30 years thousands of articles have been written about the automation of visual pattern recognition tasks. <p> Given a new sample from an image, the class label is chosen to minimize the probability of error given the assumptions implied by the class models <ref> [4] </ref>. are [0; 0:1), [0:1; 0:2), etc. class over the range of scales. The error bars indicate the variance. Creating a decision rule from the models in this particular case is ill-advised because important information from neighboring pixels is ignored.

Reference-contexts: Pixels in the texture region will have an alpha value of 1. Pixels in the boundary region with nonzero alpha values are also part of the alpha map. Alpha values may be estimated using soft filling algorithms from graphics <ref> [6] </ref>. We assume that the color of a pixel is a linear combination of 2-4 basis colors in the image; therefore, it must lie in an affine subspace of the CIE-Lab color space [7]. We can use linear algebra to determine the coefficients of each basis color.

Reference-contexts: Our goal will be to find the member of this minimal energy subset while remaining true to the original estimate, our posterior distributions. A major part of the research which has yet to be investigated is an enhancement of the classic stochastic relaxation algorithm proposed by Geman and Geman <ref> [8] </ref> to deal with this particular problem. Traditionally, when updating a site the energies resulting from a switch of that site's label to every other label is computed and made into a conditional probability distribution, from which the site's new label is chosen. <p> The goal is to search for the member of this set that most closely matches the initial data. Because the search space has many local minima, randomized algorithms are often used. These techniques were developed in the context of image restoration <ref> [8] </ref> and have also been used for texture segmentation (for in 15 (a) "Texture" (b) "Micro-boundaries" (c) "Macro-boundaries" for the Encantadora image. Dark values represent high probabilities. stance, [16]).

Reference-contexts: While this algorithm is accurate, it can sometimes produce well over 200 clusters in colorful images at large scales. A number between 10 and 20 would be preferable in most cases. A clustering algorithm (or vector quantizer, see <ref> [9] </ref>) assumes that the cluster centers are points (vectors) in R d . A natural generalization would have the cluster centers be higher-dimensional structures in R d . Specifically, we propose allowing cluster centers to be line segments in the three-dimensional CIE-Lab color space.

Reference-contexts: Triendl and Henderson [26] first found edges in each output of a number of texture filters. The edges were then grouped across outputs and spatially within a single output.

Reference-contexts: Khotanzad and Chen [14] estimated the parameters of image windows using a simultaneous autoregressive random field model. The n greatest Sobel responses over the parameter values at a point were used to compute the "textural change," which was thinned and thresholded for the final output.

Reference-contexts: At each step, either a region is split because the descriptors of its subregions fail the homogeneity predicate, or two adjacent regions with similar descriptors are merged.

The main advantage of region-based methods is that they are guaranteed to produce boundaries that are connected at each end to other boundaries or to the image border. The biggest limitation is that the results are usually oversegmented, more so than we would like with a syntactic segmentation.

Reference-contexts: At each scale, a gradient was computed from all the features by averaging the output of finer operators and/or ignoring the output of coarser ones.

Reference-contexts: The histograms measured the frequency of gray-level patterns over 3 fi 3 neighborhoods. Histograms were also used by Voorhees and Poggio [27], but their representation was based on blobs and the distance measure was the maximum L 1 distance over the bins.

Given the probability distributions for each pixel in an image, we want to find the labeling that matches this data while satisfying a number of other constraints. Because this part of the research has yet to be investigated in detail, the constraints we describe are only speculative.

Reference-contexts: Distances are measured with the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which has been shown to approximate perceptual distances between color distributions of entire images [24]. The EMD is a solution to the transportation problem <ref> [18] </ref>, which seeks the minimum amount of work needed to transform one mass distribution into another. Each mass represents a color, and the distance between two colors is a normalized measure of their perceptual dissimilarity. We use the CIE-Lab color space [28], which is perceptually accurate for small distances.

Reference-contexts: The biggest limitation is that the results are usually oversegmented, more so than we would like with a syntactic segmentation. This is because the homogeneity predicate is global, while many surfaces are only locally homogeneous due to shading, perspective, etc. One solution, proposed in <ref> [20] </ref>, merges the closest pair of inhomogeneous regions until the ratio between successive merges is above a threshold. Unfortunately, this threshold is not the same for all images. Because of the widespread availability of clustering techniques, region-based methods are more popular than edge-based methods.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we should be able to detect most of the ridges in the En-cantadora image easily, but to extend them we will need the relaxation techniques of Section 1.5. 1.4 The Problem of Scale It has been argued <ref> [21] </ref> that objects in the world are approximations to fractals because they exhibit self-similarity, but only at a limited range of scales. Recovery of this scale information is important for all image features, including boundaries.

Reference-contexts: In many cases, the boundary is a chain of adjacent pixels with the understanding that the true boundary is actually a chain of line segments joining the points represented by the pixels. Some implementations (for instance, <ref> [22] </ref>) define boundaries to be "sub-pixel," but this is achieved using an inter-pixel lattice, which increases the resolution but does not change the nature of the boundary. There are two problems with these formulations.

Reference-contexts: Future experiments will compare segmentation results using color distributions with those obtained by intensity distributions and other descriptors. We choose to represent our distributions as signatures, proposed in <ref> [24] </ref>, which are variable-size sets of clusters. Each cluster consists of a point in a color space and the amount of that color present in an image patch. The main advantage over a histogram, a fixed-size descriptor, is that signatures are more flexible. <p> Imagine that one signature is represented by piles of dirt and the other is represented by a set of holes. Then the distance between the signatures is the minimal amount of work required to push the dirt into the holes <ref> [24] </ref>. This distance measure is the basis for the compass 2 operator. At each point in the image we find the orientation of a diameter of a circle centered at that point that maximizes the EMD between the signatures of the semicircles. <p> Distances are measured with the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which has been shown to approximate perceptual distances between color distributions of entire images <ref> [24] </ref>. The EMD is a solution to the transportation problem [18], which seeks the minimum amount of work needed to transform one mass distribution into another. Each mass represents a color, and the distance between two colors is a normalized measure of their perceptual dissimilarity.

Pixels in the texture region will have an alpha value of 1.
