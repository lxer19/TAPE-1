Abstract: This paper reports the results of our empirical study of Java Inter-Process Communications (IPC) performance in WindowsNT environment. The study is performed under a set of PentiumPro 200 MHz computers running WindowsNT 4.0. These computers are connected by a 10 Mbps Ethernet local area network. Various experiments are conducted including simple message passing, echoing, various size of file transfer, and Web access. The data revealed some anomaly in Java IPC among other normal, expected results. A major result is that the message transfer rate increases as the size of the messages increases to a certain point where the transfer rate is flattened. The file transfer rate is more affected by the file size on local file system than the size of the messages that transfer the file over the network.

Reference-contexts: Java as a programming language is gaining acceptance very quickly for its architecture independent virtual machine design and for its easy interface to the World Wide Web. Java now is used very commonly in Internet related applications because its built-in networking and inter-process communication capabilities <ref> (Cornell and Horstmann 1997) </ref>. The combination of WindowsNT and Java makes a unique, powerful environment for Internet related services such as World Wide Web access. In this paper, we report our results of empirical study of the performance of Java inter-process communication (IPC) in WindowsNT operating system environment.

Reference-contexts: When measuring access performance to a Web server, the web server used is a Pentium90 with 64 Mbytes of memory. It is located in a different segment of the LAN. The Java interpreter used Microsoft Visual J ++ <ref> (Siyan 1996) </ref>. Performance metrics: The performance metrics in our study is simply the wall-clock time. All experiments are repeated 10 times and the average is taken to get some statistical significance.
