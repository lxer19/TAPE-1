Reference-contexts: A list is consists of a left parenthesis followed by an arbitrary number of data elements (including lists) followed by a right parenthesis. All non-list data are either decimal signed integers, or quoted strings following the syntactic rules of Scheme <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. 1 In summary, a string is a sequence of characters between two double quotes (ASCII value 34) where literal double quotes in the string are represented by a backslash (ASCII value 108) followed by a double quote, and where literal backslashes are represented by two consecutive backslashes.

Reference-contexts: Global objects are allocated with a special storage allocator (called new G ) which returns a global pointer to the object. A global pointer can be operated on in restricted ways outlined in the HPC++ white paper <ref> [3] </ref>. A barrier is always a global event: all threads participate in a barrier. 4 Interaction Model Abstractly, there is one communication channel which connects the debugger and the debuggee. As outlined in section 1, the present document considers this channel to be abstract.
