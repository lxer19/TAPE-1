Abstract: The first generation of active database systems attracted interest in both the academic and the industrial communities. However the paradigm it is based upon suffers from some intrinsic problems, such as: non deterministic execution and possible redundant operations. This paper reports on these problems and on the design of TAPUZ, a second generation active database system that is aimed at reducing these problems, yet maintains the same goals and functionalities of the first generation. The main features of this model are: the use of high-level invariant language, yet enable the use of auxiliary procedural programming when required. A dependency-graph based control model is used to provide a deterministic and well-defined semantics for the execution process.
