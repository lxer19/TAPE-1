Here, we use instead a parallel numerical cell decomposition algorithm, whose output is a description of the C-regions, their boundary curves, and their adjacency relationships. The algorithm is divided into the following steps (figure 7): 1.

Reference-contexts: Of course, force-closure grasps can occur with one finger at a concave vertex (figure 6): the force exerted by this finger may lie anywhere in the friction cones of the incident curves or in the region separating them [ Buckley, 1987 ] (see <ref> [ Brost, 1991 ] </ref> for a general discussion of friction models at vertex contacts). The corresponding force-closure 10 grasps can be characterized by modifying the force-closure constraints to take into account this larger friction cone.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we are investigating an active coupling of grasp planning with visual perception. This will involve extracting the information necessary for grasping a three-dimensional object from a sequence of video images, combining the geometry of the imaging process (maybe modelled as in <ref> [ Kriegman and Ponce, 1990 ] </ref> ) with the geometry of grasping.

Reference-contexts: This allows us to characterize force-closure grasps by systems of polynomial constraints in the parameters of these curves. All configuration space regions satisfying these constraints are found by a parallel numerical cell decomposition 4 algorithm based on curve tracing <ref> [ Kriegman and Ponce, 1991 ] </ref> and continuation techniques [ Morgan, 1987 ] . Maximal object segments where fingers can be positioned independently are found by optimizing the size of rectangles enclosed in the grasp regions. <p> The correction step uses Newton iterations to converge back to the curve along the u 2 direction. Both steps involve inverting a Jacobian matrix guaranteed to be nonsingular on each extrema-free interval I ij . See <ref> [ Kriegman and Ponce, 1991 ] </ref> for details. Note that the algorithm explicitly addresses the two major difficulties of curve tracing: finding sample points on each real branch of the curve, and marching through singularities.

This approach has been fully implemented using a network of SUN Sparc Stations to perform the parallel part of the grasp planning computations. <p> To solve these equations, we use a global numerical technique known as homotopy continuation <ref> [ Morgan, 1987 ] </ref> . Continuation is itself a form of curve tracing: Suppose we want to compute all isolated roots of a system of n polynomial equations in n unknowns, f (x) = 0.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, we consider force-closure grasps, such that arbitrary forces and torques exerted in the plane of the grasped object can be balanced by the contact forces exerted by the fingers. We assume hard point contact with friction. The geometry of force-closure grasps has been studied in <ref> [ Ohwovoriole, 1980; Nguyen, 1988 ] </ref> . <p> This paper extends Nguyen's work on the construction of force-closure grasps of polygonal objects <ref> [ Nguyen, 1988 ] </ref> to the case of piecewise-smooth curved objects. Like him, we characterize two-finger force-closure grasps by the fact that the line segment joining the contact points must lie within the friction cones at these points (figure 1). <p> Here, we are concerned with the case of a two-finger gripper grasping a two-dimensional object by closing its fingers around it, and we assume hard point contact with Coulomb friction. Nguyen <ref> [ Nguyen, 1988 ] </ref> has shown that, under these assumptions, force-closure grasps can be characterized by the fact that the line segment joining the contact points must lie within the friction cones at these points (figure 1). <p> It should be noted that force-closure grasps can also be obtained by moving the fingers away from each other instead of squeezing. The latter grasps are characterized by the fact that the contact points lie in each other's external friction cone <ref> [ Nguyen, 1988 ] </ref> , which can 8 be expressed by reversing the sign of the inequalities in (1). The algorithm described in next section has only been implemented for squeezing grasps. The above force-closure constraints define regions in the grasp configuration space where all configurations are stable. <p> We would like to find 9 pairs of contour arcs such that any point on the first arc and any point on the second one form a stable grasp <ref> [ Nguyen, 1988 ] </ref> . In configuration space, such pairs correspond to rectangles with sides parallel to the axes that are contained in stable grasp C-regions.

(See <ref> [ Pollard and Lozano-Perez, 1990 ] </ref> for a discussion of related problems.) As noted in section 2, we have also neglected a number 25 of important physical constraints that affect the stability of grasps and their robustness in the presence of uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: Corners are found as local extrema of curvature above some threshold, and they are used to split the original contour into subparts. Curvature is estimated by using a program kindly provided by Regis Vaillant from INRIA <ref> [ Vaillant, 1990 ] </ref> . Briefly, this program first computes a spline approximation of the contour using the Numerical Analysis Group (NAG) library of numerical routines, and then computes orientation and curvature analytically from the spline representation.
