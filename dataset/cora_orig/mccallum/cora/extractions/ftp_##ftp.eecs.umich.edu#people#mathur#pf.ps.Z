Abstract: We consider the problem of providing reliable group communication support for large-scale distributed systems over IP Multicast-based networks. We observe that the semantics of a group multicast protocol are intimately related to the semantics of the shared object state that the multicast is modifying. We present a novel object-centric formulation of the group multicast problem which we refer to as the Group State Synchronization Problem (GSSP). The GSSP formulation is done at the object level and allows different objects in the mul-ticast group to have different and more appropriate reliability semantics. We present protocols for solving GSSP and for achieving the various reliability semantics.

Reference-contexts: This involves ensuring that the processes agree on the set of operations to be applied, and ensuring that the the operations get applied in a meaningful order. In other words, ensuring consistency of the shared state involves reliable delivery of updates and ordering of updates <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. In this paper we focus on the reliability problem, results from our earlier work on ordering [3] can be easily integrated with this work.
