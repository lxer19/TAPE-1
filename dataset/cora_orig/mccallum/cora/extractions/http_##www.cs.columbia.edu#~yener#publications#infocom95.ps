Abstract: This paper presents a new design methodology and tools to construct a switch-based LAN with (i) scalable throughput, (ii) no loss due to congestion, and (iii) two routing modes: FIFO or non-FIFO. More specifically, given a bounded degree (number of switch ports) at each node, the design is based on the construction of multiple virtual rings under the following constraints: (i) the virtual rings are pairwise edge-disjoint, and (ii) there is at least one virtual ring between any pair of nodes. The target topology is obtained from the edge union of the multiple virtual rings. The objectives of the above two constraints are (i) to ensure no loss due to congestion inside the network of bursty traffic sources, and (ii) to ensure convergence of packets/cells to their destinations.

Since the multiple virtual rings are edge-disjoint, no link can be a default link for two distinct packets. Thus, no contention is possible on the default links. Furthermore, a packet is routed to a link different than its default one, only if that link is available.

Reference-contexts: The techniques yield to a target network on which the maximum length of routing is bounded by O ( p N ) independent of the traffic characteristics. We note that previous approaches to multiple ring topology design (i.e. chordal rings), such as <ref> [14, 4] </ref>, report designs with similar bounds on the routing length. However, this is achieved by compromising congestion-free routing, and in addition, failures may result in deadlocks in these designs.

Reference-contexts: Inside the network, the default routing of a packet is along its current virtual ring, which means that each routing decision decreases the distance from the destination by one.

In order to ensure no loss, a packet has priority over all other packets for continuing on its ring as a default (this priority is the same as the ring traffic priority in buffer insertion rings).

Reference-contexts: The notion of embedding a single virtual ring in an arbitrary network was put forth in the MetaNet architecture <ref> [10, 11, 12] </ref> design (a virtual ring is embedded over a tree in a closed tour). However, this construction does not utilize all the ports of a switch since only a subset of the links are included to the virtual ring. <p> Once the spanning trees are constructed, a virtual ring can be embedded on each tree with a directed Euler tour (i.e., tree embedded ring TER <ref> [10] </ref>). For the sake of simplicity we will limit the global virtual ring embeddings to the Hamiltonian constructions in this paper. 3.1 Construction of the Network The target network is regular and symmetric, and obtained by taking the edge-union of the virtual rings. <p> global sense of direction. (In case of partial rings, the sense of direction is local to the nodes sharing the ring.) Consequently, in contrast with the other deflection routing algorithms, our algorithm ensures (i) bounded and (ii) guaranteed (unless a failure occurs) delivery of a packet to its destination (see <ref> [10] </ref>). Therefore, we call this scheme multi-ring convergence routing. The routing algorithm follows the following three principles: 1. A packet sent from node A to node B enters the network via one of its d virtual nodes. <p> The priority of the default routing of a packet is realized by marking the next ring link to the destination of this packet (see <ref> [10] </ref>). 3. Inside the network a packet can be switched to another ring if the distance from the destination on the other ring is smaller from the current distance. This kind of switching is possible only if the next ring link on the other ring is available. <p> The switch is used for transferring packets from the links buffers (LBs) (a fixed size LB is a associated with the receiving side of each link) to the host or the out-going links, and to transfer packets from the host to the out-going links <ref> [10] </ref>. In particular, when a node has a packet for transmitting, it puts the packet in the output buffer and decides over what output link to send (the access to the node output buffer is exclusive to the processor mechanism).
