Reference-contexts: An illustrative example is the AAS, the proposed next-generation air-traffic control (ATC) system contracted by the American FAA. 3 3 The discussion of the AAS presented here draws heavily on <ref> [1] </ref>. 5 The AAS was originally intended to use the relatively mature delta-T atomic broadcast technology. Although the delta-T technology seemed intuitively well-matched for the AAS needs, it had two shortcoming which had to be addressed: 1. <p> effort was "a nearly inevitable outcome, because the fundamental theoretical research was not in place to solve this kind of problem [i.e., the marriage of two or more high assurance properties], and because the existing theoretical results were not reflected in a corresponding integrated, scalable, and commercially viable software infrastructure." <ref> [1] </ref> Extrapolating from the inability to achieve hard real-time constraints and fault-tolerance in a single system, it is clear that the basic research is also lacking to achieve the integration of either of these properties and security or safety.

Reference-contexts: One of the critical functions performed by the device is bradycardia therapy, which delivers a low energy pacing pulse to the patient's 2 The discussion of this system presented here draws heavily on <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 heart when a slow beat is detected. This provides the patient with a mini-mum life-sustaining heart rate. The device also delivers tachycardia therapy, which delivers a high energy shock to the patient when an abnormally fast heart beat is detected.
