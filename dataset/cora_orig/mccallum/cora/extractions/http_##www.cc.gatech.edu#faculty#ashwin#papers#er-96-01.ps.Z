Abstract: In Proceedings of the 18th Annual Cognitive Science Conference, San Diego, CA, July 1996 This paper can also be found at the Georgia Tech WWW site: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/cogsci/ Abstract Successful creative understanding requires that a reasoner be able to manipulate known concepts in order to understand novel ones. A major problem arises, however, when one considers exactly how these manipulations are to be bounded. If a bound is imposed which is too loose, the reasoner is likely to create bizarre understandings rather than useful creative ones. On the other hand, if the bound is too tight, the reasoner will not have the flexibility needed to deal with a wide range of creative understanding experiences. Our approach is to make use of a principled ontology as one source of reasonable bounding. This allows our creative understanding theory to have good explanatory power about the process while allowing the computer implementation of the theory (the ISAAC system) to be flexible without being bizarre in the task domain of reading science fiction short stories.

Pocket Books, New York. 3 A similar problem arises in research involved with the formation of novel concepts (see, </title> <journal> e.g., </journal> <note> Shoben, 1993; Ward, 1995; Wisniewski & Medin, </note> <year> 1994). </year> <title> If a novel concept is formed using existing concepts, what category should the new concept belong to? For example, if pet and fish are combined, where in a knowledge hierarchy should the resulting concept be placed? Barsalou, </title> <editor> L.

Reference-contexts: More information on the reading aspects of the model can be found in Moorman and Ram (1994b). ISAAC is currently capable of reading three short, previously published, science fiction stories (one to three pages), as well as several paragraph synopses of Star Trek: The Original Series episodes <ref> (Asherman, 1989) </ref>. In addition, several small examples have been studied, outside the context of reading complete stories. We now present several of these to show the extent which the ontology aids the creative understanding process. First, we return to the original example: John was a bear.

Reference-contexts: The first involves altering an existing physical agent to create a variant of it, an intracellular movement. The second involves shifting a physical object to the physical agent cell, a vertical movement. The intracellular movement is preferred. In the story Men Are Different <ref> (Bloch, 1963) </ref>, a robotic archaeologist is studying the destroyed civilization of mankind. The story is presented as a first-person narrative.

Reference-contexts: Another major ontological division is the object-event distinctionsome things in the world are objects (like rocks, people, etc.) while other things are events (such as walking) <ref> (Carey, 1992) </ref>. The second aspect of the previous research to note is the recognition that shifting basic ontological categories is difficult. Numerous researchers have noticed and theorized about this (e.g., Carey, 1992; Chi, 1993), but one of the best descriptions of the possible range of changes comes from Thagard (1992).

Reference-contexts: The traditional role of slots exists in the system as data objects on the node, which contain pointers to other nodes in the memory. These design decisions were driven to allow flexible storage and retrieval of concepts via a spreading activation model of memory <ref> (Francis & Ram, 1993) </ref>. Consider the robot example in Figure 2. HEIGHT-IS is a pointer to a relationship schema containing general information about height.

Reference-contexts: Within this ordering, however, operations which result in the minimal changes are preferred over those which are more complex. Implementation Details and Examples The ISAAC system is the a computer system which instantiates our creative reading theory. ISAAC is written in Common Lisp, using the KR frame package <ref> (Giuse, 1990) </ref> for knowledge representation, the Garnet package (Myers, 1988) for graphical input and output, and the COMPERE system (Ma-hesh, 1993) for comprehending individual sentences. While the system is specifically designed to be a testbed for our theory of creative understanding, the complete reading theory is implemented.

D., editors, </editor> <title> 100 Great Science Fiction Short Short Stories. </title> <publisher> Doubleday, </publisher> <address> Garden City, NY. </address>
Reference-contexts: ISAAC can create a new type of robot which embodies agent-like aspects, or it can change the definitions of narrators, archaeologists, protagonists, and the actions in which they may participate. The new robot concept represents a more minimal change. The final example involves the story Zoo <ref> (Hoch, 1978) </ref>, in which the reader is presented with an intergalactic zoo which travels from planet to planet, giving the inhabitants of those planets a chance to view exotic creatures.

Reference-contexts: Through this transition, we get many common similes and metaphors, such as Hungry as a bear and As good as gold. * Agents and objects can easily transition between each other. This results from two observations. First, agents exist as embodied entities in the world <ref> (Johnson, 1987) </ref>, explaining the agent to object transition. For example, one may treat John as a physical object. Second, it is possible to view objects as though they possess intention (Newell, 1981), enabling the object to agent transition.

Reference-contexts: The Creative Understanding Process In order to comprehend texts with novel concepts, we hypothesize the use of a creative understanding process <ref> (Moorman & Ram, 1994c) </ref>, made up of four tasks: memory retrieval, analogy, base-constructive analogy, and problem reformulation. When a concept is presented to the reasoner, the memory task is used to discover if it is previously known.

For example, one may treat John as a physical object. Second, it is possible to view objects as though they possess intention <ref> (Newell, 1981) </ref>, enabling the object to agent transition. For instance, a thermostat may be thought of in terms of agency, i.e., it wants to keep the house at a constant temperature. * Make the minimal changes necessary. This is simply a general rule, ala Occam's Razor.

Reference-contexts: This aspect of the work draws heavily from research in artificial intelligence concerning exactly what elements should make up a proper knowledge representation. Although the ideas of both semantic networks and frame representations go back decades <ref> (see, for example, Quillian, 1966 and Minsky, 1975, respectively) </ref>, the structure of knowledge within many artificial intelligence systems is ad-hoc. A notable exception is that of Wilensky's work (1986) with KODIAK, which motivated much of our current approach.

Reference-contexts: With all the possibilities, the least movement occurs if we simply allow John to be the name of a particular bear. Thus, this is the version that ISAAC prefers, if no additional information from the story is provided. 2 A second example comes from the Meta-AQUA system <ref> (Ram & Cox, 1994) </ref> which reads a story involving a drug-sniffing dog. Meta-AQUA initially knows only that dogs will bark at agents which threaten them. But, in the story, a dog is barking at a suitcase.
