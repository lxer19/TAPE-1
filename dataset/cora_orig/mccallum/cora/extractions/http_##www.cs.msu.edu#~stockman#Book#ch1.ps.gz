Reference: 1. <editor> The input image is of a paper containing typing and it is scanned using a page scanner. </editor> <title> Our overall objective is to recognize most of the typed characters and make an ASCII file so that we can edit the text using a word processor. </title>
Reference: 2. <editor> The input image is an X-ray of someone's head. </editor> <title> We would like to find bullets or tumors as regions of 0's in a background of 1's. </title>
Reference: 3. <editor> The input image is a satellite image of a county near Richmond,VA taken in Spring. </editor> <title> By tuning the sensor or by some simple computer algorithm, we would like to create an image where a 0' indicates the presence of an azalea bush and a 1' indicates no bush. </title>
Reference: 4. <institution> We want to check the width of the stem of an auto engine valve by just counting the number of pixels across its shadow. </institution> <note> Since we will be making hundreds of thousands of valves per day, detailed control of the environment and costly equipment can be justified. </note>
