Abstract: User interface technology has advanced rapidly in recent years. Incorporating new developments in existing systems could result in substantial improvements in usability, thereby improving performance and user satisfaction, while shortening training and reducing error rates. We describe low-effort, high-payoff strategies that focus attention on improvements to data display and entry, consistency, messages, documentation, system access and additional functionality. We report on experience from six projects, describing observations, recommendations and outcomes. We close with guidance for managers and designers who are responsible for user interface reengineering.

Reference-contexts: ACCESS has reduced the workload of the reference staff at the help-desk, allowing them to help advanced users with complex searches. Telepathology (Corabi) Our analysis of a remotely-controlled microscope developed by a small firm, Corabi Telemetrics, for pathologists, identified key issues like time delays, incomplete feedback and interference <ref> (Carr, Hasegawa, Lemmon & Plaisant, 1992) </ref>. Home Automation (CCS) At Custom Command Systems, we evaluated a home automation system for security, lighting, entertainment, and climate control (Plaisant, Shneiderman and Battaglia, 1990). Home owners used touchscreens mounted in the walls or cabinetry to control all the equipment in their house.

Reference-contexts: Micro-anatomy (NLM) At the National Library of Medicine, we critiqued and redesigned the interface of the MicroAnatomy Visual Library System, an interactive computer system that allows library patrons or students to view videodisk images of human cell structures <ref> (Chimera & Shneiderman, 1993) </ref>. Network management (HNS) For Hughes Network Systems, we evaluated a complex satellite network configuration system based on numerous overlapping forms.

Reference-contexts: Questionnaire: Administer questionnaires to get user feedback. Another valuable tool we used for evaluating existing user interfaces was QUIS, the Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction <ref> (Chin, Diehl & Norman, 1988) </ref>. It was developed by the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory at University of Maryland, and is used widely in industry and 6 academia, for evaluating 71 interface features. It can be customized to suit the specific system being evaluated.

Reference-contexts: Reengineering can be defined as the examination and alteration of a system to reconstitute it in a new form, and the subsequent implementation of the new form (Chikofsky & Cross, 1990). Process reengineering requires looking at fundamental processes of the business from a cross-functional perspective <ref> (Hammer, 1990) </ref>. Any mode of reengineering would involve reengineering the business process as well, but this paper, focuses only on redesigning the user interface of 2 existing systems. Although business processes may be affected, extensive revamping of the business process is beyond the scope of user interface reengineering.

INTRODUCTION Substantial user interface research and design experience has led to an increasingly deep understanding of design principles (Hix & Hartson, 1993; Nielsen, 1993; Shneiderman, 1997). Incorporating the new developments in user interface technology could greatly enhance the usability of existing systems <ref> (Landauer, 1995) </ref>. We use the term "user interface reengineering" to describe the process of redesigning an existing interface, to improve user performance and satisfaction, while shortening learning time and reducing error rates.

Reference-contexts: Making the interface more consistent results in faster learning, higher performance speed, lower error rate and better retention over time system <ref> (Mahajan & Shneiderman, 1996) </ref>. In all six projects, we suggested improvements in the consistency of the terminology used, the sequence of operations, the screen headers, the field labels and the screen colors.

Reference-contexts: entirely master within the scope of our project but several problems were identified and our short terms recommendations have been found useful. 3 Library card catalog (LC) We worked with the Library of Congress staff to improve access to the library online catalog for first-time users and eliminated training classes <ref> (Marchionini, Ashley & Korzendorfer, 1993) </ref>. The existing command driven online interface to the catalog, SCORPIO, was given a colorful touchscreen interface called ACCESS, designed to serve first time users. ACCESS has reduced the workload of the reference staff at the help-desk, allowing them to help advanced users with complex searches.

Reference-contexts: The challenge for developers is to understand how the old user interface was designed and conceived (Moran and Carroll, 1995), and what constraints the new user interface must respect <ref> (Merlo, Gagne, Girard, Kontogiannis, Hendren, Panangaden & Mori, 1995) </ref>. Case studies of user interface redesign have shown that benefits for users or companies can be sizable (Tullis, 1981; Burns et al., 1986; Egan et al., 1989).

Reference-contexts: This can be compensated by spending more time observing users doing their work (see next section). Discussions with users have to be carefully planned. During our informal discussions with DJJ users, identifying ourselves and gaining their confidence was of utmost importance <ref> (Rose, Shneiderman & Plaisant, 1995) </ref>. Learning the work culture, and adapting to it, goes a long way in winning support. Soliciting comments on overall system performance, and asking open-ended questions, will help in identifying problems users face in daily use of the system.
