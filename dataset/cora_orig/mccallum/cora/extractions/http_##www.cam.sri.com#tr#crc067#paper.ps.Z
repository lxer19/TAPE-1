Abstract: We describe two methods relevant to multilingual machine translation systems, which can be used to port linguistic data (grammars, lexicons and transfer rules) between systems used for processing related languages. The methods are fully implemented within the Spoken Language Translator system, and were used to create versions of the system for two new language pairs using only a month of expert effort.

Reference-contexts: The parts of the system of central interest here are the rule-based components, in particular the morphologies, grammars, lexica and transfer rules. Morphologies are written in a variant of two-level morphology <ref> (Carter, 1995) </ref>, and grammars in a unification-based formalism (Alshawi (ed), 1992). <p> But in practice, the set of composed rules produced is good enough that it can be improved quickly to an acceptable level of performance. Our methodology for performing this task makes use of rationally constructed, balanced domain corpora to focus the effort on frequently occurring problems <ref> (Rayner, Bouillon and Carter, 1995) </ref>. It involves making declarations to reduce the overgeneration of composed rules; adding hand-coded rules to fill coverage holes; and adjusting preferences.

Reference-contexts: All of the translation modules involved operate within the same Air Travel Inquiry (ATIS; <ref> (Hemphill et al., 1990) </ref>) domain as other versions of SLT, using a vocabulary of about 1 500 source-language stem entries, and have been integrated into the main SLT system to produce versions which can perform credible translation of spoken Swedish into French and spoken English into Danish respectively.

Reference-contexts: The language-processing (translation) part of the system is supplied with N-best sentence hypotheses by the system's recognizer, and itself uses a hybrid architecture, which combines rules and trainable statistical models. To summarize the argument from <ref> (Rayner and Bouillon, 1995) </ref>, there are good reasons for requiring both these components to be present. Rules are useful for capturing many kinds of regular linguistic facts that are independent of any particular domain of application, prime examples being grammatical agreement and question-formation. <p> But in practice, the set of composed rules produced is good enough that it can be improved quickly to an acceptable level of performance.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes two related approaches in this general direction, which have been successfully applied within the Spoken Language Translator (SLT) project <ref> (Rayner and Carter, 1997) </ref>. The first is the most obvious: we start with a functioning grammar and lexicon for L 1 , and port it to the similar language L 2 . <p> In contrast, there are other types of phenomena which intuitively are more naturally conceptualized as idiosyncratic and domain-dependent: the most obvious examples here are word-choice problems. The system uses two translation mechanisms, applied bottom-up in parallel <ref> (Rayner and Carter, 1997) </ref>. The primary, rule-based translation mechanism performs transfer at the level of Quasi-Logical Form (QLF), a type of predicate/argument style notation (Alshawi et al., 1991). The source- and target-language grammars provide a declarative definition of a many-to-many mapping between surface form and QLF.
