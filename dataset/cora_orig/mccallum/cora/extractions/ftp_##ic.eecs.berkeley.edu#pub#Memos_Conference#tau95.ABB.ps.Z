Title: Timing-Safe Replaceability for Combinational Designs

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of verifying that a combinational design is a timing-safe replacement for an existing design without making any assumptions about the environment of the design. A replacement condition is formulated which guarantees that if an original design is replaced by a new design, the interacting environment cannot detect the change by observing the input-output behavior of the design as a function of time. A decision procedure is presented for determining whether a replacement design satisfies the replacement condition.

Reference-contexts: Part of this complexity is inherent, since the problem is trivially NP-hard (reduction from SAT). Given the existence of highly efficient packages for the linear theory of &lt; <ref> [2] </ref>, it may be possible to successfully perform the check on medium sized designs; this would cover fair number of asynchronous modules which tend to be small (10-15 gates). We are investigating this possibility.

Reference-contexts: Hence a design is a set of implementations; each implementation having a set of fixed delays. Each implementation has a timing behavior, a Boolean function of time (TBF <ref> [3] </ref>), which characterizes for any set of input waveforms, the set of output waveforms. A design D 1 will be considered a timing-safe replacement for design D 2 if for all TBF's of D 1 there exists a TBF of D 2 with identical timing behavior. <p> This is denoted a timed Boolean function (TBF) in <ref> [3] </ref>.
