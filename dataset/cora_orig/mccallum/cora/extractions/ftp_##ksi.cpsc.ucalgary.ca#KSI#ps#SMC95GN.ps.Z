Title: Knowledge Systematization in the International IMS Research Program  
Author: B.R.Gaines and D.H.Norrie

Abstract: The international Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) research program is an attempt to systematize and make operational worldwide knowledge of advanced manufacturing systems as a basis for new paradigms. This paper gives an overview of the IMS objectives, the six test cases to date, and the proposed future research activities. It describes the coordination of the IMS GNOSIS test case, concerned with knowledge systematization to support the full manufacturing life cycle. The systematic acceleration of scientific research was a major objective of the proposed Japanese Human Frontier research program. IMS is one of the first attempts to achieve such acceleration on a large-scale, and the paper concludes with a discussion of the need for system-theoretic models for the complex socio-technical systems involved in international collaborative research.

Reference-contexts: There are now many examples of effective distributed projects and research collaboration over the Internet <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. This paper reports on one such example which is particularly interesting because it follows the normative example of the Human Frontier program and has been treated as an experiment in international research collaboration by the nations involved.

Reference-contexts: In March 1986, in preparation for the Group of 7 Tokyo summit, the Japanese embassy sent out a press release proposing a Human Frontier program for the systematic acceleration of scientific research through international collaboration <ref> [2] </ref>. It was motivated by the desire to combat US protectionism by demonstrating a Japanese contribution to basic research [11], and, perhaps because of this, it did not gain acceptance by other nations.

Reference-contexts: However, the fundamental notions underlying the proposal, that basic research could be systematically accelerated through a programmatic approach based on international collaboration were sound and timely, and have become recurrent themes in strategic initiatives for new research programs <ref> [3] </ref>. Advances in computer and communication technology have made the environment for programmatic research very different in the 1990s from that in the 1960s. It is no coincidence that DARPA was the driving force behind the formation of what became the Internet in the 1980s.

Reference-contexts: There are models of human society that treat it as a layered system of compound entities in which individuals, groups, and organizations are functional agents, each recursive subdivisions of humanity itself conceptualized as an intelligent agent <ref> [4, 13, 18] </ref>. From such a collective stance, the GNOSIS project may be seen as an intelligent compound entity consisting of distributed agents coordinated through the communication systems described in the previous section (Figure 9).

Reference-contexts: The M e d i at o r implementation is based on groupware concept-mapping tools that were already in use for indexing multimedia materials <ref> [7] </ref>. through layered concepts maps. The map in the window at the upper left is a top level Server Agent that manages a particular collection of material. In the example shown a local user is accessing material directly through this agent.
