Reference-contexts: The safety test is very closely related to the satisfiability problem, for which there is a large body of technique available. For recent experimental work on default reasoning in particular, consult <ref> [3] </ref>. 24

Reference-contexts: One can therefore think of the class as defined by Boolean expressions, where the basic expressions are just NP predicates. By contrast, the polynomial hierarchy (PH) is a classification of languages starting with P, the polynomial-time decidable languages <ref> [4] </ref>. Instead of chaining together finitely many NP oracle calls, as in the BH, we allow polynomially many calls as a function of the input size. Formally we have the following.

Reference-contexts: See below.) This result (by changing the model) improves on similar results of Gottlob <ref> [5] </ref>, who proves that classical default reasoning is complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. In some sense, our problem is quite close to being a co-NP problem. <p> The "dual" of this problem (existential quantifiers first) was used by Gottlob <ref> [5] </ref> and Stillman [12] to show hardness of various reasoning tasks in default logic and other non-monotonic logics. It is quite likely, should currently accepted conjectures on complexity theory be true, that no reduction to BH will be possible from the complete QBE problem above.

Reference-contexts: This system is summarized below in Section 4. We also assume familiarity with standard terminology on partially ordered sets, and finally we assume familiarity with standard default logic. To introduce the Smyth powerdomain, we paraphrase from Gunter and Scott's introduction <ref> [6] </ref> to pow-erdomain theory. Later we will use the example to introduce default constraints.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the safe instances of conjunctive systems have a polynomial-time entailment algorithm. * In the case of conjunctive systems where the desired "default conclusion" is in DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form), the whole normal skeptical inference problem is polynomial. This contrasts sharply with results of Kautz and Selman <ref> [7] </ref>, who show NP-hardness results for similar (normal) instances in standard default logic. * In our system, we can carry out default reasoning by cases, something not possible in standard default logic. * Reasoning in our system also obeys the desirable law of Cautious Monotony [8].

Cautious Monotony generally fails to hold in standard default logic. <p> We then have a co-NP algorithm for this purpose. 8 Cumulativity In this section we show that excepting the same entailment problems where OE is not true, our system obeys the Cautious Monotony law of Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor <ref> [8] </ref>. This law is one of the patterns of inference said to form a "core" collection of rules for any reasonable logical non-monotonic reasoning system. It reads as follows, where now j is some sort of general relation between formulas.

Here is a summary of the advantages of our method. * We isolate an important subclass of problem instances for which there is a simple co-NP test for deciding skeptical non-monotonic entailment. These are the so-called safe instances. <p> We insist that all default conclusions be clauses with at most two literals, and that OE is in DNF. We consider a decision procedure for 2-SAT, and adapt it to return a satisfier of a 2CNF formula when that formula is satisfiable. (For example, the procedure in <ref> [9, Theorem 9.1] </ref> is appropriate.) Now, define a sequence hx k i starting with one of the minimal satisfiers of OE.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 General remarks We present in this paper some initial results on the computational complexity of normal propositional default inference, using a new semantics based entirely on Reiter's ideas in developing default logic <ref> [10] </ref>, but where normal defaults appear not as proof rules, but in the model theory of the logic. (Reiter's extensions are therefore now model-theoretic constructs.) The new semantics is that of power defaults, which we have introduced in another paper [11]. <p> We take R to be the extension relation, due to Reiter <ref> [10] </ref> in the case where the domain X is the domain of closed first-order theories. Definition 3.2 Let (X; v) be a Scott domain. Let be a default set in X.

Reference-contexts: semantics based entirely on Reiter's ideas in developing default logic [10], but where normal defaults appear not as proof rules, but in the model theory of the logic. (Reiter's extensions are therefore now model-theoretic constructs.) The new semantics is that of power defaults, which we have introduced in another paper <ref> [11] </ref>. The main result here is that skeptical non-monotonic inference is a complete problem for co-NP (3), the third level of the Boolean hierarchy (BH). (A slightly more general version is in fact NP (4)-complete, but it adds an uninteresting special case. <p> What price do we pay for the advantages claimed above? The cost is in learning the semantic system, which is derived using Scott's domain theory, the theory of complete partially ordered sets; and one construction of that theory, the so-called Smyth powerdomain. We study the powerdomain semantics in <ref> [11] </ref>, where we show a so-called extension splitting theorem which sanctions default reasoning by cases. In that paper, we also show that our semantics adapts smoothly to the first-order setting and avoids many of the semantic problems with open default rules.
