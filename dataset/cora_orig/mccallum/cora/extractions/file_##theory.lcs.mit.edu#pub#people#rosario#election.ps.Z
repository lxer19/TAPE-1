Title: A Secure and Optimally Efficient Multi-Authority Election Scheme  
Author: Ronald Cramer Rosario Gennaro Berry Schoenmakers 
Date: March 3, 1997  
Abstract: In this paper we present a new multi-authority secret-ballot election scheme that guarantees privacy, universal verifiability, and robustness. It is the first scheme for which the performance is optimal in the sense that time and communication complexity is minimal both for the individual voters and the authorities. An interesting property of the scheme is that the time and communication complexity for the voter is independent of the number of authorities. A voter simply posts a single encrypted message accompanied by a compact proof that it contains a valid vote. Our result is complementary to the result by Cramer, Franklin, Schoenmakers, and Yung in the sense that in their scheme the work for voters is linear in the number of authorities but can be instantiated to yield information-theoretic privacy, while in our scheme the voter's effort is independent of the number of authorities but always provides computational privacy-protection. We will also point out that the majority of proposed voting schemes provide computational privacy only (often without even considering the lack of information-theoretic privacy), and that our new scheme is by far superior to those schemes.

Reference-contexts: This protocol is directly related to the protocol for "simultaneous dicrete log" by Chaum, Evertse, and van de Graaf [CEG88]. Both protocols, being public-coin ones, can be made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. Alternatively, there is a four-move, O (k) zero-knowledge protocol due to Chaum [Cha91] (see <ref> [BCDP91] </ref> for a proof). This protocol is not public-coin though, which means that it requires interaction. 2.5 Homomorphic encryption Homomorphic encryption schemes form an important tool for achieving universally verifiable election schemes. A general definition of the notion is as follows. Let E denote a probabilistic encryption scheme.

In Section 5 we describe an alternative construction related to the hardness of factoring. 1.4 Coercion Benaloh and Tuinstra in <ref> [BT94] </ref> introduced the notion of a receipt for electronic election schemes. They showed how previous election protocols all suffer from a common defect: a voter can carry away from the protocol a receipt that proves the way he voted. <p> Note that for the scheme of [CFSY96] the use of the private channels is limited to two elements of ZZ q per channel. 6.2 Incoercible protocols Receipt-free or incoercible election scheme that have been proposed so far all rely on some form of physical assumption <ref> [BT94, NR94, SK95] </ref>. The minimal assumption required (as in [SK95]) is the existence of a private channel between the voters and the authorities.

Reference-contexts: Their scheme is based on a new type of encryption called deniable encryption introduced in <ref> [CDNO96] </ref> that allows a sender to encrypt a bit b in such a way that the resulting ciphertext can be "explained" as either b or 1 b to a coercer.

Reference-contexts: The crux is to keep this proof O (k), and here we follow the approach of [CFSY96]. We will need a novel application of the technique of <ref> [CDS94] </ref> for constructing efficient witness hiding protocols. The resulting proof of validity is a little bit more complicated than in [CFSY96], but still requires only a few modular exponentiations. <p> An efficient protocol for this problem is due to Chaum and Pedersen [CP93], see Figure 1. This protocol is not known to be zero-knowledge or witness hiding. The following result however suffices for our application (see also <ref> [CDS94] </ref> for definitions of the notions involved). 2 The private channels assumed in Pedersen's key generation protocol may be implemented using public key encryption and the bulletin board. <p> By the techniques of <ref> [CDS94] </ref>, we can now immediately obtain a very efficient witness indistinguishable proof of knowledge for the above relation. To prove either of the two equalities we have the efficient proof of knowledge by Chaum and Pedersen, described above, for which we have prepared Lemma 1. <p> To prove either of the two equalities we have the efficient proof of knowledge by Chaum and Pedersen, described above, for which we have prepared Lemma 1. On account of this lemma, we have that the protocol exactly satisfies the conditions for the construction of <ref> [CDS94] </ref>. See Figure 2 for a preview of the protocol, as it is used in the election scheme of the next section. 3 Multi-authority election scheme Given the primitives of the previous section we now assemble a simple and efficient election scheme. <p> This amounts to showing that x = ff q Y v , for some ff, with v 2 f1; 1g, hence that either x=Y or xY is a q-th residue. As before, Lemma 2 below guarantees the existence of an efficient proof of validity, based on the construction of <ref> [CDS94] </ref>. Lemma 2 The protocol of Figure 3 is a three-move, public coin proof of knowledge for r-th residuosity. The proof satisfies special soundness, and is special honest-verifier zero-knowledge. Proof Completeness of the proof of knowledge is clear.

Reference-contexts: The drawback is that the complexity of the resulting protocol is O (k 2 ). This protocol is directly related to the protocol for "simultaneous dicrete log" by Chaum, Evertse, and van de Graaf <ref> [CEG88] </ref>. Both protocols, being public-coin ones, can be made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. Alternatively, there is a four-move, O (k) zero-knowledge protocol due to Chaum [Cha91] (see [BCDP91] for a proof).

Reference-contexts: Compared to the scheme of <ref> [CFSY96] </ref>, we thus achieve a reduction of the work for each participant by a factor of n. In the new scheme, the voter just sends a particular ElGamal encryption of the vote plus a proof that it indeed contains a valid vote. <p> The proof prevents the voters from casting bogus ballots, and should be such that no information whatsoever leaks about the actual vote contained in a ballot. The crux is to keep this proof O (k), and here we follow the approach of <ref> [CFSY96] </ref>. We will need a novel application of the technique of [CDS94] for constructing efficient witness hiding protocols.

We will need a novel application of the technique of [CDS94] for constructing efficient witness hiding protocols. The resulting proof of validity is a little bit more complicated than in [CFSY96], but still requires only a few modular exponentiations. A proof of knowledge similar to our proof of validity has been used by Chen and Pedersen to construct efficient group signatures [CP95]. <p> The correctness of the decryption will be assured, even in the presence of malicious authorities. Apart from achieving a strong set of properties, three major achievements of our scheme are: (i) The work required of the voter is minimal. Compared to <ref> [CFSY96] </ref> the work is reduced by a multiplicative factor of n. Although n is usually much smaller than k, this is still a substantial gain in practice. <p> To show that the same masking technique as in <ref> [SK94, CFSY96] </ref> can be used, we instantiate the scheme of Section 2.6 with m 1 = G and m 0 = 1=G, where G is a fixed generator of G q . <p> Since challenge c can be chosen freely, we also have special honest-verifier zero-knowledge. 2 12 Theorem 2 Under the q-th residuosity assumption, our election scheme provides universal verifiability, computational privacy, robustness, and prevents vote duplication. 6 Discussion 6.1 Information-theoretically secure elections The scheme of <ref> [CFSY96] </ref> in principle provides information-theoretic protection of the voter's privacy. This is due to the fact that voters post (a number of) information-theoretically hiding commitments to the bulletin board and that these commitments are opened to the authorities using private channels. <p> Anybody sees if the voter abstains from posting the required values to the bulletin board. If what the voter submits consists of incorrect shares, the respective authorities open the commitments to the key so that this fact can be verified. Note that for the scheme of <ref> [CFSY96] </ref> the use of the private channels is limited to two elements of ZZ q per channel. 6.2 Incoercible protocols Receipt-free or incoercible election scheme that have been proposed so far all rely on some form of physical assumption [BT94, NR94, SK95]. <p> For example, for the discrete log scheme, we have for jpj = 64 bytes and jqj = 20 bytes, that the size of the ballot plus its proof plus a signature on it is only 272 bytes in total. Clearly, this is an order of magnitude better than <ref> [CFSY96] </ref>, which was already two orders of magnitude better than any previous scheme. Furthermore, computation of the ballot and its proof require a few exponentiations only (see Figure 2). A direct consequence of the reduced ballot size is also that the task of verifying the final tally is much simpler.

Reference-contexts: This receipt can then be used for vote buying or for coercion. Several incoercible schemes have been presented since the introduction of the concept (see <ref> [SK95, NR94, CG96] </ref>). <p> pointed out in the 13 previous section, the use of private channels gives rise to disputes. (Another viable approach is to assume that the voters dispose of a tamper-proof encryption box such as a smartcard, but we consider this beyond the scope of this paper.) Recently, Canetti and Gennaro in <ref> [CG96] </ref> proved that general secure multiparty computation protocols can be made incoercible without the above assumptions, in particular without assuming untappable channels. <p> Their scheme is based on a new type of encryption called deniable encryption introduced in [CDNO96] that allows a sender to encrypt a bit b in such a way that the resulting ciphertext can be "explained" as either b or 1 b to a coercer. The construction in <ref> [CG96] </ref> works for the general problem of secure multi-party computation; as such it is described in terms of a complete network of communication and the result holds as long as at most half of the players in the network are coerced.

For the case of election schemes, the construction of [CG96] can be scaled down to the bulletin board model (thus not requiring communication between voters). In this model all voters can withstand coercion provided the coercer is not able to prescribe the random bits of the voters, and at most half of the authorities can be completely coerced.

Reference-contexts: To this end, we will employ fault-tolerant threshold cryptosystems instead of (verifiable) secret sharing schemes. In our case there will be only one public key for which the matching private key is shared among the authorities using threshold cryptography techniques (see <ref> [Des94] </ref> for a survey.) The voter posts the ballot encrypted with the public key of the authorities. The private key is never reconstructed, and only used implicitly when the authorities cooperate to decrypt the final tally. <p> See <ref> [Des94] </ref> for a survey. The main protocols of a threshold system are (i) a key generation protocol to generate the private key jointly by the receivers, and (ii) a decryption protocol to jointly decrypt a ciphertext without explicitly reconstructing the private key.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, jumping ahead a little, in order to make our protocols noninteractive, the verifier will be implemented using either a trusted source of random bits (a beacon as in [Rab83, Ben87]) or using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic <ref> [FS87] </ref> which requires a hash function. In the latter case security is obtained for the random oracle model. If so desired, a perfect zero-knowledge protocol secure against any verifier can be obtained by replacing the challenge space ZZ q with f0; 1g and repeating the basic protocol k times.

Reference-contexts: In this case security is retained in the random oracle model, but some care is required to prevent vote duplication.

We note that the use of threshold cryptography instead of secret sharing presents also some advantages in this area. Using proactive security techniques (see <ref> [HJKY95, HJJ + 95, FGMY96] </ref>) it is possible to leave the public key of the system in place for a really long time without fearing it being compromised.

Reference-contexts: are authenticated using digital signatures, so it is not possible that a single entity simulates the behavior of n authorities whose public keys are commonly known to the observers. 4 If this O (l) search method is considered too slow for a large-scale election, Shanks' baby-step giant-step algorithm (see, e.g., <ref> [LL90, Section 3.1] </ref>) can be applied to find T in O ( p l) time using O ( p lk) bits of storage. 10 respect to at most n t malicious authorities is inherited from the robustness of the key generation and decryption protocols.

The minimal assumption required (as in [SK95]) is the existence of a private channel between the voters and the authorities.

Reference-contexts: An open 14 problem is to construct efficient incoercible election protocols, preferably without relying on physical assumptions. In our scheme the work for the voter is minimal and independent of the number of authorities. Election schemes based on the mix channel of <ref> [PIK94] </ref> also have this property but for several reasons our approach is preferable over those schemes. In mix-based schemes the final tally is computed by somehow decrypting the individual ballots, while in our approach a single decryption of the aggregate of the ballots suffices. <p> In our case we can tolerate malicious behavior of a constant fraction (half) of authorities. Finally, the security of our scheme can be proven from its construction, while some security problems with the schemes of <ref> [PIK94, SK95] </ref> exist, as shown for instance in [Pfi95, MH96].

Reference-contexts: As an aside we note that the mere use of multiple authorities can be considered a condition as well. Indeed, election protocols have been proposed that try to eliminate this condition, e.g., see <ref> [PW92] </ref>, but the methods used still require conditions regarding the channels connecting the participants.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, jumping ahead a little, in order to make our protocols noninteractive, the verifier will be implemented using either a trusted source of random bits (a beacon as in <ref> [Rab83, Ben87] </ref>) or using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic [FS87] which requires a hash function. In the latter case security is obtained for the random oracle model.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, schemes using anonymous channels or mixes [Cha81] usually rely on computational assumptions. By recovering the private keys of the mixes, an adversary is able to "open" all ballots posted to the first mix. For example, the scheme of <ref> [SK95] </ref> relies on the difficulty of computing discrete logs, both for the secrecy of the mixes' private keys and for the contents of the ballots.
