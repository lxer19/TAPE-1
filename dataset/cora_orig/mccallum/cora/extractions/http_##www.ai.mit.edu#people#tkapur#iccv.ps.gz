Abstract: A method for model based segmentation of 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the human knee is presented. A probabilistic model describing the spatial relationships between features of the human knee is constructed from 3D manually segmented data. In conjunction with feature detection techniques from low-level computer vision, this model is used to segment knee MRI scans in a Bayesian framework.

Reference-contexts: For each point on the surface of the femur in image I t , compute the direction of the local normal. Quantize the direction into 5 uniformly spaced bins between and . 2. Compute the Chamfer <ref> [1] </ref> distance from each point in the image I t to the femur. Saturate the distance at 25 (empirically determined value). 3.

Reference-contexts: We have used a histogram to estimate the density from sample points. Other methods such as Parzen Windowing for density estimation (discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>) could be used effectively as well. density function is localized i.e. has high information content (or low entropy), thereby indicating that d and n are reasonable indicators of the relationship between the femur and its cartilage.

Reference-contexts: 1. Motivation We are interested in segmentation of clinical MRI scans for pre- as well as intra-operative visualization and modeling. Specifically, segmentation will be necessary to provide patient-specific anatomical models for a surgical simulation system <ref> [4] </ref>. In this system, computer-based knee models are combined with physically-based anatomical modeling, high quality visual rendering, and force-reflective interface devices to provide the surgeon with a virtual testbed for planning and rehearsing patient specific procedures. Current knee models for the surgical simulator have been painstakingly hand-segmented by medical professionals.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore the segmentation of large-scale structures at the start of the process offers the possibility of calibrating the gain field, and applying a correction to the pixel intensities before continuing (see <ref> [6] </ref> for details). Our initial work on this approach has looked at the segmentation of just four structures the femur and the femoral cartilage, and the tibia and tibial cartilage but we present the work in terms of the overall framework for a full knee segmentation. <p> To prevent leaks in the texture based region growing, connected contours of edges are used as a heterogeneity criterion i.e. are used to stop the growth of the region. In the second step, the boundary of the bone is localized using a snake-like regularizer that is discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>. the result of the adaptive region growing from that seed, and data. Three orthogonal cross-sections are obtained for a selected location in the data set and are shown in 2D (left column) and 3D (right-side). The atlas is also shown on the 3D display.

Model-Based Method in Knee Segmentation: Solloway et al. <ref> [8] </ref> use a parameterized shape-based method for segmenting femoral cartilage. Their method uses principal component analysis to encode shape and intensity variations across a training set of landmark locations. During segmentation, the mean locations of the landmarks from the training data are superimposed on the image.
