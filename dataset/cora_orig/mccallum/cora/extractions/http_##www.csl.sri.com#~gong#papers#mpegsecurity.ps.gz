Abstract: MPEG (Moving Pictures Expert Group) is an industrial standard for video processing and is widely used in multimedia applications in the Internet. However, no security provision is specified in the standard. We conducted an experimental study of previously proposed selective encryption schemes for MPEG video security. This study showed that these methods are inadequate for sensitive applications. We discuss the tradeoffs between levels of security and computational and compression efficiency.

Reference-contexts: The structure of our experimental system is as shown in Figure 3. We wrote the encryption routine that encrypts video output from a MPEG encoder and modified the MPEG encoder code accordingly. More specifically we used the parallel MPEG-1 encoder developed at SRI <ref> [1] </ref> and the MPEG-2 encoder by Chad Fogg, used DES in cipher-feedback mode to generate a cipher stream, and exclusive-or the cipher stream with the MPEG stream. 1 The routine can optionally encrypt I-frames only, or including all I-blocks also, or all P-frames in addition to all I-blocks.

Reference-contexts: MPEG encoding of a video sequence requires many compression steps. Each frame in the video sequence is compressed using a combination of block-based motion compensation to take advantage of interframe temporal redundancy, and discrete cosine transform (DCT)-based compression to take advantage of in-traframe spatial redundancy <ref> [2] </ref>. Each frame (or picture) in the sequence is broken into 8 fi 8 pixel blocks for interframe DCT compression and 16 fi 16 pixel macroblocks for intraframe motion compensation. <p> Our experiments generally confirm the trend illustrated in Figure 11. and bandwidth consumption 5 Summary and Future Work MPEG-1 (and MPEG-2) is a popular standard for video processing and is widely used in applications such as desk-top video conferencing <ref> [2] </ref>. Given currently available hardware and software encryption devices and the demand in MPEG usage, it is commonly accepted that encrypting the full MPEG stream would be too slow for real-time applications, especially in an environment such as the Internet.

Reference-contexts: By restricting the encryption and decryption to the I-frames, this method reduces the cryptographic computation by half. This reduction is significant because the decryption of the I-frames and I-blocks can take as much as one-third of the decoding time [6]. However, a little cryptanalysis (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>) would reveal that, although a single P- or B-frame on its own is meaningless without the corresponding I-frame, a series of P- or B-frames carries much information if their base frames are correlated.

The MPEG bit streams also contain resynchronization signals, for correcting transmission errors that also reduce the security of the transmission. MPEG uses an asymmetric coding model where encoding requires substantially more computational power than decoding.

Reference-contexts: For example, Maples and Spanos perform real-time, software encryption using selective encoding of the I-frames. The encryption was performed on a 486-class machine for ATM transmission <ref> [5] </ref>. In this work, the headers and the I-frames in the MPEG stream are encrypted using DES encryption in the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode [8]. The CBC mode is a commonly used operation mode of DES and has the ability to recover property from bit-errors. <p> A special encoder and decoder would be required to view unencrypted SECM-PEG bit streams. 3 Weakness in Selective Encryption As mentioned earlier, one proposed selective encryption algorithm encrypts only the I-frames of MPEG video <ref> [5] </ref>. This selective method appears attractive because it can significantly reduce the amount of encryption and decryption. <p> For example, in a MPEG sequence of an ongoing meeting, the base frames (the I-frames) often contain images of the same people in the same surrounding, which are clearly related. Thus we expect that for such MPEG sequences the simple selective encryption method <ref> [5, 6] </ref> would not be able to provide a high level of security. To verify our hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments. The experiment environment and set up is as follows. The structure of our experimental system is as shown in Figure 3. <p> Given currently available hardware and software encryption devices and the demand in MPEG usage, it is commonly accepted that encrypting the full MPEG stream would be too slow for real-time applications, especially in an environment such as the Internet. The selective encryption method <ref> [5, 6] </ref> where the I-frames (and some Copyright (c) 1996 IEEE. 7 An Empirical Study of Secure MPEG Video Transmissions ISOC-SNDSS '96 times I-blocks also) are to be encrypted, has been proposed to be an economical and secure substitute for full encryption.

Reference-contexts: Encryption of the I-frame alone, in theory, would render the information in the P- and B-frames useless. Encrypting base frames alone allows the encryption to be implemented in software in real-time <ref> [6] </ref>. Wholesale encryption and decryption of the MPEG bit-stream would require much faster processing and possibly dedicated hardware. This base-frame encryption scheme does not account for I-blocks (intracoded 8 fi 8 blocks) in the P-and B-frames. Under certain circumstances the security of this scheme falls apart. <p> In another example, Meyer and Gadegast have designed a new MPEG-like bit-stream called SECM-PEG that incorporates selective encryption, additional header information to aid in bit-error recovery, and has high-speed software execution <ref> [6] </ref>. SECMPEG also allows the use of both DES and RSA [7] encryption algorithms. SECMPEG implements four levels of security. At the first level, SECMPEG encrypts the headers from the sequence layer down to the slice layer. The motion vectors and the DCT-coded blocks are unaltered. <p> By restricting the encryption and decryption to the I-frames, this method reduces the cryptographic computation by half.
