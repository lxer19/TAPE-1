Abstract: Description This is an upper-division course on the design and analysis of computer algorithms. This is a course on problem solving, not a programming course. While we will discuss implementation issues occasionally, there will be no programming associated with this course. We will examine several interesting problems, devise algorithms for solving them, prove their correctness, and characterize their cost. Along the way, we will study many useful data structures and core algorithms, ways of designing algorithms to solve problems, and techniques for analyzing these algorithms. Communication My open office hours will be TuTh 9:00-10:00am. Additionally, if the class size is small enough, each student will also have a regularly scheduled "one-on-one" weekly slot of 15 minutes with me. The TA's office hours will be MW 9:30-10:30am, or by appointment. In addition, you are encouraged to communicate via email.
