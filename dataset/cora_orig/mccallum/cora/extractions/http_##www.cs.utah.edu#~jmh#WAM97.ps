Abstract: This paper describes the design of the elastic body of a new torque sensor to measure torsion moment faithfully in the presence of strong overhang and thrust forces as well as bending moments. This feature, in conjunction with high stiffness makes this sensor an ideal choice for robotic applications. The structure inherently exhibits minimum strain sensitivities and compliances to all non-torsional moments and forces such that their effect can easily be cancelled in the Wheatstone bridge circuit. On the other hand, maximum possible local strain sensitivity near the material limit, and maximum torsional stiffness are achieved through the structure's strain concentration characteristic. Several other important design criteria are also discussed, as well. The sensor geometry is analysed and further optimized using the finite element method. The sensor was constructed, and experimental data validated the finite element model and documented the sensor's performance.

Reference-contexts: A direct approach for control is possible when the external load information is available directly by measurement of all joint torques via joint torque sensors. Direct positive feedback of the torque signal can then compensate the dynamics of the robot manipulator <ref> [1, 10, 16] </ref>. Although this approach offers a far simpler control solution than model based control, accurate joint torque measurements encounter several challenges. <p> Substituting * from (1) into (2) we have m z = f s C T v : (3) It is evident from (3) that the output signal is proportional to torsion and independent of the exogenous force/torque components provided C T v = e; (4) where e = <ref> [0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 1] </ref> T . Equation (4) clearly says there exists a gain vector v if the vector e belongs to the range of matrix C T or equivalently in the support space of matrix C [4]. <p> 4 c 2 c 3 c 5 c 6 c 7 c 8 c 1 c 4 c 5 c 6 c 7 c 8 7 5 : This matrix permits the reconstruction of the torsion moment from the output signal with the gain vector v = 1 c 8 <ref> [1; 1; 1; 1] </ref> T . In this case, one can use the additive properties of the Wheatstone bridge to implement the gain vector. In general, provided the gains have identical absolute values, the Wheatstone bridge can achieve decoupling without the need for any subsequent arithmetic.

Reference-contexts: Insensitivity to the other five non-torsional generalized force components provides high corresponding stiffnesses and devotes a higher maximum strain to torsion resulting in high torsional sensitivity in addition to natural decoupling. In commercial torque <ref> [2, 6] </ref> sensors exogenous components are not permitted or are highly restricted. Furthermore, they usually come in bulky packages, and thus they are not suitable for integration in a robot joint. This paper is arranged as follows.

Reference-contexts: There is a large literature on the systematic design of six degree-of-freedom force/torque sensors [7, 17, 19] and on various techniques to instrument geared motors for torque sensing [5, 11, 14, 20], while little attention has been paid to pure joint torque sensing <ref> [3, 9] </ref>. It is important to note that the design criteria for the two types of sensors are very different. For instance, isotropy (i.e. uniform sensitivity) is a desirable property of a six degree-of-freedom force/torque sensor, hence its elastic structure tends to be fragile and compliant in all directions.

Reference-contexts: Equation (4) clearly says there exists a gain vector v if the vector e belongs to the range of matrix C T or equivalently in the support space of matrix C <ref> [4] </ref>. The number of solutions then depends on the rank of matrix C. If rank C &lt; n, then there are infinitely many solutions, and the Moore-Penrose inverse, denoted by C + , can calculate the minimum norm gain vector, v = C + e: elastic element; C: strain gauge.

Reference-contexts: In the design of robot manipulators, it is desirable to contribute much of the torque/force reaction of the link load on the joints in the form of non-torsional components as less actuation efforts are demanded (e.g. the SCARA design <ref> [12] </ref> prevents gravity torques acting on the joint motors). Moreover, in direct-drive robots the torque sensor is directly attached to the motor's distal link. Therefore, they must bear the large non-torsional components of the generalized force/torque vector exerted at the joint called them exogenous components hereafter.

Reference-contexts: The torque sensor is fixed rigidly in one side to a bracket while an aluminium bar is attached to the other side. The end of the bar is connected to a mechanical level via a rope in which a load cell (MLP-50 from Transducer Techniques <ref> [18] </ref>) is installed. The level increases and decreases the tension in the cord gradually from zero to maximum and back to zero. During the loading and unloading, the load cell and the torque sensor outputs are being sampled by a two channel data acquisition system.
