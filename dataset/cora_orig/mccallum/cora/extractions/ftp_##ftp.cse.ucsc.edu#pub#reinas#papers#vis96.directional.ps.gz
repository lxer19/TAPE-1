Abstract: This paper presents interactive flow visualization methods that highlight directional information in the flow field. An added benefit of the proposed methods is that they reduce the amount of data being displayed and hence reduce clutter. The main idea behind these methods is the use of light sources to select and highlight regions in the flow field with similar directions. Varying the lighting conditions, by moving the light source and/or adding more lights, emphasizes different vector directions, set of directions, and vectors within a specified angle of a particular direction. The methods are straight forward, computationally inexpensive, and can be combined with other techniques that use glyph representation and other flow geometry such as streamlines for feature visualization. We apply these methods to an analytic data set to help explain how they work, and then to a simulation data set to highlight flow reversals.

Reference-contexts: This approach is much simpler and faster than the strategy proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> on rendering curves in 3-space. There are several applications that motivate the need for methods that highlight regions of similar flow directions.

Reference-contexts: There are several applications that motivate the need for methods that highlight regions of similar flow directions. Two of those that we worked with and will present in section 4 are: identifying the presence and locations of onshore or offshore flows in weather patterns (e.g. locations of northwesterly flows <ref> [2] </ref>); and identifying presence and locations of flow reversals from free stream flow in CFD simulations.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is similar to Johannsen and Moorhead [5] where vector direction is mapped to hues in a color wheel, but extends the work to 3D vector fields and also add the ability to ability to refine directional search. Unlike Dovey's <ref> [3] </ref> work in vector plots of irregular grids, clutter reduction is achieved by displaying only the relevant vector glyphs instead of resampling and repositioning vector glyphs for the entire field.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, the field exhibits many derivable features such as torsion, curvature, shear, acceleration, and convergence. The difficulty is that there is no single natural way of visualizing entire 3D vector fields that highlights all these features <ref> [4] </ref>. As a result, numerous methods have been developed to visualize these different vector field properties. In this paper we present a new vector visualization technique that emphasizes directional and magnitude information in the the vector field.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, vector magnitude can be mapped to glyph intensity and vector direction interacts with lighting conditions to determine the glyph hue. Our approach is similar to Johannsen and Moorhead <ref> [5] </ref> where vector direction is mapped to hues in a color wheel, but extends the work to 3D vector fields and also add the ability to ability to refine directional search.

Reference-contexts: Both of these can be easily highlighted with the methods described here. 2 DIRECTIONAL FLOW METHODS In this research, we extend the bump mapped vector techniques <ref> [6] </ref> for identifying directional flow in 2D fields to three dimensions. Those techniques actually work with a 2-manifold surface either a 2D planar cross section of a 3D flow field, or a surface in 3D. <p> Hence, we decided to apply the vector direction controlled shading to intermediate flow geometries such as glyphs and streamlines. Shading Cues from Vector Field There are several ways of deriving shading cues from vector fields (e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>). Since we will mostly be using simple 1-manifold geometry (i.e. hedgehog lines and streamlines), and the lack of a natural surface normals for these shapes, we decided to use a straight replacement of the surface normal with the vector direction.

Reference-contexts: with no resampling. 4 RESULTS We tested the 3D directional flow visualization methods on 3 different types of data: (a) analytical data set with simple helical flow to help understand and demonstrate how the method works, (b) meteorological wind data of the Mon-terey Bay area provided through the REINAS project <ref> [7] </ref>, and (c) the Delta wing at 40 degree angle of attack CFD data set (http://chuck.nas.nasa.gov/DataSets/Ekaterinaris.1/index.html) to illustrate flow reversals. Both hedgehog lines and streamlines were used in these data sets.

Reference-contexts: Equation 3 reduces to: H = 300 300 cos () 3 IMPLEMENTATION We implemented our flow visualization techniques using the Visualization ToolKit (VTK) <ref> [8] </ref>. VTK is an object-oriented 3-D graphics library that implements many common visualization methods. VTK provided our main visualization pipeline and many of the methods we used for verifying our techniques including file reading, grid handling, isosurface, streamline, and hedgehog visualization tools.
