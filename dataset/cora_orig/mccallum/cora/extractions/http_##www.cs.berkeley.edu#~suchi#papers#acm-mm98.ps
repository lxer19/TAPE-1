Title: Scalable Data Naming for Application Level Framing in Reliable Multicast  
Author: Suchitra Raman and Steven McCanne

Abstract: The Application Level Framing (ALF) protocol architecture [2] encourages application control over mechanisms that traditionally fall within the "transport layer", e.g., loss detection and recovery. Traditional ARQ-based reliable protocols for unicast (e.g., TCP) as well as multicast (e.g., Horus [30], RMTP [15], etc.) number data units sequentially to detect losses. Unfortunately, these transport-level sequence numbers do not permit receivers to flexibly tailor their reliability semantics. Achieving receiver-driven reliability is cumbersome in the existing "layered" architecture of the network protocol stack where the receiving application has no knowledge of how application-level objects map onto transport level sequence numbers. In this paper, we propose a new data naming scheme that exposes the structure of application data to the transport layer, thereby enhancing the expressibility of an applications' reliability and ordering semantics. We apply this data naming scheme to a reliable multicast protocol framework to achieve receiver-tailored reliability that enhances its scalability. To demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme, we have designed and implemented our scalable naming and announcement protocol (SNAP) in the multimedia application toolkit MASH [17] as a reusable protocol module.

Reference-contexts: In this model, the network delivers a packet from a source to an arbitrary number of receivers by forwarding a copy of that packet along each link of a distribution tree rooted at the source subnet (or, depending on the routing protocol, at a rendezvous point [5] or core router <ref> [1] </ref>). Senders simply send their packets to a "group address" and receivers express their interest in receiving these packets by joining the corresponding multicast group through a group membership protocol.

Reference-contexts: By allowing a receiver to selectively repair portions of the data stream, we can effectively account for an application's semantics in the design of its network protocol. This approach to protocol design, which derives from the Application Level Framing (ALF) protocol architecture <ref> [2] </ref>, is a boon to protocol performance because the application is optimized for the network and vice versa. <p> We implemented SNAP as a library of classes in the toolkit. SNAP runs at user-level in the same address space as the application. Since the application and protocol share an address space, upcalls <ref> [2] </ref> by the transport protocol to query the application are implemented as function calls. The namemap that implements the mapping from names to transport level identifiers is a separate module as shown in Figure 9. The software the mapping from structured names used by the application to transport level identifiers.

Reference-contexts: Most of the existing work focuses on algorithms that ignore application interests. While the independence of transport-level reliability and congestion control algorithms from the application have obvious value, augmenting these with a naming scheme that enables receiver-reliability enhances the scaling properties of the protocol. A recent Internet draft <ref> [3] </ref> on RMFP proposes a two-layered data stream with embedded objects and sequence offsets within objects. This work is orthogonal and complementary to our scalable session announcement protocol.

Reference-contexts: This introduces extra message types and restricts applications to use ASCII string names. Separating the namemap module from the core SRM names-pace mechanisms provides the application with the flexibility to use any naming convention of choice. Other work on a reliable multicast framework (RMF) <ref> [4] </ref> proposes universal receivers, a concept that allows several protocols to be defined using a set of common packet formats.
