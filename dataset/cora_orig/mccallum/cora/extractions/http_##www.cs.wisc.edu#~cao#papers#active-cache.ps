Abstract: Dynamic documents constitute an increasing percentage of contents on the Web, and caching dynamic documents becomes an increasingly important issue that affects the scalability of the Web. In this paper, we propose the Active Cache scheme to support caching of dynamic contents at Web proxies. The scheme allows servers to supply cache applets to be attached with documents, and requires proxies to invoke cache applets upon cache hits to furnish the necessary processing without contacting the server. We describe the protocol, interface and security mechanisms of the Active Cache scheme, and illustrate its use via several examples. Through prototype implementation and performance measurements, we show that Active Cache is a feasible scheme that can result in significant network bandwidth savings at the expense of moderate CPU costs.

Reference-contexts: Compared with servalets, cache applets run at proxy sites as guests and face many resource constraints. There are many studies on Web proxy caching. However, few have addressed the caching of dynamic contents. Robinovich et al have proposed macro-encoded HTML documents that are expanded at the browser site <ref> [1] </ref>. The work is similar to ours in the sense that both try to move the work away from the server. Indeed, a cache applet can easily implement the processing for macro-encoded documents.

Reference-contexts: The evolution of Java as a mature language for mobile code makes the scheme possible. Cache applets are similar to regular browser applets and servlets <ref> [4] </ref>. Compared with regular browser applets, cache applets have a simple, uniform security interface, which greatly simplifies the security problem. Compared with servalets, cache applets run at proxy sites as guests and face many resource constraints. There are many studies on Web proxy caching.
