Abstract: lation uniform mass bleed boundary condition for the slot bleed is successfully employed. For zero angle of attack and critical operation, the pressure distribution agrees well with the experiment. The location and intensity of the terminal shock, total pressure recovery are accurately computed. The angle of attack to cause the inlet unstart is accurately predicted. The mesh refinement results are presented.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, using CFD to accurately simulate the HSCT inlet flow with boundary layer bleed is very challenging. For the NASA VDC inlet which is studied in this paper, Saunders and Keith <ref> [3] </ref> did the first CFD simulation with zero angle of attack by using an axisymmetric Navier-Stokes solver. They used two different types of bleed boundary conditions.

Reference-contexts: They used two different types of bleed boundary conditions. One was to specify the velocity profile across the bleed slot region <ref> [4] </ref>, the other was to use constant pressure across the bleed region and adjust the bleed mass flowrate to the required one incorporated in PARC code [5]. They indicated significant difficulties in computing the critical flow.

They obtained the critical flow with either the back pressure reduced by about 18% from the experimental value or the cowl translated by 3%. They mainly attributed the computational difficulties to the bleed boundary conditions they used.

They mainly attributed the computational difficulties to the bleed boundary conditions they used. Slater et al. <ref> [6] </ref> used the boundary conditions similar to the constant pressure boundary condition of the PARC code and computed the same inlet at zero angle of attack. The shock location was significantly displaced from the experimental position when the experimental back pressure of the critical flow was imposed. <p> Mayer and Paynter [7, 8] used an Euler solver and simulated the inlet operability due to the variation of free stream variables such as temperature, velocity and pressure. Slater et al. <ref> [9, 6] </ref> simulated the unstart/restart due to the freestream disturbance with moving geometry. Neaves and McRae [10] used the dynamic solution-adaptive grid algorithm of Benson and McRae and simulated the 2D and 3D inlet unstart due to the freestream and compressor face perturbations. <p> These studies made contributions from different aspects to investigate the high speed inlet operability with boundary layer bleed. However, most of the above results did not have experiments to be compared with and are not quantitative. Some comparison with experiment was given in <ref> [6] </ref>. But the shock location and profile were largely deviated from the experiment at the critical operation under the experimental back pressure. It therefore still limited their results at the qualitative level. These studies were all at zero angle of attack.

Reference-contexts: Hence, for some of the cases, the computation benefited from the axisymmetry of the flow field to save CPU time. For the numerical studies on high speed inlet operability due to the angle of attack with boundary layer bleed, no work has been reported. Vadyak et al. <ref> [13] </ref> made the first computation of the flow field of a mixed compression inlet with angle of attack using the method of characteristics with shock fitting. Due to their numerical solver limitation, they did not take into account the wall boundary layer and boundary layer bleed.

Reference-contexts: Due to their numerical solver limitation, they did not take into account the wall boundary layer and boundary layer bleed. They were thus not able to predict the inlet unstart due to the angle of attack. Howlett and Hunter <ref> [14] </ref> computed a 3D external compression inlet with angle of attack. The un-start was not a problem in their work and there was no boundary layer bleed in that inlet.

Reference-contexts: Accurate simulation of HSCT inlet operability due to angle of attack is very important to achieve a design of HSCT inlet with high efficiency and wide stability margin <ref> [15] </ref>. 2 The Inlet The inlet studied in this work is the NASA Variable Diameter Centerbody (VDC) inlet designed and tested in Lewis Research Center in 1975 as shown in Fig. 1 [16, 17, 18].

It is a bicone, mixed-compression inlet with design cruise Mach num ber 2.5. A two-cone spike was used to provide the maximum external compression compatible with high total pressure recovery and relatively low cowl drag. <p> One streamwise sweep per time step and no inner iteration was used. The initial flow field was generated from the uniform freestream flow with the mesh sequencing technique. Fig. 2 is the 3D mesh used for the NASA VDC inlet <ref> [16] </ref> with 201 points in streamwise direction, 31 points in circumferential direction and 81 points in radial direction. The narrow band before the inlet throat with dense mesh in the streamwise direction is the boundary layer bleed region. <p> It also has the detailed experimental results which can be used to assess the accuracy of the computation. Fig. 4 displays the pressure distributions (normalized by the freestream total pressure) compared with the experiment <ref> [16] </ref> at zero angle of attack (ff = 0:0 ffi ) and critical operation. The experimental bleed mass rate of 1.3% is used and the computation is done in the axisymmetric and 3D domains.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 4 indicates that the circumferential mesh point is adequate since the pressure distributions predicted by the axisymmetric and 3D mesh are almost identical. A bi-section root search iteration is used to find the proper back pressure corresponding to the critical operation <ref> [20] </ref>. The computation of the axisymmetric computation is much more efficient than the 3D one. Therefore the second function of the axisymmetric computation is to help the 3D computation search the back pressure corresponding to the critical operation.

Reference-contexts: However, the Roe scheme produced two low speed bulges at about 45 ffi . The low speed bulges seriously block the mass flow and the computation never obtained the started flow for 3D case using the Roe scheme. Harten's entropy fix <ref> [21] </ref> was used and smeared the two bulges. However, there was still strong circumferential gradient and always caused the inlet unstart.

Reference-contexts: We found that the momentum equation was not easily simplified and introduced numer ical instability. In addition, we impose the first order derivative of the tangential velocity to be zero instead of the second order derivative to be zero as in <ref> [22] </ref>. The present bleed boundary con dition was incorporated into the GASP code by the authors. 4 Mesh Refinement Computation Mesh refinement computation is needed to access the accuracy and uncertainty of the computation using the baseline mesh. As mentioned above, the 3D computation is very expensive.
