Reference-contexts: Therefore a polyphase matrix H (z) of polynomial degree (K1) is completely 6 determined by 2 + (M 1)(L 1) parameters where L is the McMillan degree of H (z). Factorization of polynomial matrices unitary on the unit circle is a direct consequence of classical results in network theory <ref> [1, 44] </ref>. Consider the filter h 0 of length N , M (K 1) &lt; N M K. <p> r (1) : : : r (N 2) + r (N + 2) . . . . . . 0 r (M (N 2) + 1) + r (M (N 2) 1) : : : r ((M + 1)(N 2)) + r ((M 1)(N 2)) 7 7 5 v = <ref> [1; 0; : : :; 0] </ref> T is always an eigenvector of Q with eigenvalue 1. If there exists any other eigenvector for Q, then f 0 (t k)g do not give rise to an orthonormal system (and the WTF may not be an ON basis).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years wavelet orthonormal bases have been constructed and studied extensively from both a mathematical and a signal processing point of view <ref> [6, 27, 28, 5, 3, 47, 48, 36] </ref>. One reason that wavelets are interesting is that they overcome some of the shortcomings of short-time Fourier decompositions [30, 17, 48, 7, 20, 13], by decomposing a signal into channels that have the same bandwidth on a logarithmic scale. <p> In order to overcome this problem M -band orthonormal wavelet bases have been constructed recently by several authors [17, 52, 23], as a direct generalization of the 2-band wavelets of Daubechies <ref> [6] </ref>. M -band wavelets help to zoom in onto narrow band high frequency components of a signal, while simultaneously having a logarithmic decomposition of frequency channels. Moreover, they give better energy compaction than 2-band wavelets [52]. <p> a sequence h (n) will be denoted by H (z) and H (!) respectively. 2 An Overview of M -band Wavelet Theory There is a close relationship between FIR perfect reconstruction filter banks and compactly supported wavelet bases in the 2-band case (as well as the general M -band case) <ref> [6] </ref>. M -band wavelets were initially constructed by exploiting this connection [17, 52, 38]. <p> In fact for N &lt; 1 this equation, the scaling recursion, always has solution in L 2 (IR) <ref> [6, 28] </ref>. Moreover, Daubechies and Lagarias [9, 24] prove the existence of a unique solution to the scaling recursion in L 1 (R) T L 2 (R). In any case, the unique solution can be constructed by the following process due to Daubechies [6]. <p> Moreover, Daubechies and Lagarias [9, 24] prove the existence of a unique solution to the scaling recursion in L 1 (R) T L 2 (R). In any case, the unique solution can be constructed by the following process due to Daubechies <ref> [6] </ref>. One starts with any integrable function and applies the operator T 0 to it recursively. This process converges weakly in L 2 (IR) to the scaling function. <p> Moreover, one can also show that the scaling function is compactly supported in h M1 by standard Paley-Wiener arguments <ref> [6] </ref>. Given the scaling function, one defines the wavelets, one for each unitary wavelet filter as follows: i (t) = M k A fundamental property of the M -band wavelets so constructed is that their translates and dilates by powers of M form a tight frame for L 2 (IR). <p> However, using the techniques in <ref> [6] </ref> it is easy to show that if Q (!) is bounded above by an appropriate constant, then the regularity of the scaling function can be estimated.

Reference-contexts: One reason that wavelets are interesting is that they overcome some of the shortcomings of short-time Fourier decompositions <ref> [30, 17, 48, 7, 20, 13] </ref>, by decomposing a signal into channels that have the same bandwidth on a logarithmic scale. Thus high frequency channels have wide bandwidth and low frequency channels have narrow bandwidth. <p> The disadvantage, however is that if there are high frequency signals with relatively narrow bandwidth (like a long RF pulse), the decomposition is not well suited. In order to overcome this problem M -band orthonormal wavelet bases have been constructed recently by several authors <ref> [17, 52, 23] </ref>, as a direct generalization of the 2-band wavelets of Daubechies [6]. M -band wavelets help to zoom in onto narrow band high frequency components of a signal, while simultaneously having a logarithmic decomposition of frequency channels. Moreover, they give better energy compaction than 2-band wavelets [52]. <p> Excellent surveys of this work also appear in [43, 46]. While Daubechies' construction of K-regular scaling filters and associated 2-band wavelet bases did not draw from the theory of unitary filter banks, the M -band wavelet bases constructed in <ref> [17] </ref> are based on deep results in filter bank theory. From the filter bank approach, however, there is no simple scheme to obtain K-regular, M -band scaling filters. In general one has to solve a set of non-linear equations to numerically obtain the filter impulse responses [17]. <p> wavelet bases constructed in <ref> [17] </ref> are based on deep results in filter bank theory. From the filter bank approach, however, there is no simple scheme to obtain K-regular, M -band scaling filters. In general one has to solve a set of non-linear equations to numerically obtain the filter impulse responses [17]. This paper makes three main contributions. Firstly, explicit formulas for K-regular M -band scaling filters are obtained. Just as in the 2-band case Daubechies' construction, the shortest length 1 K-regular M -band scaling filter is fixed modulo a spectral factorization. <p> Secondly, two different approaches to the construction of the (M 1) wavelet filters and associated wavelet bases are described. One of them relies on a state-space characterization of compactly supported wavelet bases with a novel technique for obtaining the unitary wavelet filters; the other uses the factorization approach in <ref> [17] </ref>. The wavelets so constructed in general give rise only to wavelet tight frames (not orthonormal bases). Thirdly, this paper gives a set of necessary and sufficient condition on the M -band scaling filter for it to generate an orthonormal wavelet basis. <p> M -band wavelets were initially constructed by exploiting this connection <ref> [17, 52, 38] </ref>. This section gives a tutorial overview of this connection between perfect reconstruction filter banks and M -band wavelets. 2.1 Perfect Reconstruction Filter Banks The structure of the classical one-dimensional filter bank problem is given in Fig. 1. <p> Using this and Fact 3 all finite length unitary scaling filters can be parametrized <ref> [17, 52] </ref>. One can show that linear constraint (in Eqn. 14) is equivalent to the vector v 0 in Eqn. 13 having all its entries 1= p M . <p> This can be done by a Gram-Schmidt process in 2 ways since we are adding exactly (M 1) orthogonal columns. This is the only process of construction of unitary wavelet filters that has been discussed in the literature <ref> [17, 52] </ref> and is essentially equivalent to [23]. However, this overlooks the crucial fact that there do exist other choices of wavelet filters with the same length N = M K. <p> A proof of this fact in the M -band case may be found in <ref> [17] </ref>. The corresponding proof in the 2-band case is due to Lawton [28]. <p> This method for constructing wavelet filters and wavelets has been suggested in <ref> [17, 52, 23] </ref>. The only restriction on V 0 is that it be orthogonal and that the first row is h p p i . Therefore, two potential choices for V 0 are the Type 2 Discrete-Cosine-Transform (DCT) matrix [35] and the DFT matrix. <p> By spectral factorization we obtain formulas for the scaling filter coefficients themselves. Wavelet bases are characterized using state-spaces techniques and a state-space characterization of wavelet filters associated with any given scaling filter is obtained. Both the state-space approach and the factorization based approach <ref> [17, 52, 23] </ref> may be used to design regular M -band wavelet filters. Wavelet bases constructed from unitary scaling filters are in general tight frames. Necessary and 29 sufficient conditions for an M -band wavelet tight frame to be orthonormal are also given.

This feature of K-regular scaling filters is particularly useful in image processing applications [51]. K-regularity is also useful in numerical analysis applications <ref> [26] </ref>, where one tries to approximate operators in wavelet bases. In these applications the regularity K of the scaling filter is a measure of the approximation order.

The conditions are very similar to those obtained by Cohen [4, 8] and Lawton <ref> [27] </ref> for 2-band wavelets. This distinction between a tight frame and an orthonormal basis is quite subtle (and technical) and has been overlooked in the signal processing community. The organization of the paper is as follows. <p> Moreover W i;0 is equipped with ON basis. For any J one readily sees that W i;J ? W j;J , for i 6= j and hence the result follows. When M = 2, Cohen [5] and Lawton <ref> [27] </ref> have independently obtained characterizations of the scaling filter such that the scaling function and its translates form an orthonormal system. We now extend these results to the M -band case. <p> Of all the characterizations of orthonormality, Eqn. 57 is the easiest to verify. It says that given an unitary scaling filter, the corresponding wavelet basis is ON iff the Law ton matrix (after Lawton who constructed it for the 2-band case <ref> [27] </ref>) defined below has a unique eigenvector of eigenvalue 1.

Reference-contexts: If there exists any other eigenvector for Q, then f 0 (t k)g do not give rise to an orthonormal system (and the WTF may not be an ON basis). There is a well-known sufficient condition for orthonormality in the 2-band case due to Mallat <ref> [29] </ref> which is easy to verify and stated in terms of H 0 (!). This condition can be generalized immediately to the M -band case and we have the following corollary of Theorem 4, a proof of which may be found in [14].

Reference-contexts: The disadvantage, however is that if there are high frequency signals with relatively narrow bandwidth (like a long RF pulse), the decomposition is not well suited. In order to overcome this problem M -band orthonormal wavelet bases have been constructed recently by several authors <ref> [17, 52, 23] </ref>, as a direct generalization of the 2-band wavelets of Daubechies [6]. M -band wavelets help to zoom in onto narrow band high frequency components of a signal, while simultaneously having a logarithmic decomposition of frequency channels. Moreover, they give better energy compaction than 2-band wavelets [52]. <p> M -band wavelets help to zoom in onto narrow band high frequency components of a signal, while simultaneously having a logarithmic decomposition of frequency channels. Moreover, they give better energy compaction than 2-band wavelets <ref> [52] </ref>. Central to Daubechies' discovery of compactly supported 2-band wavelets is the lowpass filter of a two channel unitary filter bank with a specified order of regularity. <p> M -band wavelets were initially constructed by exploiting this connection <ref> [17, 52, 38] </ref>. This section gives a tutorial overview of this connection between perfect reconstruction filter banks and M -band wavelets. 2.1 Perfect Reconstruction Filter Banks The structure of the classical one-dimensional filter bank problem is given in Fig. 1. <p> Using this and Fact 3 all finite length unitary scaling filters can be parametrized <ref> [17, 52] </ref>. One can show that linear constraint (in Eqn. 14) is equivalent to the vector v 0 in Eqn. 13 having all its entries 1= p M . <p> This can be done by a Gram-Schmidt process in 2 ways since we are adding exactly (M 1) orthogonal columns. This is the only process of construction of unitary wavelet filters that has been discussed in the literature <ref> [17, 52] </ref> and is essentially equivalent to [23]. However, this overlooks the crucial fact that there do exist other choices of wavelet filters with the same length N = M K. <p> This method for constructing wavelet filters and wavelets has been suggested in <ref> [17, 52, 23] </ref>. The only restriction on V 0 is that it be orthogonal and that the first row is h p p i . Therefore, two potential choices for V 0 are the Type 2 Discrete-Cosine-Transform (DCT) matrix [35] and the DFT matrix. <p> By spectral factorization we obtain formulas for the scaling filter coefficients themselves. Wavelet bases are characterized using state-spaces techniques and a state-space characterization of wavelet filters associated with any given scaling filter is obtained. Both the state-space approach and the factorization based approach <ref> [17, 52, 23] </ref> may be used to design regular M -band wavelet filters. Wavelet bases constructed from unitary scaling filters are in general tight frames. Necessary and 29 sufficient conditions for an M -band wavelet tight frame to be orthonormal are also given.
