Abstract: It is shown that an infinite Hankel matrix of a finite rank (or a finite Hankel matrix) admits a generalized Vandermonde decomposition H = V T DV , where V is a generalized Vandermonde matrix, and D is a block diagonal matrix. The full structure of this decomposition was first fully discussed by Vandevoorde [9], but the development here is based solely on linear algebra considerations, specifically the use of the Jordan Canonical Form.

Reference-contexts: We remark that this problem differs from that of finding the nearby Han-kel matrix of lower rank by means of the algorithm of Cadzow <ref> [3] </ref> in that the difference matrix H e H may not be rank one, and generally has full rank. Suppose there is a solution to Problem P1.

Reference-contexts: We begin with some preliminaries, then show how the general structure of the decomposition can be derived using the Jordan canonical form, and conclude with a discussion of the finite dimensional case. Regarding infinite Hankel matrices of finite rank, we have the following theorem from Gantmacher <ref> [4, vol. 2, p207] </ref>: Theorem 1. Let H 1 be an infinite Hankel matrix of rank r.

Reference-contexts: This naturally leads one to expect that the generalization of the Vandermonde decomposition H 1 = V T 1 DV 1 will consist of a confluent Vandermonde matrix <ref> [5] </ref> whose rows have the form in (6). That still leaves open the structure arising in D. This we develop in the next section. 2 2 General Vandermonde Decomposition Assume the matrix H 1 of equ. (1) has rank r.
