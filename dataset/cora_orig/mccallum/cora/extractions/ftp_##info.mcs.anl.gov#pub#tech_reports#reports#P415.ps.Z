Abstract: In this paper, we present a new discrete formulation that maintains discrete invariance and is suitable for use on nonorthogonal meshes. This formulation, unlike its predecessors, allows us to easily use adaptive mesh refinement to concentrate grid points where error contributions are large (near vortex centers). In this way we reduce the total number of grid points required to accurately capture vortex configurations and allow the possibility of solving problems previously considered intractable. To solve these large problems, we require the memory capabilities and computational power of state-of-the-art parallel computers. To use these machines, we have developed scalable libraries for adaptive mesh refinement and partitioning on two-dimensional triangular grids. This general-purpose software uses bisection of the longest side to refine triangles in which error contributions are large. These adaptive meshes are both unstructured and dynamic, and we present a new geometric partitioning algorithm that strives to minimize communication cost by ensuring good partition aspect ratios. We present computational results showing the efficiency of these adaptive techniques for a superconductivity application.

Reference-contexts: Geometric information is used in bisection partitioning algorithms such as the orthogonal recursive bisection (ORB) algorithm of <ref> (Berger and Bokhari 1987) </ref>. This algorithm makes an initial cut to divide the grid points in half. Orthogonal cuts are then made recursively in the new subdomains until the grid points are evenly distributed among the processors. Although this algorithm obtains good load balancing, it ignores the communication min-imization problem.

Reference-contexts: In this way, we reduce the total number of grid points required to accurately model the vortex state in high-temperature superconductors. Toward this purpose, we have developed the algo-rithms and software necessary to adaptively refine triangular meshes on parallel computers <ref> (Freitag, Jones, and Plassmann 1994) </ref>. Triangular elements to be refined are determined by a user-defined indicator function (in this case proximity to the vortex core). <p> Triangles that are not adjacent in the dual graph are independent of each other and may be updated in parallel <ref> (see Freitag, Jones, and Plassman 1994) </ref> for a complete description of the parallel algorithm).

Reference-contexts: In previous work, a finite-difference discretization of the free energy functional on a regular, orthogonal mesh was used <ref> (Garner et al. 1992) </ref>. With that approach, a high density of grid points is required to accurately model the vortex core. Such an approach is inefficient because the constant density of grid points means that many superfluous grid points are used away from the vortex centers. <p> Because of the gauge symmetries of the problem, the Hessian is highly singular at the solution, and we include a damping term to improve the convergence of the method as described by <ref> (Garner et al. 1992) </ref> . The computational kernel of this technique is the solution of the damped Newton system-a large, sparse linear system of equations. We do not explicitly invert this system, but use an iterative solver to obtain an approximate (inexact) solution.

Reference-contexts: We do not explicitly invert this system, but use an iterative solver to obtain an approximate (inexact) solution. The BlockSolve package developed at Argonne National Laboratory by Mark Jones and Paul Plassmann <ref> (Jones and Plassmann 1992) </ref> is used for this purpose.

Reference-contexts: As the maximum final angle of the mesh approaches , the interpolation error in the approximate solution increases. Two basic approaches to refinement guarantee mesh quality: regular refinement and bisection <ref> (see Mitchell 1989 for a comprehensive review) </ref>. Regular refinement divides a triangle marked for refinement into four similar triangles by connecting the midpoints of the three sides. Bisection of the longest side, however, divides this triangle by connecting the midside of the longest side to the opposite vertex.

Reference-contexts: For unstructured adaptive meshes, however, the partitioning cannot be predetermined because it changes with each new refinement of the mesh. Several interesting techniques are used to determine the partitioning of an unstructured mesh. Spectral methods <ref> (see Pothen, Simon, and Liou 1990, for example) </ref> have the advantage of global access to information about the graph to find good separators at the cost of eigenvalue/eigenvector computation.

Reference-contexts: Triangular elements to be refined are determined by a user-defined indicator function (in this case proximity to the vortex core). Currently, the software uses triangle bisection to refine elements and employs a modification of Rivara's technique <ref> (Rivara 1984) </ref> to remove nonconforming points in the refined mesh. Though this approach is efficient in its use of mesh points, the resulting discretized problem is both unstructured and dynamic.
