Abstract: Future networks are expected to integrate diverse services. For this purpose, new algorithms and protocols have been proposed for link scheduling, admission control, and routing. The interaction between these three components is crucial to the performance of the network. However, this interaction is difficult to model realistically using available techniques. In this paper, we present an iterative discrete-time approach that yields a realistic model which takes into account this interaction. The model applies to connection-oriented networks with different types of real-time connections. It describes network dynamics in terms of a system of difference equations. These equations can be solved numerically, allowing the investigation of various control schemes for both transient and steady-state performances. Preliminary results indicate that our approach is computationally much cheaper than discrete-event simulation, and yields sufficiently accurate performance measures. We use our model to compare the performance of different routing schemes on the NSFNET backbone topology with a weighted fair-queueing link scheduling discipline and admission control based on bandwidth reservation. We show that a routing scheme that routes connections on paths which are both under-utilized and short (in number of hops) gives the highest network throughput. fl This work is supported in part by ONR and DARPA under contract N00014-91-C-0195 to Honeywell and Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland, and by National Science Foundation Grant No. NCR 89-04590.

Reference-contexts: Given the link scheduling algorithm and knowing the packet generation characteristics of connections, we should then be able to determine, subject to the local QoS constraints, the number of connections from each class that can be accepted (setup) on a link using some packet level analysis (e.g., <ref> [17, 7] </ref>). The result is thus a set of link states satisfying the local QoS constraints, i.e. the link's schedulability region. Note that each link will typically have a different schedulability region because links have different capacities, are used by different sets of classes, etc.

Reference-contexts: Every link is constrained to be only in a state where the QoS requirements of all connections setup on the link are satisfied. We say that this set of states satisfies the "QoS constraints". This set of states is referred to as the schedulability region of the link <ref> [22] </ref>. For a connection setup request on a multi-link route, we divide the requested end-to-end delay equally among the links; each link should thus guarantee the same maximum delay value for the connection. This is called "equal allocation" policy [32, 33]. <p> Another area is to examine admission controls that block some connection setup requests even if their admission is feasible possibly in order to reduce the chance of future blocking of connections of other types. In this case, blocking would occur at more states of the link schedulability region <ref> [37, 22] </ref>. Another area is to investigate policies for dividing the end-to-end QoS requirement among the links of a route other than the equal allocation policy we considered in this paper. These policies would take into account the current link loads as measured in the last routing update period.

Reference-contexts: Traditional approaches to evaluation appear ineffective in closing this gap. In this paper, we present an iterative discrete-time approach that addresses this gap, making use of approximations to instantaneous blocking probabilities. Our approach integrates techniques from several areas, namely: (1) standard queueing theory techniques <ref> [26] </ref>; (2) the link decomposition technique widely used for packet delay analysis in packet-switched data networks [25] as well as for call blocking probability analysis in circuit-switched telephone networks [15]; (3) the dynamic flow technique used for approximating system dynamics and nonlinearity [12]; and (4) the technique of repeated substitutions used <p> Equation (1) can be viewed as a fluid equation where x (t) is the rate of output flow and [1 B (t)] is the rate of input flow. We don't know an expression for B (t). We know that at steady-state, it can be obtained from the Erlang-B formula <ref> [26] </ref>, i.e., B = E ( ; C) where is the offered traffic intensity, C is the maximum number of calls the link can support (i.e. total number of channels), and E ( ( P C ) n =n! We also know that, at steady-state (when _x = 0), x = <p> particular, the probability P () of being in a state = ( 1 ; 2 ; ; jj ) 2 S is equal to P (0) Q jj z k k ! where P (0) = f P Q jj z k k ! g 1 is the normalization constant <ref> [26] </ref>. Then ~ B k (t) = P 2S 1 ( k + 1 62 S)P (). This result can be used in equations (5) to iteratively solve for the z k (t)'s as in equation (3).

Reference-contexts: We assume that the packet generation characteristics of a connection setup on a multi-link route do not change from link to link, i.e. remain the same as the given external characteristics. This assumption is often made to reduce complexity (e.g., <ref> [17, 27] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: For a connection setup request on a multi-link route, we divide the requested end-to-end delay equally among the links; each link should thus guarantee the same maximum delay value for the connection. This is called "equal allocation" policy <ref> [32, 33] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the performance measures it yields are very close to the exact values obtained by simulation. In this paper, we present results comparing the performance of different routing schemes on the NSFNET backbone topology with a weighted Fair-Queueing link scheduling discipline <ref> [34] </ref>. Our 2 results indicate that a routing scheme that selects paths which are both under-utilized and short (in number of hops) for routing new incoming connections gives the highest network throughput.

Reference-contexts: An arrival of a setup request for a class using the link requests some ^ C to occupy for its life time; we assume ^ C's are integers expressed in units of the link capacity. This link model has a simple solution in the multi-rate circuit switching literature <ref> [35] </ref>. 10 In particular, let class k connections require an effective bandwidth of ^ C k . Let Q (i) denote the steady-state probability of being in state i.

In general, we found that the Knapsack approach is much less time-consuming than the multi-dimension approach.

Reference-contexts: This may cause a computational bottleneck. To avoid this, we can restrict the set of routes from which the source node can choose to only shortest (in number of hops) 2 This QoS requirement is also referred to as packet jitter <ref> [11, 36] </ref>. 4 and close to shortest paths. 3 This is acceptable because using a longer path for a connection ties up resources at more intermediate nodes, thereby decreasing network throughput.
