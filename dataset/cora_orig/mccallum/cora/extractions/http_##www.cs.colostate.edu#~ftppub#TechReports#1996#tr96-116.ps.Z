Reference-contexts: These rotator graphs are Cayley Graphs <ref> [ABR90] </ref> except that the generators (different values of ` give the distinct generators) are not closed under inverse operation and hence the graph is a directed graph.

Reference-contexts: The small diameter helps to keep the interprocessor communication delay low while the low degree of nodes is necessary to limit the number of input-output ports to some acceptable value. Many of the works in network topology has dealt with symmetric or undirected graphs <ref> [DT94, AK89, Pra85a, Pra85b] </ref>, while others concentrated on directed graphs [RPK80, II83, ISO85, FLV88, FM88, FL92, Cor92, FMC93]. Most popular interconnection network has been the well known binary n-cubes or hypercubes; they have been used to design various commercial multiprocessor machines and they have been extensively studied. <p> Recently there has been a spurt of research on Cayley graphs, symmetric graphs defined on permutation of distinct symbols. Most important of them are the so-called star graphs <ref> [AK89] </ref> which seem to enjoy most of the desirable properties of the hypercubes at considerably less cost; they accommodate more nodes with less interconnection hardware and less communication delay. Almost all research on Cayley graphs has been centered around undirected graphs [LJD93]. <p> has both an in-degree and an out-degree of n 1 (hence, the number of edges is n!(n 1)), (2) the diameter of R n is given by D (R n ) = n 1, and (3) R n is vertex symmetric for all values of n like other Cayley graphs <ref> [AK89] </ref>. It is also to be noted that the rotator graphs are hierarchical in the sense that R n can be decomposed into n number of R n1 's.

Reference-contexts: This incremental extensibility is a very essential and desirable property in real life applications of a topology in designing computer networks. A few of the symmetric (undirected) network graphs described in the literature <ref> [AL82, FS81, BA84, SS91, SS92, LB94] </ref> are incrementally extensible. There are also incrementally extensible directed network graphs in the literature [II83, RPK80, FLV88, FL92]. Our purpose in the present paper is to propose another new incrementally extensible directed network topology that can be defined for an arbitrary number of nodes.

Most popular interconnection network has been the well known binary n-cubes or hypercubes; they have been used to design various commercial multiprocessor machines and they have been extensively studied. <p> Almost all research on Cayley graphs has been centered around undirected graphs [LJD93]. Only very recently Corbett <ref> [Cor92] </ref> has pointed to a family of directed Cayley graphs, network graphs based on permutation of elements, called the rotator graphs; it is to be noted these rotator graphs are in fact special case ( = D) of the digraphs (D), with order ( + 1) ( D + 2), proposed <p> Graph theoretic terms not defined here can be found in [Har72] and a detailed treatment of the rotator graphs can be found in <ref> [Cor92] </ref>. <p> We denote the nodes as permutations of English alphabets; for example, the identity permutation is denoted by I = (abc:::z) (z is the last symbol in the string, not necessarily the 26th letter). It has been shown in <ref> [Cor92] </ref> that: (1) R n is (n 1) regular in the sense that each node has both an in-degree and an out-degree of n 1 (hence, the number of edges is n!(n 1)), (2) the diameter of R n is given by D (R n ) = n 1, and (3) <p> The graph G is called maximally fault tolerant iff G is strongly (ffi 1)-connected; the fault tolerance is maximal since the graph's connectivity cannot exceed this value. Rotator graphs are shown to be maximally fault tolerant <ref> [Cor92] </ref>; each node in R n has in-degree (out-degree) of n 1 and R n is strongly (n 2)-connected. In the following we show that the super rotator graphs are also maximally fault tolerant in the same sense.

Reference-contexts: Example: Figure 3 shows the type B connections between a R 3 and a R 1 . Vertex Numbering: It is well known <ref> [Knu72] </ref> that all the n! permutations of n distinct symbols can be uniquely numbered from 0 through n! 1. We use this scheme to number the vertices of any rotator graph R n ; we also extend this scheme to number the vertices of a class C k (m).
