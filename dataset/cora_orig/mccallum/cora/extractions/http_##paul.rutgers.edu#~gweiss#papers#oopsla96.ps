Abstract: System requirements often express some of the behavior of a domain model in the form of policies, constraints, invariants, and rules. Although an object-oriented approach helps with the design of this model, the implementation is often cluttered with details necessary to enforce the model's policies and constraints. As a result, the code is more prone to error and is more difficult to maintain since it tends to obscure the models fundamental structure. R++, a rule-based extension to C++, allows developers to express policies and constraints more clearly in the form of path-based rules. Since the rule evaluation mechanism is automatic, R++ rules enable developers to focus on what to do when a rule evaluates to TRUE, rather than on how and when these evaluations should be carried out. It is the absence of this mechanism in the source code, and the use of these rules in an object-oriented implementation that makes the code easier to maintain and makes for a clearer reection of the underlying model.
