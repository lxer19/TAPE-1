Title: The Complexity of G-free Colourability  
Author: Demetrios Achlioptas 
Address: Toronto  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of  
Abstract: The problem of determining if a graph is 2-colourable (i.e., bipartite) has long been known to have a simple polynomial time algorithm. Being 2-colourable is equivalent to having a bipartition of the vertex set where each cell is K 2 -free. We extend this notion to determining if there exists a bipartition where each cell is G-free for some fixed graph G. One might expect that for some graphs other than K 2 ; K 2 there also exist polynomial time algorithms. Rather surprisingly we show that for any graph G on more than two vertices the problem is NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: If we turn to the edge analogue of G-free 2-Colourability, the few results that are known seem to establish a different picture. There, we wish to colour the edges of the input graph so that G does not appear as a monochromatic partial subgraph. In <ref> [Bur76] </ref> it was shown that if G = K 3 , the problem is NP-complete (MONOCHROMATIC TRIANGLE [GJ79]).

Reference-contexts: We prove this rather surprising result by using an approach very different from that used to prove NP-completeness when k = 2 and G is 2-connected. In that proof a reduction of HYPERGRAPH 2-COLORABILITY <ref> [GJ79] </ref>, for a special class of hypergraphs, to G-free 2-Colourability is used by applying 2 the Nesetril-Rodl construction [NR76] to the input hypergraph and G. The result is a graph whose G-free chromatic number is equal to the chromatic number of the hypergraph. <p> To prove theorem 1 we will reduce Distinct NOT-ALL-EQUAL k-SAT (denoted Distinct NAE k-SAT and defined below) to G-free 2-Colourability, where k = jV G j &gt; 2. We prove that Distinct NAE k-SAT is NP-complete by reducing NAE 3SAT <ref> [GJ79] </ref> to it (Appendix B). 4 Definition 3 Distinct NOT-ALL-EQUAL k-SAT INSTANCE: Set U of variables, collection C of clauses over U such that for each clause c 2 C, jcj = k and all the literals in c are distinct. <p> There, we wish to colour the edges of the input graph so that G does not appear as a monochromatic partial subgraph. In [Bur76] it was shown that if G = K 3 , the problem is NP-complete (MONOCHROMATIC TRIANGLE <ref> [GJ79] </ref>). On the other hand, if G is a k-star (a single vertex of degree k adjacent to k vertices of degree one, where k 3) the problem is solvable in polynomial time as proved in [BEL76]. <p> Financial assistance was provided by the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada. A Three or more colours To prove that G-free k-Colourability is NP-complete when k &gt; 2 we reduce CHROMATIC NUMBER <ref> [GJ79] </ref> to it. A G k -gadget is a G-free k-colourable graph with the same properties as a G-gadget in every G-free k-colouring of it. Thus, G-gadgets are merely G 2 -gadgets.

In theorem 2 and lemma 3, in a sense, we reduced the complexity of G-free 2-Colourability for the vertex case to the existence of uniquely G-free 2-colourable graphs.

Reference-contexts: Such colourings have been studied extensively and form one of the oldest and deepest areas of graph theory. In this course of study many generalisations of the colouring concept have been suggested. The following two notions, introduced in <ref> [Har85] </ref>, appear to be useful in expressing such generalisations in a uniform fashion: Let a property on graphs be a subset of the set of all graphs.

The result is a graph whose G-free chromatic number is equal to the chromatic number of the hypergraph. For this, non-trivial, equality to hold along with the hypergraph's special structure, the 2-connectivity of G is essential.
