Abstract: We present a method to speed up walkthroughs of static scenes. It involves the creation of a continuous C 1 radiosity reconstruction for adaptively sampled regions. This representation is a unified solution to handle unrestricted quadtrees and T-vertices, and allows for the generation of multiple different levels-of-detail of the radiosity function, which is represented as texture maps. The method also involves the use of hardware bicubic filtering for the radiosity display. Both techniques allow improvements in performance and memory usage while preserving visual appearance.

Reference-contexts: One can see this is a good approximation inside the region being represented, but it is not at the edges [3] [4] [17]. Our visual system is sensitive to derivative discontinuities [13] and the C 0 bilinear interpolation between any neighboring regions leads to noticeable visual Mach band artifacts <ref> [1] </ref> [15]. According to Bastos [1], a bicubic interpolation scheme can ensure up to C 1 continuity (first derivative) of the reconstructed function. <p> Our visual system is sensitive to derivative discontinuities [13] and the C 0 bilinear interpolation between any neighboring regions leads to noticeable visual Mach band artifacts <ref> [1] </ref> [15]. According to Bastos [1], a bicubic interpolation scheme can ensure up to C 1 continuity (first derivative) of the reconstructed function. <p> The radiosity function is then reconstructed in two separated phases. In the first phase, three (R, G, B) bicubic reconstructed radiosity patches (RRPs) are created for every element in the solution model using the computed radiosity samples <ref> [1] </ref>. Each RRP can then be sampled at arbitrary resolution to generate corresponding radiosity texture maps. These radiosity texture maps are applied to the original polygons of the model so that we can eliminate radiosity mesh geometry artificially created by the adaptive subdivision. <p> As in <ref> [1] </ref>, the bicubic Hermite form was chosen due to its use of derivative information and the relative ease of approximating such quantities for the radiosity samples.

For a detailed description of the radiosity bicubic Hermite reconstruction see [1]. Given a full quadtree data structure representing the radiosity values at the vertices of a regular subdivision of a polygon, we create a bicubic patch per color components (R, G, B) for each leaf in the tree.

Reference-contexts: An obvious disadvantage of this approach is that it introduces error by replacing an accurate radiosity sample with an interpolated value. The second approach triangulates the large element that neighbors the T-vertex so that all the new triangles share the radiosity value at the point of the T-vertex <ref> [2] </ref>. This approach does not introduce error in the computed solution, but it can produce triangles with poor aspect ratios. Restricted quadtrees are generally used to minimize this problem. In a restricted, or balanced, quadtree, two elements or leaves are allowed to differ by at most one level of subdivision.

Reference-contexts: Usually, the radiosity function is reconstructed using bilinear interpolation of neighboring samples. One can see this is a good approximation inside the region being represented, but it is not at the edges <ref> [3] </ref> [4] [17]. Our visual system is sensitive to derivative discontinuities [13] and the C 0 bilinear interpolation between any neighboring regions leads to noticeable visual Mach band artifacts [1] [15]. <p> We achieve such desired resolutions resampling the bicubic radiosity reconstruction at the desired rates. 3.5 Handling T-vertices and Unrestricted Quadtrees Radiosity adaptive subdivision can generate unbalanced quadtrees with nonconforming elements in regions with different mesh densities <ref> [3] </ref> [17]. Figure 2 presents an example where neighboring elements have different levels of subdivision creating T-vertices in the mesh (vertices 9 and 10). T-vertices are undesirable because the interpolated values at those points will be different from the radiosity value actually computed at that same point. <p> We describe three of them applied specifically to the radiosity domain. The first approach substitutes the radiosity value computed at the T-vertex by the interpolated shading value at that point so that there is no longer a magnitude (D 0 ) discontinuity along the edges sharing that vertex <ref> [3] </ref>. An obvious disadvantage of this approach is that it introduces error by replacing an accurate radiosity sample with an interpolated value. The second approach triangulates the large element that neighbors the T-vertex so that all the new triangles share the radiosity value at the point of the T-vertex [2].

Reference-contexts: This can significantly increase rendering performance on current graphics hardware that support advanced texture mapping capabilities. Heckbert <ref> [6] </ref> proposed the use of texture mapping as an alternative to the mesh based radiosity approach in 1990. In his approach the energy arriving at a surface is computed using Monte Carlo ray tracing and stored at texels of radiosity textures (rexes).

Reference-contexts: A Priori Discontinuity Meshing : We assume that the radiosity function is fairly continuous within each polygon, but this is often not the case in realistic scenes. In order to guarantee this property in all cases, we can accurately represent discontinuities using discontinuity meshing algorithms <ref> [7] </ref>. Unfortunately, these algorithms often produce a tremendous increase in the number of polygons in the processed model and this will increase the number of textures for RAT models. However, as the adaptive subdivision will not have to capture discontinuities, the quadtrees will be shallower requiring less texture memory.

Reference-contexts: This suggests the use of bicubic filtering [16] at the final rendering phase. Such a mode is available on current RealityEngine 2 systems. In order to render our textures smoothly, we replaced the default filter with a bicubic (1/3, 1/3) filter as described by Mitchell and Netravali <ref> [8] </ref>. Radiosity textures rendered with bicubic filtering do not show the Mach band artifacts that appear when the same textures are rendered using bilinear interpolation (Figures 6.(d) and (c)). These textures appear smooth even when magnified greatly on screen. <p> These textures appear smooth even when magnified greatly on screen. However, the bicubic filtering is subject to ringing and blurring effects and it is often necessary to trade off one type of distortion for another <ref> [8] </ref>. Figure 6.(d) shows the blurring effect when compared to figures 5.(a) and 5.(d). Because the bicubic filter effectively blurs the image, we lose some of the contrast of the original in exchange for elimination of the Mach artifacts. Bicubic interpolation is slower than bilinear, too.

Reference-contexts: In situations where there are mesh-based artifacts in the lighting solution, they recalculate the solution directly to the texture map itself by applying radiosity sampling at locations corresponding to texels. Radiosity texture maps are rendered using bilinear texture interpolation on a Silicon Graphics RealityEngine. Moller <ref> [9] </ref> describes a method to replace radiosity solutions for NURBS (geometry) models with a single texture map. This allows for multiple different levels-of-detail of the model with the same illumination texture map. He generates his textures from a radiosity mesh. <p> In general, adaptive subdivision generates sparse unbalanced quadtrees. However, when converting a nonfull quadtree into a texture, the nonsampled points in the quadtree have to be evaluated from the surrounding given points leading to a full quadtree. A simple solution is bilinear interpolation <ref> [9] </ref> which produces almost the same results as the Gouraud shading of the mesh associated with the sparse quadtree and does not improve smoothness if resampled at higher rates. In order to reduce Mach banding artifacts, when using linear interpolation, it is necessary to work with densely sampled radiosity solutions.

Reference-contexts: We have obtained some preliminary results with outputing parametric descriptions of RRPs and using these to render directly. One such implementation makes use of deferred shading available on the PixelFlow architecture under development at UNC <ref> [10] </ref>. RRPs are rendered by rasterizing the bicubic coefficients as well as the parametric coordinates. <p> This implies hardware support for a polygonal primitive with an associated function that describes its color value at every point. Such support is available using the deferred shading capability of the PixelFlow architecture <ref> [10] </ref>. We propose to investigate further implementations of rendering directly from the initial reconstruction of the radiosity function using this platform when it becomes available.

Reference-contexts: Uniform adaptive sampling is supported organizing rexes into quadtrees. During rendering, radiosity at any pixel in the final image is approximated using bilinear interpolation. Due to the Monte Carlo ray tracing and the bilinear reconstruction step, Heckbert's approach can generate noisy and discontinuous images. Myszowski and Kunii <ref> [11] </ref> describe a method to replace the most complex radiosity mesh areas with texture maps based on available texture memory and the number of mesh elements that would be eliminated. <p> This approach has several advantages over capturing radiosity textures directly from the frame buffer <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> We would clearly prefer not to introduce severe artifacts during this second reconstruction. A second disadvantage of bilinear interpolation are the same Mach band artifacts that appear when even very dense textures become magnified excessively, as described by Myszowski <ref> [11] </ref>. Since we assume the shading function is smoothly continuous inside each polygon, we want to have that same smoothness when rendering the radiosity texture. This suggests the use of bicubic filtering [16] at the final rendering phase. Such a mode is available on current RealityEngine 2 systems.

Reference-contexts: Using bicubic filtering, therefore, allows us to use smaller textures that require less space and render quickly, while still maintaining the smoothness of the radiosity reconstruction. It is possible to perform by hardware Hermite bicubic interpolation identical to the one used in the first reconstruction phase <ref> [12] </ref>.

We describe three of them applied specifically to the radiosity domain.

Reference-contexts: Our comparisons are perceptually meaningful, i.e., the quantitative difference between two images indicates their disparity as seen by the human visual system. Perceptual image metrics are discussed in detail in <ref> [14] </ref>. A good image metric must take into account characteristics of human perception, such as sensitivity to relative luminances, non-linear response to brightness, and different sensitivity to different spatial frequencies. We use the first model described in [14]. <p> Perceptual image metrics are discussed in detail in <ref> [14] </ref>. A good image metric must take into account characteristics of human perception, such as sensitivity to relative luminances, non-linear response to brightness, and different sensitivity to different spatial frequencies. We use the first model described in [14]. In this image metric, the image is first normalized by the mean luminance. Then, the value of each pixel is replaced by its cube root. Next, the resulting image is transformed to the frequency domain and a contrast sensitivity function (modeling frequency sensitivity) is applied to filter the frequencies. <p> A quantitative comparison of the two reconstructed images when compared to the reference image confirms that the bicubicly reconstructed image is closer in appearance to the optimal solution. Applying the perceptual image metric <ref> [14] </ref> to the reconstructed images and the reference image we get reference bicubic bilinear reference 0.0 65.03 69.67 where numbers increase with perceptual differences in the images. The metric appears to agree with the differences that are visibly apparent.

Reference-contexts: The usual reconstruction technique for rendering textures is bilinear interpolation. This type of interpolation is readily available and fast on current hardware such as RealityEngine 2 , with published fill rates of 320 million pixels per second <ref> [16] </ref>. <p> Since we assume the shading function is smoothly continuous inside each polygon, we want to have that same smoothness when rendering the radiosity texture.

Bicubic interpolation is slower than bilinear, too. Silicon Graphics claims fill rates of 54 million pixels per second <ref> [16] </ref>, and we have observed similar performance in empirical tests with RAT models (figure 3). We can partially compensate for the slower performance by taking advantage of the smoother rendering of textures that comes from bicubic filtering.
