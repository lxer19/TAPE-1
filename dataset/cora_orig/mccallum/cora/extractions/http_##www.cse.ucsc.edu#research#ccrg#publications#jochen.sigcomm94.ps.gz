Title: Distributed, Scalable Routing Based on Link-State Vectors

Abstract: A new family of routing algorithms for the distributed maintenance of routing information in large networks and internets is introduced. This family is called link vector algorithms (LVA), and is based on the selective diffusion of link-state information based on the distributed computation of preferred paths, rather than on the flooding of complete link-state information to all routers. According to LVA, each router maintains a subset of the topology that corresponds to the links used by its neighbor routers in their preferred paths to known destinations. Based on that subset of topology information, the router derives its own preferred paths and communicates the corresponding link-state information to its neighbors. An update message contains a vector of updates; each such update specifies a link and its parameters. LVAs can be used for different types of routing. The correctness of LVA is verified for arbitrary types of routing when correct and deterministic algorithms are used to select preferred paths at each router. LVA is shown to have smaller complexity than link-state and distance-vector algorithms, and to have better average performance than the ideal topology-broadcast algorithm and the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm.

Reference-contexts: All the work in inter-domain and intra-domain routing has proceeded in two main directions: protocols based on distance-vector algorithms (DVA), which we call distance-vector protocols, characterized by BGP [26], IDRP [22], RIP [18], Cisco's IGRP [4], and EIGRP <ref> [1] </ref>; and protocols based on link-state algorithms (LSA), which we call link-state protocols, characterized by the inter-domain policy routing (IDPR) architecture [33], ISO IS-IS [21] and OSPF [28].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the reliable broadcast mechanism used in LSAs to ensure that all routers with a physical path to a source of link-state updates receives the most recent updates within a finite time (e.g., see <ref> [2] </ref>, [14], [10], [19], [24], [29]) is not applicable to an LVA. Furthermore, as argued before, a router using LVA must explicitly state which links it stops using. a fairly compact topology. Figure 2 (a) shows the complete topology.

Reference-contexts: The router uses this topology information to generate its own source graph using one or more local algorithms, which we call path selection algorithms. In the case of shortest-path routing, Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm could be used as a path-selection algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>. A router derives a routing table specifying the successor, successors, or paths to each destination by running a local algorithm on its source graph; of course, this can simply be a sub-algorithm of the path-selection algorithms used. <p> More specifically, a distributed termination-detection mechanism is necessary for a router to ascertain when a given update is valid. Termination-detection mechanisms based on sequence numbers similar to those used in a number of LSAs and the associated protocols <ref> [3] </ref>, [28], [29] or diffusing computations [14] can be used. Section 5. presents an instance of an LVA using sequence numbers. The importance of termination-detection mechanisms for LVA is illustrated in Figure 1. <p> Because of that delay, unless there is a way for routers to determine when an update is stale, a link value of 10 and infinity may circulate among routers a, b, and c forever. The same problem occurs in any LSA, of course <ref> [3] </ref>. 4. Differences With Previous Methods Before proceeding with a detailed description of a specific LVA, it is worth showing how LVA's basic design differs from prior algorithms based on link-state information. <p> Otherwise, if there is no entry, the message is discarded. A shortest-path algorithm (e.g. Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>) is run on this updated topology table to construct a new shortest-path tree. This tree is used to compute the new routing table, using for example a depth-first search in the shortest-path tree.

Correctness for LVA means that, within a finite time after t 0 , all routers obtain link-state information that allow them to compute loop-free paths that adhere to the constraints imposed by the local algorithms they use to compute preferred paths, and to forward packets incrementally. <p> This is precisely the desired result, and there are a number of simple ways to improve LVA-SEN's behavior after a link or router failure, which involve establishing a "hold down" on the updating of a router's source graph <ref> [15] </ref>. 9. Conclusions We have presented a new method for truly distributed routing in computer networks and internets using link-state information.

Reference-contexts: Today's link-state protocols (e.g., OSPF) cope with the scaling problems inherent in any LSA by organizing the network or internet into areas connected by a backbone; however, this imposes additional network configuration problems and, as the results in <ref> [16] </ref> indicate, at least one DVA (DUAL [13]) using areas outperforms OSPF even in relatively small networks. In summary, the routing algorithms used in today's routing protocols have inherent scaling problems.

Reference-contexts: Because of this, the storage and communication requirements of any distance-vector protocol (e.g., BGP and IDRP) grows proportionally to the number of combinations of service types or policies <ref> [23] </ref>; therefore, supporting many types of service together with different types of policies using any distance-vector protocol is inherently complex. Because LSAs replicate topology information at routers, they avoid the long-term looping problems of old distance-vector protocols. <p> Because LVAs exchange routing information that is related to link (and even node) characteristics, rather than path characteristics, this approach reduces the combinatorial explosion incurred with any type of DVA for routing under multiple constraints <ref> [23] </ref>. Aggregation of information can take place in an LVA by adapting the area-based routing techniques proposed for DVAs in the past [12], [25], [27], [35].

Reference-contexts: In all three algorithms, update messages are processed one at a time, in the order in which they arrive. Both LVA-SEN and LSA use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the local shortest-path tree. The results presented are based on simulations for the DOE-ESNET topology <ref> [36] </ref>. The graphs show the results for every single link changing cost from 1.0 to 2.0 (Fig. 4,5), every link failing (Fig. 6, 7) and recovering (Fig. 8, 9), as well as every node failing (Fig. 10, 11) and recovering again (Fig. 12, 13).
