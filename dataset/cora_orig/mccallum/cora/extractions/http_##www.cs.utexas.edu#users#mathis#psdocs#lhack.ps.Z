Abstract: We present a new acknowledgment strategy to improve the performance of TCP sessions that originate or terminate in noisy wireless networks for mobile computers. This acknowledgment strategy allows the TCP source to distinguish between losses due to congestion and losses due to corruption. With this distinction, the source can reduce its sending rate when congestion occurs, and quickly retransmit when corruption occurs. Without this distinction, TCP throughput is shown to suffer significantly over a path with a large bandwidth-delay product. The strategy is also appropriate for dealing with losses due to hand-offs of a mobile computer from one wireless cell to another. Recent advances in hardware and communication technology have made possible the birth of mobile computing. Advances in radio and infrared technology, in combination with powerful portable computers, will provide users with access to a network at all times. This continuous connectivity will allow users to be quickly notified of changing events, and provide them with the necessary resources to respond to these events, even while in transit. In the near future, it is expected that millions of users will carry a portable computer capable of accessing the worldwide Internet [BIV92]. The possibility of mobile computing and its expected popularity has generated a great deal of research, due to its ramifications in networking and distributed data management [IB94] [FZ94] [PB93]. Although much research exists on the effects of mobility on the network layer, little work exists on its effects on transport protocols, such as TCP [Com91]. Due to the arrival of new user-friendly applications for information distribution over the Internet, TCP traffic has increased significantly, and it is reasonable to assume that most mobile computer traffic will be TCP sessions. Thus, we investigate the effects of wireless computing on TCP performance. Wireless media have different properties from those upon which the design of TCP is based. In particular, TCP assumes that network links rarely corrupt messages [Jac88], because the loss of a message is taken as a signal for congestion in the network. Thus, upon a message loss, TCP reduces its sending rate to alleviate congestion. This approach is effective if corruption losses are rare. However, wireless media have higher bit error rates [GP95], causing significant corruption losses. This will cause TCP to needlessly reduce its sending rate, yielding poor performance. In this paper, we present an acknowledgment scheme that allows the transport protocol to distinguish between congestion and corruption losses. This is accomplished by adding a small amount of functionality to the routers of the wireless networks, while leaving all other routers unchanged. We show how to incorporate this scheme into the TCP protocol, and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulation. The paper is organized as follows. The assumptions on the internetwork structure are presented in Section 2. In Section 3, we overview the congestion control and avoidance strategy of TCP and its vulnerability to corruption losses. The new acknowledgment strategy is presented in Section 4, along with how to incorporate it into the existing TCP protocol. The simulation model and results are presented in Section 5. A summary and concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

Reference-contexts: Thus, upon a message loss, TCP reduces its sending rate to alleviate congestion. This approach is effective if corruption losses are rare. However, wireless media have higher bit error rates <ref> [GP95] </ref>, causing significant corruption losses. This will cause TCP to needlessly reduce its sending rate, yielding poor performance. In this paper, we present an acknowledgment scheme that allows the transport protocol to distinguish between congestion and corruption losses. <p> This yields a round-trip time of 200 msec., which is adequate if the destination is in another continent or if a satellite link is being used. Furthermore, the complex coding and decoding in wireless media adds about 100 msec. to the round-trip processing pipeline of messages <ref> [GP95] </ref>. Thus, an overall delay of 200 msec. is reasonable. The length of data and acknowledgment messages are 500 bytes and 40 bytes, respectively. The bottleneck is link (R2, R3), where cross traffic consumes half the bandwidth. <p> However, the wireless media used in mobile computing have different properties from those upon which the design of TCP was based. For example, wireless media are known to have high bit error rates <ref> [GP95] </ref>, leading to significant corruption losses. TCP assumes that the network links are relatively error free, since the loss of a message is treated as a signal for congestion in the network.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we investigate the effects of wireless computing on TCP performance. Wireless media have different properties from those upon which the design of TCP is based. In particular, TCP assumes that network links rarely corrupt messages <ref> [Jac88] </ref>, because the loss of a message is taken as a signal for congestion in the network. Thus, upon a message loss, TCP reduces its sending rate to alleviate congestion. This approach is effective if corruption losses are rare. <p> However, requiring wireless routers to reliably deliver messages is disallowed, due to the overhead of maintaining timers and performing retransmissions. 3 . TCP Congestion Control In this section, we give an overview of the flow control and congestion control mechanisms of TCP <ref> [Jac88] </ref>, and explain its sensitivity to corruption losses. In the next section, we present our acknowledgment scheme as an approach to remedy this problem. TCP is a reliable transport protocol for the delivery of a sequence of messages over an unreliable datagram network.

Reference-contexts: To prevent a loss in throughput, whenever a fast retransmit due to corruption occurs, the window is not decreased. However, since the window continues to grow linearly, it eventually reaches a value large enough to overflow the buffer of the bottleneck router. This is a well-known problem of TCP <ref> [Kes91] </ref>, but solving it is not the topic of this paper. This causes a fast retransmit due to congestion, and the window is reduced by half. Since the router can buffer an entire bandwidth-delay product of the source (20 messages), the window grows to twice its optimum.

Reference-contexts: Simulation Results We next simulate TCP reno with and without our acknowledgment scheme, using the REAL simulator from <ref> [Kes94] </ref>. The scenario is shown in Figure 2, and consists of: a TCP source, TS, its destination, TD, four routers, R1 through R4, and cross traffic sources, C1 through C7. Cross traffic sources have a poisson distribution. All links have a bandwidth of 100 Kbytes/sec.

Reference-contexts: Also, the measured round-trip time of a retransmitted message is not used for the overall estimate of the round-trip time, since it is unknown if the acknowledgment is for the first or second copy of the message sent <ref> [KP91] </ref>. If a message is lost, the source will receive multiple acknowledgments for the sequence number prior to the lost message.

Reference-contexts: However, if the source is mobile and changes location, then its is unknown if the losses are due to congestion or hand-off, so a slow-start must be performed to the current window size. In <ref> [MGS94] </ref>, a modification to TCP is suggested in which a mobile destination notifies its source that it has changed cells.
