Title: Proposal  Interoperable Query Processing among Heterogeneous Databases

Abstract: The proliferation of database systems based on different data models and query languages has created the need for techniques that support interoperability so that information may be shared among the database systems. This dissertation proposal describes a technique to support interoperable query processing when multiple heterogeneous databases are accessed. We will focus on the problem of supporting query transformation transparently, so a user can pose queries locally, without any need of global knowledge about different data models and schema. To support interoperable query transformation, we need to resolve the conflicts (i.e., heterogeneities) between different databases. The conflicts exist because each database has been designed and populated independently of one another, so semantically equivalent concepts may have been defined in many different ways in each model/schema. Furthermore, we also need to consider the different query language utilized by each database to provide interoperability. We propose two kinds of parameterized canonical representations as a means of classifying and resolving heterogeneities. 1 The first canonical form resolves heterogeneity based on the query language. The second canonical form resolves representation heterogeneity based on using two different schema. We initially focus on object and relational schema. The query transformation mechanism can operate on these canonical forms to produce the proper query for a heterogeneous remote database. We will describe an architecture for supporting interoperability and certain functional modules. The first module described is an extractor module (EM) which parses a source query and extracts semantics, corresponding to some primitive expressions in the query which are represented using a canonical form. The second is a heterogeneous mapping module (HTM) which maps among entities in different schema; this module uses mapping rules which reflect global knowledge of the models, schema, and query languages. We use F-logic, a high-level logic representation, to represent the global dictionary knowledge in a canonical form. We will provide some examples of transforming queries from a relational schema to an equivalent object schema. This proposal outlines several topics that need to be studied in order to solve the problems described above. The first area of investigation is the extension of the current canonical representation for source and target (transformed) queries to cover more constructs in the SQL and XSQL query languages. A second area is the extension of the canonical representation for mapping information to cover further solutions for schema conflict, in particular, conflicts among several object schemas. We describe our current prototype implementation which supports the EM and HTM modules for transforming an XSQL query to an SQL query (and vice versa). We expect to extend the functionality of these modules as we progress in our outlined research.

Reference-contexts: While both approaches rely heavily on the semantics of each schema, the unified global schema approach is forced to take the semantics of every underlying schema into account during the resolution of heterogeneity. The techniques presented in <ref> (Miller et al., 1993) </ref> reveal the inherent complexity of the verification task even for multiple relational schema.
