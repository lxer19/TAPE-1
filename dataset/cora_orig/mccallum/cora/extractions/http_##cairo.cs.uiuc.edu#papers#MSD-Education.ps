Abstract: Multimedia Systems Design (MSD)" teaches graduate students principles and practice of large-scale multimedia system design. The biggest challenge to teach students how to design and build multimedia system is the integration aspect because multimedia systems integrate various computer science areas such as audio/video processing, operating system concepts, high-speed network protocols, user interfaces, and others. Our approach is to apply concepts and examples from these areas to construct a significant project, namely a digital distributed VCR system. The course focus is on a large-scale, long-lived software system of a size requiring group effort. We therefore address multimedia systems design, integrated implementation, maintenance, testing, documentation, code readability and group dynamics . The results which we have seen are (1) a large set of useful software which the student carries with them after the course is over; (2) a learning of new concepts in the area of audio/video processing and communications; (3) an understanding of integration importance when designing and building multimedia systems; (4) an appreciation of software design and maintenance, in particular group dynamics and communication; and (5) a greater understanding of advanced CS topics such as programming language design and implementation, user interfaces, compression algorithms, communications protocols, high-speed networks, and operating systems. We show how the student's knowledge, capabilities and understanding of lectured material together with engineering and scientific principles are related to the programming assignments of the VCR project. We also present the course methodology, and eval uate project management, group structure and dynamics. Such a course is essential to Computer Science curriculum because digital audio/video information becomes a permanent part of our computing and communication environment. This course enables a student's transformation from a programmer with a few pieces of abstractions into a functioning computer scientist capable of designing and building future advanced multimedia systems.

Reference-contexts: WWW provided help in asynchronous learning. The students could access lecture material on the web in form of a hypermedia document consisting of text (html), gif files, short audio and video clips, taped during lecture, digitized, edited and posted. (viewed with vosaic <ref> [CTCL95] </ref> software). The html document with text and gif files was available before lectures, digital audio and video were added to the hypermedia document later. The choice of the VCR application had four positive effects: 1.
