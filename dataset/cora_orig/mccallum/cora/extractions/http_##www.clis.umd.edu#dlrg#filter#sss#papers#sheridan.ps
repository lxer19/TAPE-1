Abstract: We present here the realisation of cross-language speech retrieval system which retrieves German speech documents in response to user queries specified as French text. This has been achieved through the integration of two existing modules of the SPIDER information retrieval system, namely the query pseudo-translation module and the speech retrieval module. In the process of integrating these modules for cross-language speech retrieval, we have also made improvements to each in turn. We have progressed our research on aligning comparable corpora, an important resource for training the similarity thesauri used in our query pseudo-translation module, and we have now encorporated an automatic refinement loop into our speech retrieval module, using a probabilistic matching approach that has been proven effective in retrieving error-prone documents. We have also introduced the use of automatic relevance feedback for query expansion and tested this both as a refinement to automatically pseudo-translated queries and as a preprocessing step for speech retrieval. We have evaluated our cross-language speech retrieval system over a collection of 30 hours of German speech, comparing the effectiveness of French queries (cross-language) against performance on equivalent German queries (mono-lingual). It must be stressed that this work represents our first step in the direction of cross-language speech retrieval. Our aim here is to establish a baseline of performance on this task, against which we can then measure the success of our continuing research in this area.

Reference-contexts: This technique has proven to be effective not only in speech retrieval ((Wechsler and Schauble, 1997)) but also in retrieval from error-prone OCR texts ((Mittendorf et al., 1995), <ref> (Ballerini et al., 1996) </ref>). This approach has the substantial advantages of requiring only a relatively simple phoneme recognizer and having a theoretically unrestricted search vocabulary (the words of a language are composed from a closed set of phonemes).

Reference-contexts: Rank Xerox Re search have investigated in depth the use of a bilingual transfer dictionary (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996) and have examined approaches to dealing with the multiplicity of translations which often result. Apart from using a bilingual dictionary <ref> (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996) </ref> tested the usefullness of automatic relevance feedback as a method of refining query translations for cross-language retrieval, with some success. <p> An example pseudo-translation of a French query from our collection is given in Table 1. This example also gives the original German query (from which the French query was manually translated) for comparison. As a new process in our pseudo-translation module, following the research reported in <ref> (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996) </ref> on the use of relevance feedback for the refinement of translated queries, we have also introduced the possibility of an automatic relevance feedback loop in the pseudo-translator module. <p> We simply note here their use in our cross-language speech retrieval system. Apart from the advances in our research on similarity thesauri, we have also introduced for this work the use of an automatic relevance feedback loop during the pseudo-translation process. <ref> (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996) </ref> report that, when used together with dictionary-based query translation, a pre-translation automatic relevance feedback loop helps final retrieval performance (particularly precision), as does a post-translation feedback loop (particularly recall), and both used together are most effective, with short of vague queries benefitting most from the feedback.

Reference-contexts: Speech recognition technology has to be applied for this purpose, for example in word recognition. Several groups have reported experiments with word recognition based speech retrieval. In Cambridge for example, a video mail retrieval system was developed where messages were retrieved based on 35 keywords <ref> (Brown et al., 1994) </ref>. A similar approach is being taken in the Informedia digital library project at CMU, where a large vocabulary system of approximately 64,000 wordforms is being used for indexing news video (Wactlar et al., 1996).

Reference-contexts: Apart from using a bilingual dictionary (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996) tested the usefullness of automatic relevance feedback as a method of refining query translations for cross-language retrieval, with some success. The use of a dictionary was only one approach tested at CRL ((Davis and Dunning, 1995) <ref> (Davis, 1996) </ref>), where the use of parallel corpora was also examined. For example, query terms were located in the source side of a parallel corpus, parallel sentences were then extracted and various methods employed to determine suitable target language terms from within the parallel sentences.

Reference-contexts: This work seems to be still at a relatively early stage of development though. Approaches which rely on trained resources include the use of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by Bell-core and others <ref> (Dumais et al., 1996) </ref>, and the work at ETH ((Sheridan and Ballerini, 1996)) which uses similarity thesauri for query translation. The ETH approach uses multilingual comparable corpora which are aligned, and documents then merged to form surrogate bilingual documents which are indexed and used in the construction of similarity thesauri.

Reference-contexts: In the more recent work at Cambridge, the large vocabulary recognizer has been completely dropped because of the computational expense involved with its use ((Brown et al., 1996)). An alternative approach to overcoming the vocabulary problem is described in <ref> (Glavitsch and Schauble, 1992) </ref>. This approach was centered on the idea of defining a small set of subword units that would be powerful enough for retrieval while also being suitable for recognition.

Reference-contexts: The use of existing linguistic resources is a natural approach to cross-language retrieval. Rank Xerox Re search have investigated in depth the use of a bilingual transfer dictionary <ref> (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996) </ref> and have examined approaches to dealing with the multiplicity of translations which often result. Apart from using a bilingual dictionary (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996) tested the usefullness of automatic relevance feedback as a method of refining query translations for cross-language retrieval, with some success.

Reference-contexts: However, these results were achieved using a well-tuned speech recognition system that was trained on another 5 hours of speech uttered by the same speakers. Very similar work, in terms of the idea of combining word recognition based retrieval with an open vocabulary word-spotter, is published in <ref> (James, 1996) </ref>. Evaluation over a 2.5 hour test collection of English news broadcasts showed similar results. In the more recent work at Cambridge, the large vocabulary recognizer has been completely dropped because of the computational expense involved with its use ((Brown et al., 1996)).

Reference-contexts: This shortcoming has led to the notion of open vocabulary indexing. In <ref> (Jones et al., 1996) </ref>, indexing based on a 20,000 word recognizer was combined with a word spotter that performed searches for out-of-vocabulary words. Such word-spotting searches generally operate on some phonetical representation of the speech signal.

Reference-contexts: Indexing by N-grams has been shown to be effective for speech ((Wechsler and Schauble, 1995)) as well as for many other environments, e.g. Korean text <ref> (Lee and Ahn, 1996) </ref>. Queries, which are textual, were transformed to phonemic transcriptons using the phoneme dictionary described above and then also indexed by phoneme trigram features. Retrieval is based on matching phoneme trigram features in the query and in the audio documents.

Reference-contexts: As research proceeds and as we begin to have opportunities for direct comparison of approaches, the relative merits and weaknesses of each will become clearer. It is worth mentioning too, that apart from the above work on cross-language information retrieval, there has also been work on cross-language information filtering <ref> (Oard, 1996) </ref>. Speech Retrieval The central focus of research on speech retrieval has long been how to automatically identify and index information from a speech signal. Speech recognition technology has to be applied for this purpose, for example in word recognition.

Reference-contexts: A similar approach is being taken in the Informedia digital library project at CMU, where a large vocabulary system of approximately 64,000 wordforms is being used for indexing news video <ref> (Wactlar et al., 1996) </ref>. A major problem inherent in the use of word-based speech retrieval is the fact that the query vocabulary is fairly restricted in size and must be defined in advance.

Reference-contexts: This function is based on an edit distance dist (w i ; s k ) between the phonemic transcriptions of a query word and the phonemic representation in the slot respectively (see <ref> (Wechsler and Schauble, 1995) </ref> for details), on the number of equal characters between the transcriptions (e), and on the length (l) of the query transcription.

Reference-contexts: It turned out however, that training and tuning the recognition system for this approach would involve substantial manual effort. The results published are therefore based on simulated experiments ((Glavitsch et al., 1994)). The most recent approach to speech indexing developed at ETH includes the open vocabulary idea <ref> (Wechsler and Schauble, 1997) </ref>. Indexing is based on phonemic transcriptions determined by a phoneme rec-ognizer. The phonemic transcriptions are indexed using overlapping N-gram features. At retrieval time, an additional probabilistic matching technique may be applied, during which individual words are matched fuzzily against the erroneous transcriptions.

Reference-contexts: Speech Retrieval Module The speech retrieval module used for this work is based on a speaker-independent phoneme recognizer for German speech which we have constructed using the HTK toolkit <ref> (Young et al., 1993) </ref>. This recognition system was trained on 3:44 hours of the PhonDat speech corpus (PhonDat, 1993). We have trained acoustic models for 32 different phonemes using a state-of-the-art modeling approach: we trained mono-phoneme continuous Hidden Markov Models with 11 mixtures.
