Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of an investigation into single axioms for groups, both ordinary and Abelian, with each of following six sets of operations: fproduct, inverseg, fdivisiong, fdouble division, identityg, fdouble division, inverseg, fdivision, identityg, and fdivision, inverseg. In all but two of the twelve corresponding theories, we present either the first single axioms known to us or single axioms shorter than those previously known to us. The automated theorem-proving program Otter was used extensively to construct sets of candidate axioms and to search for and find proofs that given candidate axioms are in fact single axioms.

Reference-contexts: For example, each of the equalities (x=((((x=x)=y)=z)=(((x=x)=x)=z))) = y, (1.1) is a single axiom for (ordinary) groups. Equation (1.1), in terms of division, ff=fi = ff fi 1 , was shown to be a single axiom by G. Higman and B. H. Neumann in <ref> [1] </ref>, and (1.2) was given by Neumann in [13]. <p> The type and reference are given for each.

No simpler axiom is possible, because three variables are required. We examined identities of the same type and found the following four additional single axioms: (x=((x=y)=(z=y))) = z, (3.8) ((x=((x=y)=z))=y) = z, Groups in terms of division and identity. No single axioms were previously known to us.

Reference-contexts: fi is the variable, we say that a single axiom ff = fi has type hL; N; Di, if L is the number of variable and operator occurrences in ff, N is the number of variable occurrences in ff, and D is the number of distinct variables in ff. (Kunen <ref> [6] </ref> classifies axioms by just hN; Di. The Otter [8] automated theorem-proving program was used extensively in two distinct ways (Section 4) during the investigation: (1) as a symbolic calculator, to construct sets of candidate axioms, and (2) to search for proofs that given candidates are single axioms. <p> Theorem-proving programs have been used in the past to verify known single axioms for groups [3] and to search for and find new single axioms for nonequality theories of groups [10, 12]. Kunen's goal, in his recent study of single axioms for groups <ref> [6] </ref>, was to find precisely how small a single axiom for (ordinary) groups, in terms of product and inverse, can be. By giving non-group models of all candidates, he showed that no single axiom of type hx; 5; 3i exists. <p> We then tried, without success, to find axioms of type h16; 7; 3i, by taking instances of the 107 axioms. All other attempts at finding simpler axioms failed. Kunen <ref> [6] </ref> later showed that the only possibility for a simpler axiom is h16; 7; 3i. Abelian groups in terms of product and inverse. Neumann's axiom (2.4) has type h28; 11; 5i. <p> This approach led to three single axioms, excluding mirror images, of type h10; 5; 3i: (((x y) z) (x z) 1 ) = y, (3.7) (x (((x y) 1 z) y)) = z.

Higman and Neumann's axiom (1.1) has type h17; 9; 3i. <p> Are there single axioms for these cases with just three variables? With our type criteria, there is currently no simplest-known single axiom for groups in terms of product and inverse; the ones given here have type h16; 7; 4i, and Kunen's <ref> [6] </ref> have type h18; 7; 3i. The only possibility for a simpler single axiom is h16; 7; 3i, because a 10 single axiom must have an odd number 3 of occurrences of inverse, at least seven variable occurrences, and at least three variables [6]. <p> have type h16; 7; 4i, and Kunen's <ref> [6] </ref> have type h18; 7; 3i. The only possibility for a simpler single axiom is h16; 7; 3i, because a 10 single axiom must have an odd number 3 of occurrences of inverse, at least seven variable occurrences, and at least three variables [6]. The goal of the work reported here was to find simple single axioms. We made occasional use of Finder [15] to search for small counterexamples when we had a promising candidate that Otter could not prove to be a single axiom. <p> However, further work in this area will most likely benefit from extensive model searches, for both simple models with a program like Finder, and for more complex models as in Kunen's methods <ref> [6] </ref>.
