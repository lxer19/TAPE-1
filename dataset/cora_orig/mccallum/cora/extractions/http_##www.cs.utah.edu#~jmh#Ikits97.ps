Abstract: This work deals with closed-loop calibration methods where the robot endpoint is constrained to lie on a plane. Previously published calibration approaches are shown to have certain weaknesses. A new solution is given using DH and Hayati notations and standard nonlinear least squares optimization. The procedure is extended via the Implicit Loop Method, which takes input noise into account. Pose selection is guided by the Noise Amplification Index. Simulation and experimental results are presented for a PUMA 560 industrial manipulator, and are compared to those obtained from an open-loop calibration procedure.

Reference-contexts: Three important issues have to be considered in these methods. Like in every closed-loop calibration not having a priori knowledge about the task constraint the scale of the mechanism must be set, i.e., one link length has to be known <ref> [1] </ref>. Special care has to be taken about the location of the base and end link frames, which add to the number of identifiable parameters. Finally, we should not ignore the effect of errors in the joint angle measurements.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents closed-loop methods which use only one endpoint constraint, i.e., the number of calibration equations per pose is one <ref> [6] </ref>. Using a probe, the robot touches a number of points on a fixed selected plane, and from the formulated identification model the real robot parameters can be estimated applying an optimization technique. Three important issues have to be considered in these methods. <p> It has been shown that this so-called input noise may cause bias in the parameter estimates [9]. Since the end effector is constrained, the input noise is not negligible compared to the output noise. Thus a total least squares optimization procedure is recommended to avoid unreliable estimates <ref> [6] </ref>. We begin by reviewing previous calibration proposals.

We show the definition for the first case using DH parameters.

Reference-contexts: This equation is the basis for the iterative update of parameters. 3.2.2 Implicit Loop Method The Implicit Loop Method is based on the unification of open and closed-loop methods: the closure of kinematic loops by end-effector measurements or by constraints are considered equivalent <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> Substituting the converged values, the 2 function can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution with expected value of P C and standard deviation of = 2P C, where C is the number of calibration equations per pose. The complete formulation of the Implicit Loop Method can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. 4 Simulation Results In the simulations we generated joint angle readings by solving the inverse kinematics of the Puma robot from endpoints on a given plane. The endpoints were selected according to grid or random distributions and Gaussian noise was added with given variances in directions x,y and z. <p> These discrepancies can also be explained from a different viewpoint. It has been shown in <ref> [12] </ref> that considering the singular value decomposition of the augmented Jaco-bian ^ D = U V T , the columns of V are independent er ror directions having standard deviations ^ i = 1= p i + 1.

Closed-loop methods have employed a ball bar with known length [2] and a plane constraint <ref> [10, 13] </ref>. <p> The situation is similar in the three dimensional case; the calibration plane wanders. 2.2 Using Plane Normals This approach is based on the calculation of the vector products of a set of difference vectors in the same plane, which are supposed to yield plane normals <ref> [13] </ref>. Three points determine a plane, and yield two independent difference vectors from which the plane normal can be extracted. From the cross products of these small plane normals a linear indentification equation system can be derived.
