Abstract: In real-life data mining experiments, the extraction of important patterns may require many trials and errors, and the execution of long sequences of data mining operations. Such a process can be time-consuming, laborious, and conducive to errors. To overcome this problem, we have developed a metalanguage, called KGL ( K nowledge G eneration L anguage), in which a data analyst can plan data mining and knowledge discovery experiments. The language incorporates a wide range of operators that act upon a database, a knowledge base, or a combined data and knowledge base. The latter operators, called knowledge generation operators invoke various programs for machine learning, symbolic inference, and statistical analysis. These operators are available to the KGL data-mining plan through INLEN, a multistrategy system for data mining, knowledge discovery and decision making. The language supports control strategies determined by the data and/or knowledge, rather than by the programmer. The KGL methodology is illustrated by problems of detecting demographic patterns in a world database. The experimental results show a significant potential of the proposed approach to multistrategy data mining.

Reference-contexts: Finally, future research should consider inclusion of operators that are capable of determining patterns in sequential data and temporal databases. Some research on this topic has been done under the topic of qualitative prediction <ref> (Chen, 1986) </ref>. There has also been work on automatically improving representation space for temporal processes prediction through the invention of additional attributes (see work on temporal constructive induction by Davis, 1981).

In conclusion, the greatest advantages of the INLEN methodology enhanced with KGL are the integration of diverse learning and knowledge processing operators, and the ability to design complex experiments for searching for solutions to practical tasks.
