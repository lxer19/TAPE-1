Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for statistical real-time communication in ATM networks. Our goal is to provide delay-guaranteed transport of Variable-Bit-Rate (VBR) video traffic with a statistically-guaranteed cell-loss ratio. In order to provide delay-guaranteed communication service, we employ a modified version of Traffic-Controlled Rate-Monotonic Priority Scheduling (TCRM) [1]. We multiplex a set of statistical real-time channels that share similar traffic characteristics into a common channel called a macro-channel. The statistical real-time channels multiplexed together share the resources of the macro-channel, and individual statistical real-time channels are given timeliness and probabilistic cell-loss guarantees. A macro-channel is serviced by the modified TCRM. It improves link utilization and makes channel management simpler. We propose a procedure for determining the transmission capacity of a macro-channel needed to statistically guarantee a cell-loss ratio bound. It involves the analysis of an M=D=1=N queueing system. In order to avoid the complexity of calculating cell-loss ratios in an M=D=1=N queueing system, we can instead use the analysis of an M=M=1=N queueing system which gives a slightly higher (thus more pessimistic) cell-loss estimate. Simulation results have shown our framework to work well compared to the other approaches. The overall cell-loss ratios for multi-hop statistical real-time channels are shown to be smaller than the pre-determined bounds.

Reference-contexts: Several packet multiplexing techniques have been proposed to provide different QoS for different real-time applications [1-9]. In particular, we proposed Traffic-Controlled Rate-Monotonic Priority Scheduling (TCRM) as a cell-multiplexing scheme for realizing deterministic real-time communication in ATM networks <ref> [1] </ref>. The main attraction of TCRM lies in its simplicity, thus making it suitable for high-speed networks such as ATM and providing good efficiency in terms of channel admissibility under practical circumstances. Real-time communication can be classified into two categories according to QoS requirements: deterministic and statistical [10]. <p> Although their work is theoretically attractive, it is not clear whether it can be applied to real life systems since their scheme assumes an infinite buffer at each node. Moreover, the implementation complexity of PGPS must be resolved for use in high-speed networks like ATM <ref> [1] </ref>. Effective bandwidth has been investigated in order to provide statistically-guaranteed QoS in ATM networks [19-21]. This approach is based on the large deviation theory and often employs an on-off process as a source traffic model. <p> In this paper, we propose a framework to provide statistical real-time communication services for 2 VBR videos in ATM networks based on TCRM <ref> [1] </ref>. TCRM was originally developed for providing deterministic real-time communication services and does not allow statistical multiplexing among real-time connections. We make a slight modification to TCRM so that it may allow statistical multiplexing among a set of real-time connections. <p> The MPEG sequence is IBBPBBPBBPBB IBB.... Since I frames appear once every 12 frames, the frequency of large frames in the histogram is very low compared to that of small frames. 2.2 TCRM TCRM <ref> [1] </ref> is a cell-scheduling scheme for output-queueing ATM switches [43] in order to provide a guaranteed throughput to individual deterministic real-time channels sharing a common outgoing link. 6 It emulates circuit switching during a period longer than the cell inter-arrival time of each real-time channel. <p> So, we have to use the non-preemptive rate-monotonic priority scheduling policy as the cell scheduler. The non-preemptive rate monotonic priority scheduler assigns priority to each real-time channel according to its required throughput, and an in-progress cell transmission will not be preempted. With an appropriate channel-admission control <ref> [1] </ref>, the scheduler provides the minimum throughput i to real-time channel i. Since the cell inter-arrival time is larger than, or equal to, L= i and one cell is permitted to be transmitted every L= i , at most one cell can stay in the scheduler at any time. <p> Since it employs rate-monotonic priority scheduling, TCRM is simple enough to operate in high-speed networks like ATM networks compared to other packet scheduling schemes which require timestamp-based sorting [2, 5, 8, 9] (see <ref> [1] </ref> for detailed implementation issues), while providing network utilization close to that of a deadline-based scheduling which is known to be optimal in terms of network utilization [1]. However, the deterministic real-time communication service provided by TCRM has two disadvantages due to its strict separation among real-time channels. <p> to operate in high-speed networks like ATM networks compared to other packet scheduling schemes which require timestamp-based sorting [2, 5, 8, 9] (see <ref> [1] </ref> for detailed implementation issues), while providing network utilization close to that of a deadline-based scheduling which is known to be optimal in terms of network utilization [1]. However, the deterministic real-time communication service provided by TCRM has two disadvantages due to its strict separation among real-time channels. The first is its inefficient use of link bandwidth and buffer when only the resource usage by real-time traffic is considered. <p> The cell-drain rate from the buffer is ensured to be using the cell logical arrival times. Since the admission control in <ref> [1] </ref> requires only as a parameter, the change of the buffer size does not require any other modifications in the structure 9 of TCRM. Within a macro-channel, we do not differentiate statistical real-time channels from one another. <p> This is illustrated in Figure 5. Although there can be multiple queueing systems when multiple macro-channels run through a link, we specify only a single macro-channel since different macro-channels are virtually isolated from one another, due to the main characteristic of TCRM, the Firewall property <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Although the macro-channel's utilization is about 0.5, it does not necessarily mean the waste of bandwidth since the unused bandwidth by the macro-channel can be used for transmission of best-effort traffic by TCRM, as in the case of real-time channels <ref> [1] </ref>. 22 23 Finally, we investigated the effects of buffer size on the cell-loss ratio. We set the buffer size to 500 cells. The cell-loss ratios obtained from the simulation are much smaller than the bound as seen in the steady-state quickly is violated in a large-buffer system. <p> The framework is based on TCRM <ref> [1] </ref>, which was originally proposed for deterministic real-time communication in high-speed networks like ATM.

Reference-contexts: They specified channel-establishment conditions for statistical performance guarantees. However, since it requires the calculation of the probability of deadline overflows that depends on other channels' activities, their channel-establishment process is quite complex. Kurose <ref> [11] </ref> proposed to model a traffic source with a family of random variables that bound the number of packets sent during various time intervals. In his approach, the delay suffered by each packet in the network can be upper bounded, but the bound may be quite loose.

Reference-contexts: In his approach, the delay suffered by each packet in the network can be upper bounded, but the bound may be quite loose. Zhang et al. applied Kurose's input traffic model to Rate-Controlled Static-Priority (RCSP) and provided statistical performance guarantees for individual real-time connections in general packet-switched networks <ref> [12] </ref>. They proposed to use traffic shaping at the intermediate nodes in order to prevent the burstiness of VBR traffic as packets travel through the network. However, each packet is required to carry its timing information for traffic shaping.

Reference-contexts: Effective bandwidth has been investigated in order to provide statistically-guaranteed QoS in ATM networks [19-21]. This approach is based on the large deviation theory and often employs an on-off process as a source traffic model. In particular, Elwalid et al. <ref> [21] </ref> derived the worst-cast traffic parameters for achieving lossless multiplexing and used them in order to extract multiplexing gains from the statistical independence of traffic processes subject to the constraint of a small buffer-overflow probability. They employed the leaky-bucket-regulated periodic on-off process as their input traffic model to this end. <p> In Figure 8, we also show the Chernoff bound estimate of the cell-loss ratio which is calculated using the derived periodic on-off random process suggested by Elwalid et al. <ref> [21] </ref> and the approximation by a Gaussian distribution which is based on Central Limit Theorem (CLT) [19]. Both approaches employed the buffer-overflow probability as a QoS parameter while ours uses the cell-loss ratio. <p> The on and off periods derived from the parameters are 2,444 frame intervals and 11,395 frame intervals, respectively. By substituting these parameters into the Chernoff bound estimate according to the step suggested in <ref> [21] </ref>, we obtained the result plotted in Figure 8. In addition to the Chernoff bound, we also show the more accurate refined Chernoff bound by Bahadur and Rao [50]. <p> percentile, we used the average cell-generation rate of I frames as a peak rate in order to favor Elwalid et al.'s approach, but it is not justifiable in a strict sense since the original peak cell-generation rate is required in order to obtain the parameters for a lossless multiplexing system <ref> [21] </ref>. In Figure 9, we show the simulation result on link 1 only since each link has a different trunk capacity depending on the characteristics of the aggregate traffic. However, we obtained similar results on the other links.

Reference-contexts: By using this model, they were able to use the Chernoff bound as a buffer-overflow probability estimate. Although their approach is mathematically elegant, the estimate based on the extremal on-off process is quite pessimistic as will be seen in Section 4. Chou and Shin <ref> [22] </ref> considered statistical real-time communication in multiaccess networks. In general, statistical real-time communication in multi-hop point-to-point networks is more difficult to implement than in multiaccess networks since the interference among traffic coming from neighboring nodes/links must be considered.

Reference-contexts: This TCRM guarantees the timely delivery of every cell as long as it is not lost due to buffer overrun. Thus, cell losses due to buffer overrun must be probabilistically bounded for realizing statistical real-time guarantees. By employing the histogram-based model <ref> [23] </ref> as the input traffic specification for video traffic data along with the modified TCRM, we analytically derive a statistical bound for the average cell-loss ratio of each statistical real-time channel. Simulation results are shown to support our analysis. <p> Accurate characterization of these compressed data streams is essential for real-time transport of such data over ATM networks. By appropriately modeling the traffic, it is possible to dimension network resources while satisfying the QoS requirements. Many models were previously proposed for VBR video under various compression schemes <ref> [23, 26-40] </ref>. Since the VBR behavior of a video stream strongly depends on the compression technique used, many of these models do not characterize MPEG-coded video which is currently widely-accepted as a standard for transmission and storage of video data in many multimedia systems. <p> These synthetic streams are then used for a simulation study of bandwidth-allocation and buffer-dimensioning problems. Compared to the analytic approach considered in this paper, their approach doesn't scale well (i.e., has a limitation in dealing with a large number of multiplexed video streams).

Although the bit rate changes rapidly as a new frame starts in MPEG video unlike the motion JPEG video considered in <ref> [23, 41] </ref>, the change of bit rate can still be considered slow compared to a cell's worst-case link delay in ATM networks if the ratio of buffer size to the output rate is sufficiently small.

Reference-contexts: Compared to the analytic approach considered in this paper, their approach doesn't scale well (i.e., has a limitation in dealing with a large number of multiplexed video streams). Skelly et al. [23] also proposed the histogram-based model in order to describe a VBR video traffic, and Shroff and Schwartz <ref> [41] </ref> presented an analytic solution to the bandwidth-allocation problem for 1 The original sequence was generated by Garrett and Vetterli [25]. 4 multiplexed video streams under the assumption that each stream was deterministically smoothed at the source. <p> The traffic-generation rate is sampled once every T seconds and the sampled rate is considered to be the generation rate during that period. Although the bit rate changes rapidly as a new frame starts in MPEG video unlike the motion JPEG video considered in <ref> [23, 41] </ref>, the change of bit rate can still be considered slow compared to a cell's worst-case link delay in ATM networks if the ratio of buffer size to the output rate is sufficiently small. <p> Therefore, using the M=M=1=N analysis for deriving a cell-loss ratio bound doesn't result in link bandwidth over-reservation. We can reduce the degree of over-reservation; in fact, the analysis result of an M=M=1=N system can be made arbitrarily close to that of an M=D=1=N system by increasing N <ref> [41] </ref>. In Figure 8, we also show the Chernoff bound estimate of the cell-loss ratio which is calculated using the derived periodic on-off random process suggested by Elwalid et al. [21] and the approximation by a Gaussian distribution which is based on Central Limit Theorem (CLT) [19].

Reference-contexts: When a large number of video streams are multiplexed, the assumption of using random smoothing at the source can be relaxed since a large number of similar and independent sources can be considered as a Poisson process <ref> [42] </ref>. <p> This is also the case in an M=M=1 system analysis. In the M=M=1 system, the packet inter-arrival and service times are correlated. To handle this difficulty, Kleinrock proposed to use "Independence Approximation" in analyzing a communication network using a general queueing network like the Jackson network <ref> [42, 48] </ref>. It asserts that, in an M=M=1 system, merging several cell streams on a transmission link has an effect akin to restoring the independence of inter-arrival times and service times.

Reference-contexts: The MPEG sequence is IBBPBBPBBPBB IBB.... Since I frames appear once every 12 frames, the frequency of large frames in the histogram is very low compared to that of small frames. 2.2 TCRM TCRM [1] is a cell-scheduling scheme for output-queueing ATM switches <ref> [43] </ref> in order to provide a guaranteed throughput to individual deterministic real-time channels sharing a common outgoing link. 6 It emulates circuit switching during a period longer than the cell inter-arrival time of each real-time channel.

Reference-contexts: If the minimum cell-drain rate at the scheduler is i , there will never be an unbounded accumulation of cells at the scheduler. The minimum cell inter-arrival time and the cell-delay bound at the scheduler will be given by L= i . Liu and Layland <ref> [44] </ref> proved that the rate-monotonic priority scheduling is optimal among all fixed-priority scheduling policies when the deadline of each task is the same as the task period. <p> Thus, we adopt the rate-monotonic priority scheduler for cell transmissions. This scheduling policy assigns higher priority to real-time channels with higher request rates, i.e., higher i . Note that the analysis in <ref> [44] </ref> is based on a preemptive scheduling policy. However, preemptive scheduling is not desirable for cell transmissions, since if in-progress transmission of a cell is interrupted, the cell will be lost and has to be retransmitted, thus wasting network resources.

Reference-contexts: For the time being, let's assume that the histogram defined at the source node remains unchanged at all intermediate nodes. In general, the output process of an M=D=1=N queue is not a Poisson process and cell inter-departure times are correlated <ref> [47] </ref>. This poses difficulty in analyzing a multi-hop statistical real-time channel. This is also the case in an M=M=1 system analysis. In the M=M=1 system, the packet inter-arrival and service times are correlated.

Reference-contexts: By substituting these parameters into the Chernoff bound estimate according to the step suggested in [21], we obtained the result plotted in Figure 8. In addition to the Chernoff bound, we also show the more accurate refined Chernoff bound by Bahadur and Rao <ref> [50] </ref>. Compared to our analysis results based on the M=M=1=N and the M=D=1=N systems, both the Chernoff bound and the refined Chernoff bound estimates are too pessimistic. Considering the fact that Elwalid's approach is based on the extremal traffic description, one can anticipate the pessimistic result in Figure 8.
