Abstract: In many practical direction-of-arrival (DOA) problems the number of sources and their directions from an antenna array do not remain stationary. Hence a practical DOA algorithm must be able to track changes with a minimal number of snapshots. In this paper we describe DOA algorithms, based on a new decomposition, that are not expensive to compute or difficult to update. The algorithms are compared with algorithms based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). fl This report is available by anonymous ftp from thales.cs.umd.edu in the directory pub/reports. y Advanced Digital Systems, United Technologies Research Center, E.

Reference-contexts: The smallest singular value of R is approximately equal to k , 3. kF k 2 + kGk 2 ~ = 2 p . Since this decomposition makes the rank of X evident on inspection, it is called a rank revealing URV decomposition <ref> [1] </ref>. In practice the choice of k will depend on the size of F and G. For now we will consider F and G small if = kF k 2 + kGk 2 tol; (2:1) where tol is a user supplied tolerance. <p> These updating algorithms require O (p 2 ) time. They can be implemented on a linear array of p processors in such a way that they require only O (p) time. See <ref> [1] </ref> for details. 4. An Adaptive Tolerance In practice the small singular values of X will come from noise, and the user must furnish a tolerance to distinguish them from the singular values associated with the signal. The simple model described in [1] seems to provide an effective tolerance. <p> See <ref> [1] </ref> for details. 4. An Adaptive Tolerance In practice the small singular values of X will come from noise, and the user must furnish a tolerance to distinguish them from the singular values associated with the signal. The simple model described in [1] seems to provide an effective tolerance. Suppose that X has the form X = ^ X + E, where ^ X has rank exactly k.

Reference-contexts: Since new is less than or equal to the prescribed tolerance, the new URVD satisfies - tol, and the approximate rank does not increase. However, it is possible for the rank to decrease. Hence the rank is checked, using a condition estimator <ref> [2] </ref>. If it has decreased, then R is deflated by computing its rank-revealing URV decomposition. The second case occurs when new &gt; tol and consequently the rank may have increased.

Reference-contexts: If the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reasonable, this should not result in an underestimation of the rank. 5. Updating The DOA The algorithms we will use to update the DOAs are the minimum-norm (min-norm) method <ref> [3] </ref> and root-MUSIC. The polynomial rooting form of MUSIC and min-norm will be used only to evaluate the statistical performance of the algorithms and not as a fast algorithm. Note that finding the roots of a polynomial will destroy any advantage gained by using the URVD.

Reference-contexts: The narrowband signals with known angular frequency ! impinge on the array from directions, 1 , 2 , : : : , M . The reader is referred to <ref> [4] </ref> for additional details on the signal model and signal covariance matrix. We may obtain the estimate of the orthogonal subspace required for DOA estimation from the covariance matrix or from the data matrix.
