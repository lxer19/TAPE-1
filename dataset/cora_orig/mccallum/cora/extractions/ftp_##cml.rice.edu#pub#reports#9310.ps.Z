Abstract: It is shown that its convergence speed is not affected by the presence of anisotropy provided that the corresponding coarse grid correction is damped sufficiently strong. Our analysis is based on properties of wavelet packets which are supplied and proved. Numerical approximations to the speed of convergence illustrate the theoretical results.

The lower bound does not depend on m because the m 's are uniformly bounded smaller than 1, see (3.8). The function f is monotonically decreasing in x.

The iteration matrix of the basic iterative method (BIM) (also called smoothing iteration <ref> [10] </ref>) with respect to A l;m will be denoted by S l;m = I W l;m A l;m : (3.3) The matrix W l;m characterizes the special BIM, for instance the choice W l;m = fi 1 diag (A l;m ), fi 2 R, gives the damped Jacobi iteration. <p> (-1 ; -2 ) = -2 t t 1 fi m (g t h t )fI M l1;2m+1 (-1 ; -2 )g A 1 -1 with M L e ;m (-1 ; -2 ) = 0. 8 Proof: The recursion (3.6) follows by transfering the proof of Lemma 7.1.4 in <ref> [10] </ref> to our situation. 3.2 Robustness of the damped V -cycle For our considerations we will need the Euclidean (spectral) norm kwk = hw; wi 1=2 as well as the energy-norms relative to the A l;m 's, kwk l;m = hw; wi 1=2 := h A l;m w; wi 1=2 . <p> matrix W l;m in (3.3) satisfies W t l : (3.9) The notation A B signifies that A and B are symmetric matrices and that B A is positive semi definite. 9 Remark: The (sufficiently) damped Jacobi iteration as well as the symmet- ric Gau-Seidel iteration fulfill (3.9), see e.g. <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Proof: We follow the proof of Lemma 6.4.6 in <ref> [10] </ref>. The statement of Lemma B.1 (appendix) implies e Q l;m C A ffi 2 l A l;m and (3.9) can be rewritten as I C W ffi l W l;m which gives A l;m C W ffi 2 l X l;m . <p> Proof: The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 7.2.1 in <ref> [10] </ref>. Since c M l;m = b S -=2 b S l;m + fi m -=2 P 1 i b S l;m and since c M l1;2m+i 0, i = 0; 1, (3.10) proves c M l;m 0. <p> Moreover, in the extreme case * = 0 where no damping is needed the proofs in Chapter 7.2 of <ref> [10] </ref> can be transfered to the FDMGM without any modifications and yield the contraction number kM L;0 (-1 ; -2 )k L;0 p p : Appendix A Uniform boundedness of the m 's In this appendix the proof of (3.8) will be given.

Reference-contexts: A wavelet variation of the frequency decomposition mutigrid method (FD-MGM) of Hackbusch [11] was presented in <ref> [15] </ref> and the robustness of the corresponding two-level method with respect to any intermediate level was verified. However, due to numerical experiments the V -cycle implementation of the multilevel process seems not to be robust, see Figure 1. <p> A more detailed discussion of the wavelet variation of the FDMGM can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>, see also the original paper [11]. <p> The associated matrix norms are denoted by the same symbols. With %(B) we abbreviate the spectral radius of B which is the largest absolut value of the eigenvalues of B. The following proposition has been proved in <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> Further, an explicit expression of r m given in <ref> [15] </ref> shows that the assumption r m (*; ffi l ) = 0 is reasonable if * t ffi 2 l . <p> We have the following recursion formula 2m (!) = 4 jH (!=2)j 2 m (!=2) + jH (!=2 + )j 2 m (!=2 + ) ; (A.4) see <ref> [15] </ref>. With these definitions we are able to express the numbers m from Proposition 3.2 by m = sup R m (!) (A.6) where R m (!) = jH (!=2)j 2 jH (!=2 + )j 2 ( m (!=2) m (!=2 + )) 2 , see also [15]. <p> ; (A.4) see <ref> [15] </ref>. With these definitions we are able to express the numbers m from Proposition 3.2 by m = sup R m (!) (A.6) where R m (!) = jH (!=2)j 2 jH (!=2 + )j 2 ( m (!=2) m (!=2 + )) 2 , see also [15]. In the lemma below the bracket expression [] denotes the `greatest inte ger' and ld denotes the logarithm with respect to the basis 2. Lemma A.1 The inclusion 0 &lt; min (!) 4 (!) max (!) &lt; 1 (A.7) holds true for all m 1. <p> Lemma A.1 The inclusion 0 &lt; min (!) 4 (!) max (!) &lt; 1 (A.7) holds true for all m 1. Proof: Both inner inequalities follow inductively from (A.4), (A.5) and (A.2). The leftmost inequality was shown in Lemma 2.3 (iv) in <ref> [15] </ref>. Lemma A.2 The supremum of the m 's (A.6) is bounded smaller than 1, sup f m j m 2 N 0 g &lt; 1 : Proof: We assume that supf m j m 1g = 1. <p> Lemma B.2 We have that kU t (U A l;m U t ) 1 U A l;m k C ; where the constant C does not depend on *, ffi l or m. Proof: The proof will be very technical and we will use results proved in <ref> [15] </ref>. The matrix U A l;m U t has the following block structure U A l;m U t = A l1;2m B ! with B = * c m;c m;c l g t . <p> For m = 0, E 1 equals E 2 . Due to part (ii) of Lemma 2.3 in <ref> [15] </ref> 0 (2! fl ) is equal to zero if and only if ! fl 2 f0; ; 2g. For ! fl 2 f0; 2g, the limit lim !!! fl 0 (!)= 0 (2!) exists. <p> In the case ! fl = , the function H (!) has a zero al least of order 3 (N 3), see [6] or [7]. However, the zero of 0 (2!) in ! fl = is only 18 of order 2, Lemma 2.1 (i) in <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> The cases j = 1 and j = 0 with m 1 yield E 4 max ! 1 (!)= min ! 1 (!). It remains to consider j = 0 and m = 0. However, this was already done in Lemma 2.4 of <ref> [15] </ref>. Altogether we have shown that jfl c fl 2m+j;2;2 for j = 0; 1. <p> Proof of Lemma B.1: We will need the estimate k (I U t U )A 1 l;m k C 0 ffi 2 which can be verified by a simple modification of the proof of Lemma 5.3 in <ref> [15] </ref>. The constant C 0 does not depend on *, ffi l or m. Now, kA 1 l;m k l;m k C A ffi 2 with C A = (1 + C)C 0 where the constant C is as in Lemma B.2.
