Abstract: The rigidity of a matrix measures the number of entries that must be changed in order to reduce its rank below a certain value. The known lower bounds on the rigidity of explicit matrices are very weak. It is known that stronger lower bounds would have implications to complexity theory. We consider restricted variants of the rigidity problem over the complex numbers. Using spectral methods, we derive lower bounds on these variants. Two applications of such restricted variants are given. First, we show that our lower bound on a variant of rigidity implies lower bounds on size-depth tradeoffs for arithmetic circuits with bounded coefficients computing linear transformations. These bounds generalize a result of Nisan and Wigderson. The second application is conditional; we show that it would suffice to prove lower bounds on certain restricted forms of rigidity to conclude several separation results such as separating the analogs of PH and PSPACE in communication complexity theory. Our results complement and strengthen a result of Razborov. We introduce a complexity measure, called AC 0 -dimension, of families of boolean functions. While high rigidity implies large AC 0 -dimension, large AC 0 -dimension for explicit families would already give explicit languages outside the analog of PH in communication complexity. Moreover, the concept of AC 0 -dimension allows us to formulate interesting combinatorial problems which may be easier than rigidity and which would still have consequences to separation questions in communication complexity.

Reference-contexts: A good candidate for high rigidity over R seems to be an Hadamard matrix. However, the best known lower bound for such a matrix is only (n 2 =r 2 ) due to Alon <ref> [A] </ref>. In view of this poor state of affairs, it seems natural to consider restricted versions of rigidity and their applications to computational complexity. Such an approach was first taken by Krause and Waack [KW]. <p> At the same time, our techniques are general enough to yield a number of known results. These include an alternate proof of Alon's <ref> [A] </ref> lower bound of (n 2 =r 2 ) on the rigidity of an Hadamard matrix. We also obtain a generalization of a lower bound due to Krause and Waack [KW] on "variation rank" as a corollary to one of our results. <p> The rest of the proof follows from Corollary 2.7 and a counting argument identical to Alon's <ref> [A] </ref>. We include it for completeness. Suppose there are fewer than n 2 =(r + 1) 2 changes in H. Then, there is an (r + 1) fi n submatrix in which there are fewer than n=(r + 1) changes.

Reference-contexts: First, we observe that Toda's theorem ("PP is as hard as the Polynomial-time Hierarchy") continues to hold in the communication complexity world as well. This can be proved by essentially translating Toda's proof [To] (cf. <ref> [BF] </ref>). Theorem 5.1 (Toda's theorem in communication complexity) PH cc P (PP) cc . One can also naturally consider the notion of interactive proof systems in the communication complexity model.

Reference-contexts: Such questions are relevant to communication complexity. We prove the conditional result that it would suffice to prove lower bounds on such weaker forms to separate the communication complexity analogs of PH and PSPACE along standing open question in communication complexity <ref> [BFS] </ref>. This result strengthens a result of Razborov [R]. Finally, when changes to the entries of an Hadamard matrix are bounded in absolute value by a constant, we get asymptotically optimal lower bounds, (n (n r)), on the number of changes needed to reduce its rank below r. <p> We next turn our attention to Boolean complexity.

In this section, we relate this question to weak rigidity. We also mention another simple question that relates weak rigidity to separating ACC and is a slight modification of a question described by Pudlak and Rodl [PR]. <p> We also mention another simple question that relates weak rigidity to separating ACC and is a slight modification of a question described by Pudlak and Rodl [PR]. Taking a complexity theoretic view of Yao's [Ya1] model of communication complexity, Babai, Frankl, and Simon <ref> [BFS] </ref> defined analogs of various Turing Machine complexity classes. To define communication complexity classes, we consider languages consisting of pairs of strings (x; y) such that jxj = jyj. 10 Denote by 2fl the universe f (x; y) : x; y 2 f0; 1g fl and jxj = jyjg. <p> L A is not necessarily unique (since the n's may be different from powers of two), but for the purposes of lower bounds we will fix one such language and refer to it as the language L A corresponding to A. We recall the following definitions from <ref> [BFS] </ref>: Definition 5 Let the nonnegative integers l 1 (m); : : : ; l k (m) satisfy the inequality l (m) := P k (log m) c for a fixed constant c 0. <p> However, Lautemann's theorem that BP P 2 " 2 holds in the communication complexity model, as observed in <ref> [BFS] </ref>. Now replacing the randomized moves of Alice and Bob in an interactive protocol using Lautemann's result, we get a sequence of 9 and 8 moves followed by a refereeing protocol. From the definition of PSPACE cc (Definitions 5 and 6), we then conclude that IP cc PSPACE cc .

Reference-contexts: Proving lower bounds on the rigidity, and related functions, of "explicit" matrices is a fundamental question with applications in algebraic circuit complexity [V, P, PRS, SS], communication networks [P], branching programs <ref> [BRS] </ref>, threshold circuits [KW], and communication complexity [R].

We remark that Borodin, Razborov, and Smolensky <ref> [BRS] </ref> proved a lower bound of (n * = log n) over a broader class of fields for the Generalized Fourier Transform Matrix. They applied it to derive lower bounds on a restricted model of branching programs.

Reference-contexts: The best known lower bounds are ( n 2 r log n r ) over finite fields due to Friedman [F] and (n 2 =r) over finite and infinite fields for various classes of matrices by Pudlak [P] (see also <ref> [PV, KS] </ref>) and Razborov [R]. A good candidate for high rigidity over R seems to be an Hadamard matrix. However, the best known lower bound for such a matrix is only (n 2 =r 2 ) due to Alon [A].

A good candidate for high rigidity over R seems to be an Hadamard matrix. However, the best known lower bound for such a matrix is only (n 2 =r 2 ) due to Alon [A]. <p> Such questions are relevant to communication complexity. We prove the conditional result that it would suffice to prove lower bounds on such weaker forms to separate the communication complexity analogs of PH and PSPACE along standing open question in communication complexity [BFS]. This result strengthens a result of Razborov <ref> [R] </ref>. Finally, when changes to the entries of an Hadamard matrix are bounded in absolute value by a constant, we get asymptotically optimal lower bounds, (n (n r)), on the number of changes needed to reduce its rank below r. <p> In this model, the characteristic function of a language L A on pairs of m-bit strings can be thought of as a 2 m fi 2 m boolean matrix A n (with 0-1 or 1 entries), where n := 2 m . Razborov <ref> [R] </ref> proves that good lower bounds on rigidity over a finite field imply strong separation results in communication complexity: For an explicit infinite sequence of (0,1)-matrices fA n g and a finite field F, if R F A (r) n 2 =2 (log r) o (1) , then there is an <p> At present, no explicit languages are known to be outside cc 2 . We remark that lower bounds in this communication complexity model imply lower bounds in Boolean circuit complexity. An example involving ACC will be mentioned in Section 4. We complement and strengthen the results of Razborov <ref> [R] </ref> by relating variants of the rigidity problem over R to separation questions in communication complexity.

Reference-contexts: We note some structural results in communication complexity. The model by interactive proof systems in communication complexity can be defined in a natural way analogous to the corresponding notion in the Turing machine model. We consider this model and observe that the well-known result <ref> [LFKN, Sha] </ref> IP = PSPACE holds in the communication complexity world as well. Other simple observations include the validity of Toda's theorem ("PP is at least as as hard as PH") in communication complexity and the containment of NC in PSPACE cc . <p> By adapting the techniques of <ref> [LFKN, Sha] </ref> (cf. [She]), it is easy to prove that PSPACE cc IP cc . <p> From the definition of PSPACE cc (Definitions 5 and 6), we then conclude that IP cc PSPACE cc . Therefore, we have the following analog of a well-known result <ref> [LFKN, Sha] </ref> in Turing machine complexity: Theorem 5.2 (IP = PSPACE in communication complexity) IP cc = PSPACE cc . In Section 6, we will refer to bounded round interactive proof systems in communication complexity.

Reference-contexts: First, we observe that Toda's theorem ("PP is as hard as the Polynomial-time Hierarchy") continues to hold in the communication complexity world as well.
