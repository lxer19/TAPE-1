Reference-contexts: The above attack requires Q to initiate an outbound authentication when it is waiting for the inbound authentication from P to complete. Another attack scenario, suggested by Martn Abadi <ref> [1] </ref>, does not require this.

Reference-contexts: From our experience, these protocols tend to be more resistant to attacks than their simplified variants, and are easier to be proved correct. Our Principle of Full Information can also be viewed as a concrete implementation of Principle 1 in <ref> [2] </ref>. Specifically, full information specifies that each message should carry as much information as possible regarding the current authentication run, to the extent that it becomes self-contained and uniquely identifiable as belonging to a particular authentication run.

Reference-contexts: This is because messages communicated in one run could be exploited by a saboteur to compromise the run in the other direction. (See <ref> [3] </ref> for an example.) The situation may improve, however, if the one-way protocol is full information. We illustrate this using f . <p> However, even for these protocols, the principle of full information should still be observed implicitly. For example, in <ref> [3] </ref>, a low level authentication protocol is developed in which the names of participating principals are encoded implicitly using the exclusive-or operation. 11 Notions similar to that of a full information protocol have also been used in other context.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The purpose of this note is to describe a useful lesson we learned on authentication protocol design. In a recent article <ref> [9] </ref>, we presented a simple authentication protocol to illustrate the concept of a trusted server. The protocol has a flaw, which was brought to our attention by Martn Abadi of DEC. <p> We believe the Principle of Full Information is a useful authentication protocol design principle, and advocate its use. Lastly, we present several heuristics for simplifying full information protocols and illustrate their application to a mutual authentication protocol. 2 A Problematic Protocol The following protocol appears in <ref> [9, pp. 42-43] </ref>. 1 It performs only one-way authentication, authenticating a principal P to another principal Q. We call P and Q respectively the initiator and responder of the protocol. fl Research supported in part by NSA INFOSEC University Research Program under contract no. <p> MDA 904-91-C7046 and MDA 904-93-C4089, and in part by National Science Foundation grant no.

Postscript files of this and other papers of the Networking Research Laboratory are available from http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lam/NRL. 1 The protocol specification in <ref> [9, pp. 42-43] </ref> is more verbose. We have omitted some obvious internal steps here. 1 In what follows, fmg k denotes the encryption of m by k while "," denotes the concatenation operator.

Reference-contexts: A verifies both encryption (i.e., "proof of consent" from both parties) before it would carry out the key translation. While is shown to be incorrect in Section 2, f can be formally shown to be correct <ref> [11] </ref>. (The precise notion of correctness adopted is discussed in Appendix A.) 4 The Making of f was then simplified as described in the following because we thought that the simplified protocols would be clearer and more efficient.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, a saboteur Z can obtain encrypted messages of 2 These two protocols represent respectively the well-known push and pull models <ref> [12] </ref>. 4 the form fZ; X; mg k XA for any principal X and any message m of its choice. 3 This is because a key translation request can be made by any principal independent of the knowledge or consent of the other principal.
