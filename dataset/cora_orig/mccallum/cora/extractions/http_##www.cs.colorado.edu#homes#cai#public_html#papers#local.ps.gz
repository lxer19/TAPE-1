Title: Local Multiplicative Schwarz Algorithms for Convection-Diffusion Equations  
Author: Xiao-Chuan Cai and Marcus Sarkis 
Address: Boulder, CO 80309  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Colorado  
Abstract: We develop a new class of overlapping Schwarz type algorithms for solving scalar convection-diffusion equations discretized by finite element or finite difference methods. The precon-ditioners consist of two components, namely, the usual two-level additive Schwarz precon-ditioner and the sum of some quadratic terms constructed by using products of ordered neighboring subdomain preconditioners. The ordering of the subdomain preconditioners is determined by considering the direction of the flow. We prove that the algorithms are optimal in the sense that the convergence rates are independent of the mesh size, as well as the number of subdomains. We show by numerical examples that the new algorithms are less sensitive to the direction of the flow than either the classical multiplicative Schwarz algorithms, and converge faster than the additive Schwarz algorithms. Thus, the new algorithms are more suitable for fluid flow applications than the classical additive or multiplicative Schwarz algorithms.

However, to obtain the optimal coloring and ordering is difficult in practice especially when the underlying mesh is unstructured and the subdomains are obtained by means of graph partitioning, see, e.g., <ref> [3, 10] </ref>.
