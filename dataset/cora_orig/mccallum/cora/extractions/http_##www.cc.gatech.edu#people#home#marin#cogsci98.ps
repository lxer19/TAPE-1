Abstract: This paper identifies goal handling processes that begin to account for the kind of processes involved in invention. We identify new goal properties and mechanisms for processing goals, as well as means of integrating opportunism, deliberation, and social interaction into goal/plan processes. We focus on enterprise goals, which extend traditional design goals and knowledge goals to address significant enterprises associated with an inventor. Enterprise goals represent seed goals of an expert, around which the whole knowledge of an expert gets reorganized and grows more or less opportunistically. Enterprise goals reflect the idiosyncrasy of thematic goals among experts. They constantly increase the sensitivity of individuals for particular events that might contribute to their satisfaction. Our exploration is based on a well-documented example: the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell. We propose mechanisms to explain: (1) how Bell's early thematic goals gave rise to the new goals to invent the multiple telegraph and the telephone, and (2) how the new goals interacted opportunistically. Finally we describe our implemented computational model, ALEC (Analogical Learning by Explaining Creatively), that accounts for the role of enterprise goals in invention.

Reference-contexts: ALEC integrates and extends some of the previous models of invention and scientific discovery, such as Bradshaw and Lienert (1991), Kulkarni and Simon (1988), and Bhatta and Goel (1993). In particular, ALEC's enterprise goal assessment attempts a functional decomposition of an enterprise goal in subgoals <ref> (suggested also by Bradshaw & Lienert, 1991) </ref> to assess if at least some of these functional subgoals can be implemented easily, providing a basis for opportunistic design synthesis.

Reference-contexts: To facilitate the generation of design solutions, given their intended function, the LTM contains a collection of CASES, ARTIFACTS, MODELS, indexed by their function. To facilitate internal evaluation of the CURRENT SOLUTION proposed by the Enterprise Processing, the LTM contains EVALUATION KNOWLEDGE <ref> (e.g., Forbus, 1984) </ref> used by the Evaluation & Repair. To facilitate a further analysis of the invention process, LTM contains a NOTEBOOK, which provides a derivational record of the invention.

Reference-contexts: Introduction This paper investigates the enterprises of invention. We focus on enterprise goals in design, which address those enterprises of an inventor resulting in the creation of novel and interesting artifacts. Enterprise goals extend design goals <ref> (e.g., Goel et al., 1997) </ref> and knowledge goals (e.g., Ram & Hunter, 1992) with new properties, providing one way to explain how creative and innovative ideas are generated, evaluated and further pursued by expert reasoners, such as inventors. <p> Enterprise goals are open goals, outside the operational knowledge of a reasoner, which are interesting for him, and for which the reasoner has some competence to approach them. Enterprise goals borrow from design goals <ref> (e.g., Goel et al., 1997) </ref> and knowledge goals (e.g., Ram and Hunter, 1992), but they: (1) fulfill explicit thematic goals of a reasoner, (2) have a long-term significance and activity assessed explicitly (enterprise assessment), (3) rely explicitly on opportunistic cross-fertilization processing (even partial results may help satisfy overall thematic goals indirectly), <p> In Figure 2 we have represented two enterprises, Enterprise 1 and Enterprise 2, which evolve in parallel. A functional specification of an enterprise accounts for an initial given state, which is transformed by the device function in a final makes state <ref> (Goel et al. 1997) </ref>. Each enterprise specification contains a makes state (e.g., M1 for Enterprise 1), a given state (e.g., G1 for Enterprise 1), and possibly, constraints restricting the (behavioral) paths between the given and makes states (e.g., C1 for Enterprise 2).
