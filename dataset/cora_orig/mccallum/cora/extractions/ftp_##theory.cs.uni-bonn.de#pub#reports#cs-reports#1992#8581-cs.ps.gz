Abstract: In contrast to deterministic or nondeterministic computation, it is a fundamental open problem in randomized computation how to separate different randomized time classes (at this point we do not even know how to separate linear randomized time from O(n log n ) randomized time) or how to compare them relative to corresponding deterministic time classes. In another words we are far from understanding the power of random coin tosses in the computation, and the possible ways of simulating them deterministically. In this paper we study the relative power of linear and polynomial randomized time compared with exponential deterministic time. Surprisingly, we are able to construct an oracle A such that exponential time (with or without the oracle A) is simulated by linear time Las Vegas algorithms using the oracle A. For Las Vegas polynomial time (ZPP) this will mean the following equalities of the time classes:

Reference-contexts: Most researchers believe that the power of ZPP does not (or not by much) exceed P . BPP is included in P 2 and thus in the polynomial hierarchy. On the other hand, under some oracle, BPP 6 P 2 <ref> [St 85] </ref>. We will show that under appropriate oracles ZPP=EXPTIME and BPP = 2 EXPTIME. This means: under some oracle the zero-error PTMs are exponentially more powerful that their deterministic counterparts, and bounded error PTMs are exponentially more powerful than nondeterministic machines.
