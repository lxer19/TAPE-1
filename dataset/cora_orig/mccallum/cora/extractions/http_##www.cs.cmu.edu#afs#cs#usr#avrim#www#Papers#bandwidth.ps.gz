Title: Semi-Definite Relaxations for Minimum Bandwidth and other Vertex-Ordering problems  
Author: Avrim Blum Goran Konjevod R. Ravi Santosh Vempala 
Abstract: We present simple semi-definite programming relaxations for the NP-hard minimum bandwidth and minimum length linear ordering problems. We then show how these relaxations can be rounded in a natural way (via random projection) to obtain new approximation guarantees for both of these vertex-ordering problems.

Reference-contexts: When the (symmetric) non-zero elements of the matrix are viewed as vertex adjacencies in an undirected graph, then the reordering problem is the minimum bandwidth problem for the resulting graph. For a survey on the bandwidth problem and early approaches, see <ref> [1] </ref>. The minimum bandwidth problem was first shown to be NP-hard in 1976 [10], and later even for trees of degree at most three and for caterpillars [5, 9].

Reference-contexts: The exact strength of this lower bound is an open problem, but the largest known gap is O (log n) for an n-vertex graph. One of the known constructions of graphs which achieve this gap, so-called Cantor combs, was described by Chung and Seymour <ref> [2] </ref>. The following lemma says that the integrality gap of our simple relaxation is no larger than the gap between the density lower bound and the optimum. Lemma 10 Let (x; b) be the optimal solution of the bandwidth SDP. Then b = W (B d ). Proof.

Reference-contexts: Here we give some facts that indicate that the gap might be much smaller. One of the known lower bounds for the bandwidth of a graph is called the density lower bound <ref> [3] </ref>. It is defined as B d = max jHj 1 diam (H) ; where the maximum is taken over all connected subgraphs of G. The exact strength of this lower bound is an open problem, but the largest known gap is O (log n) for an n-vertex graph.

Reference-contexts: Using a simple semi-definite relaxation we derive an O ( p b log n) approximation for the minimum bandwidth. A refinement of this relaxation allows us to get an O ((log n) 3=2 ) approximation for the minimum-length linear ordering problem. Recently (and independently) Feige <ref> [4] </ref> introduced the notion of a volume-respecting embedding of an undirected graph, and used it to achieve a polylogarithmic approximation for the bandwidth problem. Interestingly there are many similarities between the two approaches. <p> But this sum is at the same time at most bjHjdiam (H), and so bjHjdiam (H) = W (jHj 2 ): That is, b = W jHj diam (H) 2 6 Conclusions and further work Along the lines of the constraint set (6), and Feige's result <ref> [4] </ref>, it is possible to refine the semi-definite relaxation further (by using the constraints on k-simplices instead of just edges and triangles).

Reference-contexts: Constraint set (5) enforces essentially this condition (see lemma 1 below). Although there are exponentially many constraints in (5), it is not hard to construct a separation oracle for them, and hence the SDP can be solved in polynomial time (see Grotschel, Lovasz, Schrijver <ref> [6] </ref>). To answer the separation problem for (5) for a given node i, simply sort the vertices j 6= i in increasing order of (v i v j ) 2 and check for violation each of the n 1 sets that occur as prefixes in this order.
