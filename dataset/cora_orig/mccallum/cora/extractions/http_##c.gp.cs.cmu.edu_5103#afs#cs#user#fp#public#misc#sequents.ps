Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Sequent calculi were conceived by Gentzen <ref> [Gen35] </ref> primarily as a technical device for proving the consistency of logic and arithmetic. Their central property is cut elimination (Gentzen's Hauptsatz) which usually yields consistency as an easy corollary. <p> We use and to range over formula sequences. We omit `;' at the beginning of a formula sequence, and write ; for the concatenation of and . 2.1 LJ : Gentzen's Sequent Calculus for Intuitionistic Logic A sequent in Gentzen's system LJ <ref> [Gen35] </ref> has the form =) A or =) , that is, the right-hand side of the sequent arrow may consist of one or zero formulas. We write D for an empty or singleton sequence of formulas. <p> We usually overload the sequent arrow =). When necessary we write LJ =) D for derivability in LJ, and LJ =) D for derivability in LJ (cut-free LJ derivations) and similarly for other sequent calculi. Theorem 1 (Cut Elimination for LJ) LJ LJ Proof: See <ref> [Gen35] </ref>. <p> Unfortunately, the gap between natural deduction and sequent calculus has become wider, so our rules are motivated by an extension of the intuitionistic case to multiple conclusions, rather than directly from natural deduction. 3.1 LK: Gentzen's Sequent Calculus for Classical Logic Gentzen's calculus LK for classical logic <ref> [Gen35] </ref> arises from LJ by allowing arbitrary formulas sequences on the right-hand side, rather than just zero or one. This means we now have more structural rules on the right. Initial Sequents. I Cut.

Reference-contexts: In order to alleviate this, there are so-called one-sided formulations of classical linear logic which exploit its inherent symmetries to arrive at a more economical system. Girard in his seminal paper <ref> [Gir87] </ref> presents such a one-sided formulation of linear logic. In it we consider only the following connectives.

Reference-contexts: the system CLV introduced in the next section. 4.2 CLV : A Two-Sided Formulation of Classical Linear Logic with Four Zones In this section we present a formulation of a sequent calculus for linear logic, called CLV very close to Andreoli's dyadic system 2 [And92] and similar to Girard's LU <ref> [Gir93] </ref>. This formulation was specifically devised to allow a simple proof of cut elimination. A sequent has the form ; =) ; fi which may be interpreted as !; =) ; ?fi in ordinary linear sequent calculus.

Reference-contexts: Many other proofs of cut elimination for this and closely related system have been published in the literature. 2 2 INTUITIONISTIC LOGIC 5 2.2 G 3 : A Sequent Calculus for Intuitionistic Logic without Structural Rules Kleene developed the system G 3 <ref> [Kle52] </ref> in order to simplify decidability proofs for propositional fragments, but it can also be motivated as a pure calculus of proof search for natural deduction.

Reference-contexts: If !; =) ; ?fi where formulas in and are not of the form !A and ?A, respectively, then ; CLV Proof: By structural inductions over the derivation in the assumption, using non-linear weakening and contraction from Lemma 5. Some cases may be found in <ref> [Pfe94a] </ref>. 2 Theorem 7 (Cut Elimination for CLV ) ; CLV CLV Proof: We first show admissibility the cut rules in CLV simulteneously by three nested inductions on the complexity of the cut formula, the length of the left derivation of the left premise and the length of the derivation of <p> This allows a another proof of normalization for natural deductions: We annotate the natural deduction, possibly using both coercions if the derivation is not normal, translate the result to a sequent derivation, apply cut elimination (see <ref> [Pfe94a] </ref>) and then translate the result back to a normal natural deduction. 7.3 Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic We can extend the development for minimal linear logic to intuitionistic linear logic along the lines of Section 5.

Reference-contexts: Natural deduction has no explicit structural rules, and one of the pleasant properties of G 3 is that it also has no explicit structural rules. This simplifies inversion principles and can be used to give a much simpler proof of cut elimination than for LJ <ref> [Pfe94b] </ref>. We use G 3 for the system consisting of the rules below with the exception of Cut. <p> Cut elimination follows by an additional simple structural induction argument of G 3 derivations. For details of a related structural induction argument, see <ref> [Pfe94b] </ref>. 2 3 Classical Logic In natural deduction we obtain classical logic by adding another inference rule that breaks the symmetry of introduction and elimination rules. This rule might be excluded middle, indirect proof, or double negation elimination. <p> Another argument via translations to and from the classical version of G 3 is given in <ref> [Pfe94b] </ref>. 3.2 C 3 : A Sequent Calculus for Classical Logic without Structural Rules Again, we take exchange for granted. Weakening is built into initial sequents (by allow side formulas), contraction into each inference rule by copying the principal formula to all premises. Initial Sequents. I Cut. <p> Weakening and contraction do not change the structure of the proof. The equivalence to Gentzen's calculus LK is also easy to establish by inserting or removing appropriate structural rules; we skip the routine details here. For a proof of cut elimination for C 3 see <ref> [Pfe94b] </ref>. 4 Classical Linear Logic In this section we present a few variations of sequent calculi for classical linear logic. They can be distinguished along two dimensions: do they distinguish a left-hand and right-hand side or not, and do they distinguish linear from non-linear formula sequences.

Reference-contexts: This differs from traditional treatments by Abram-sky [Abr93], Troelstra <ref> [Tro93] </ref>, Bierman [Bie94] and Albrecht et al. [ABCS94] in that structural rules remain completely implicit. This has advantages and disadvantages. From the operational point of view, storage operations (weakening and contraction) are not as explicit as, say, in Abram-sky's or Bierman's calculi.
