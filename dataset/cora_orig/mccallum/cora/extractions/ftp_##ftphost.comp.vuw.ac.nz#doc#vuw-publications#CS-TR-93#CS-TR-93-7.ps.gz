Abstract: PO Box 600 Wellington New Zealand Tel: +64 4 471 5328 Fax: +64 4 495 5232 Internet: Tech.Reports@comp.vuw.ac.nz Technical Report CS-TR-93/7 November 1993 Abstract MetVUW Workbench is a multimedia database for retrieval and display of historical meteorological data, including laser disc video imagery, digital satellite imagery, text, hydrological data, and numeric fields from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting. Existing components of MetVUW Workbench allow this information to be retrieved by date and time, by full text search, or by scanning the laser disc. In developing MetVUW Workbench, interesting issues arose in five areas: interface design, memory organisation and data storage, management of the laser disc player, audio presentation of data, and use of publicly available software packages. This document reports on our experiences in the design and implementation of version 1.0 of MetVUW Workbench.

Reference-contexts: Two of us are actively engaged in the design of a mechanism for retrieving past weather situations from descriptions of high-level features of the meteorological processes and systems <ref> (Jones and Roydhouse, 1993) </ref>. 1 The remainder of this report is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the design issues that arose in constructing version 1.0 of MetVUW Workbench. Section 3 describes the underlying architecture of the system. Section 4 presents the user interface design.

Reference-contexts: The overlay computation library is derived from code written by Dr. Crispin Marks and implemented in FORTRAN. This code includes 4 a contouring algorithm which uses the St. Andrews Cells method and thus correctly contours saddle points <ref> (Sabin, 1986) </ref>. Other packages for image compression (JPEG), full text search (LQ-text), database management (NDBM), and Tcl/Tk itself are implemented in C. The Tcl code acts as the glue that brings these components of the implementation together to form a complete application, as discussed in section 8, below.

Reference-contexts: Using JPEG, a year of imagery requires only 200Mb of storage. 4. Help Facility MetVUW Workbench Version 1.0 is already a large application that requires a manual and an effective online help facility. We wrote the manual using GNU'S Texinfo system <ref> (Stallman and Chassell, 1993) </ref>. The Texinfo program automatically encodes the text of the manual in two ways: as a word-processed document, and in a hypertext format suitable for use by the GNU Info hypertext system.

Reference-contexts: We plan to construct facilities that make it easy to add or delete data. To solve this problem, we intend to switch to an extensible RDBMS called Postgres as a substrate to future versions of MetVUW Workbench <ref> (Stonebraker and Rowe, 1986) </ref>. This change will also facilitate the development of intelligent retrieval techniques. 2. Provide customisable false colouring and contouring. Currently, false colouring schemes are presets defined in configuration files, contours can only be constructed at preconfigured intervals, and contouring is limited to the horizontal plane.
