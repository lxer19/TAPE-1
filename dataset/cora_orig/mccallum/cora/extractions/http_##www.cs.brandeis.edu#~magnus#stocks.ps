Reference-contexts: An import property of W is that W (b; F ) is concave in b and linear in F, and W fl (F ) is convex in F (for a proof, see <ref> [3] </ref>.) That knowledge tells us that the set of log-optimal portfolios forms a convex set.

Reference-contexts: Understanding the portfolio problem as a decision problem under risk, showed to be extremely fruitful. Subsequently, Sharpe, Lintner and Mossin developed the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) which represents the core of the modern capital market theory (see <ref> [4] </ref>). 2 On Portfolio Management Before diving head trst into Information Theoretical aspects of portfolio selection, an introduction to some basic concepts from elementary Investment Theory is in order. 2.1 Indierence Curves and Risk Aversion The method used in selecting the most desirable portfolio involves the use of indierence curves.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore a good idea to start with a general introduction to general portfolio theory. The seminal work developing the modern portfolio theory is credited to Harry Markowitz (see <ref> [6] </ref>), co-winner of the 1990 Nobel prize in economics. Markowitz's approach begins by assuming that an investor has a given sum of money to invest at the present time.

Reference-contexts: Using variance as relevant risk measure comes from Markowitz's paper and is always used in practice, although other possibilities have been considered (see <ref> [8] </ref>.) This detnition gives us the following properties, assuming we have a 'rational investor' 1 : * All portfolios that lie on the same indierence curve are equally desirable to the investor (even though they have dierent expected returns and variance.) An obvious implication is that indierence curves do not intersect.
