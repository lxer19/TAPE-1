Abstract: Participatory design is the antithesis of traditional design in which designers are expected to exhibit their expertise. The right to participate in design is often ignored and even when it is accepted, many obstacles including perceived pragmatic/economic deficiencies and organizational concerns, impede participation. This paper criticizes the foundations of traditional design and elaborates some features of participation in various design disciplines particularly in the context of architectural design and urban planning. An approach to participation founded on widening communication channels among participants is presented. Finally, the potential applications of computer tools for supporting participation is discussed.

In keeping with the cascading nature of design, participatory design cannot be a one-shot affair. Rather, one-time participation may lead to benefits weakening over time [31]. Hence, effective participation requires continuous commitment.

Though a distinction can be drawn between co-design|where customers have access to some of the technical knowledge or dialogue|where customer have the social and informal knowledge but lack the technical knowledge, we advocate increasing access to technical knowledge and its translation for equal participation in a dialectical process.

Reference-contexts: In traditional design, participation is often side-stepped by reducing the user to a databank. Varieties of Participation Submitted to Design Studies Reich et al. November 8, 1995 Page 4 This is manifest in disciplines such as human factors or ergonomics that enable "representing the user in the design process" <ref> [12] </ref>. In this case, the best designers can achieve is by creating building blocks that allow users to adapt the product to their specific needs. Such situations result in the designer's demanding an objective evaluation of need as an integral part of the design process.

Whereas in a very short term project, synchronous communication between participants may answer most concerns, in a long term project, asynchronous communication becomes mandatory [39].

Reference-contexts: Knowledge is thereby instituted in the face of many different perspectives and for this reason is always subject to change, even radical change. This conception of knowledge is not new having been expressed by Peirce <ref> [26] </ref> and more recently by Feyerabend [27]. The acceptance of this new ideal encourages increasing participation as much as feasible but also requires organizational, and may benefit from computational, support to reconcile these contesting perspectives.

Reference-contexts: need to learn about the users' needs, about the context in which the problem is posed and about what may be a solution that will suit users' needs and "personality;" while the users need to learn about what is possible to achieve thereby potentially modifying their needs as initially perceived <ref> [28, 20] </ref>. In this ideal, each participant traces, follows, influences, and is influenced by the evolution of views of others, while all influence the progress and direction of the design process. <p> For example, although Winograd and Flores [37] have correctly pointed out that system breakdowns must be graceful, such a requirement cannot be formulated and satisfied by careful anticipation and designing as Winograd and Flores contend <ref> [28] </ref>. A formulation and its solution can be meaningful to practitioners only if it is obtained and maintained through participation. Such questions can lead to a wider view of participation as the democratizing of work [38].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we maintain that the different participants are equally important, and therefore, must have equal legitimacy in the process of design. Legitimacy of participation may be a prerequisite for the success of participation programs <ref> [29] </ref>. Our contention is that a social norm in which all design responsibility is expected to be assumed by the designer alone will inevitably lead to poorer designs than a social norm which calls for extending participation throughout design activity [23]. <p> As for the effects of participation on design quality, studies report positive, negligible, or no significant effects. By and large, cases with no significant effects are characterized by differential power between management and users, or between planners and citizens, or by the lack of legitimacy of participation groups <ref> [29] </ref>; i.e., by a distorted type of participation. Note also that failure may result from interpreting quality in a non-participatory manner. The fundamental question is whether the purpose of design is to satisfy customer requirements or user needs as they evolve.

Reference-contexts: However, the success of these interactions where participants were equally recognized as "experts" in their respective fields is in contrast to housing design. Experience in the latter suggests that acknowledging the right to participate is insufficient to cause change [5], when economic issues govern the consequences of participation <ref> [30] </ref>. In keeping with the cascading nature of design, participatory design cannot be a one-shot affair. Rather, one-time participation may lead to benefits weakening over time [31]. Hence, effective participation requires continuous commitment. Moreover, two issues must be addressed continuously: the content and form of participation.

Reference-contexts: The content, which refers to the issues discussed, change as all participants learn. The form also may evolve and must be determined based on the changing context of the design activity and experience accumulating from participatory projects <ref> [32] </ref>. Though the form should be managed, it should be done participatively; otherwise power differences will be maintained hindering cooperative work. There is a gap between the perception of design participation efficiency and its experienced outcome.

Reference-contexts: Thus the issue of the inefficiency of participation is directly circumscribed by the time-horizon one brings to the issue of design <ref> [33] </ref> and the resources initially spent. As for the effects of participation on design quality, studies report positive, negligible, or no significant effects.

Reference-contexts: Elsewhere, we challenge the traditional view that engineer Varieties of Participation Submitted to Design Studies Reich et al. November 8, 1995 Page 9 ing activities are mainly formal and demonstrate that the informal aspects of engineering comprises the majority of design <ref> [34] </ref>. The knowledge required and the knowledge of participants influence the role they can assume. Special efforts will be required to ensure that non-technical participants are not disenfranchised. Without pro-active training or special efforts to provide comprehensible information, participants without technical knowledge cannot be effective when technical knowledge is necessary. <p> Diverse information, formal and informal, needs to be recorded, made persistent, and organized as a shared memory [14] so that it can be accessed and used over a long period of time <ref> [34] </ref>. Whereas in a very short term project, synchronous communication between participants may answer most concerns, in a long term project, asynchronous communication becomes mandatory [39].

Reference-contexts: Such data can be widely disseminated given that the right computational and organizational support acts to loosen traditional hierarchical structures that increase opportunities for participation. There are risks embedded in this scenario <ref> [36] </ref>. First, users may initially be attracted to programs that do not require their active involvement. They Varieties of Participation Submitted to Design Studies Reich et al. November 8, 1995 Page 14 may prefer to rely on a tool rather than exercising their own judgment.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of ways of looking at the relationship between computation and participation. From one point of view the relationship concerns whether and to what extent computational products are developed through participation. For example, although Winograd and Flores <ref> [37] </ref> have correctly pointed out that system breakdowns must be graceful, such a requirement cannot be formulated and satisfied by careful anticipation and designing as Winograd and Flores contend [28]. A formulation and its solution can be meaningful to practitioners only if it is obtained and maintained through participation.

Reference-contexts: A formulation and its solution can be meaningful to practitioners only if it is obtained and maintained through participation.

Thus participation in all kinds and phases of production is at issue, including tools for supporting participation.
