Reference-contexts: Thus we need more than the floats in the official specification, we need the votes, with some attendant functionality. We have significantly scaled back that functionality since our last recommendation in <ref> [1] </ref>. Any serious HT user will want control over those processes outside the dotted line in Fig. 1. <p> There is even a significant amount of work that leads down the road to Witkin's "infinite regress of squiggle analysis", in which accumulator array patterns are analyzed by computer vision techniques... In <ref> [1] </ref> we devoted a section or two to converting a HT to a spatial index, basically. Nowadays we believe that Fig. 1 is more the way to go: let the user use whatever grouping or creation functions he wants to create his own image-level objects, spatial objects, and spatial indices. <p> Possibly there is a more specific class for this type of description. 2.2 Accumulation Structures and Spatial Indices The current IUE specification has the HT firmly as a subclass of the accumulation indices rather than the spatial indices. In <ref> [1] </ref> we worked on interpreting the semantics of many of the accumulation indices. The interested reader is referred to that paper for those attempts.
