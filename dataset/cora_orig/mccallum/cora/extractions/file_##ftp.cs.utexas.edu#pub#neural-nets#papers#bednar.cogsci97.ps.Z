Abstract: RF-LISSOM, a self-organizing model of laterally connected orientation maps in the primary visual cortex, was used to study the psychological phenomenon known as the tilt aftereffect. The same self-organizing processes that are responsible for the long-term development of the map and its lateral connections are shown to result in tilt aftereffects over short time scales in the adult. The model allows observing large numbers of neurons and connections simultaneously, making it possible to relate higher-level phenomena to low-level events, which is difficult to do experimentally. The results give computational support for the idea that direct tilt aftereffects arise from adaptive lateral interactions between feature detectors, as has long been surmised. They also suggest that indirect effects could result from the conservation of synaptic resources during this process. The model thus provides a unified computational explanation of self-organization and both direct and indirect tilt aftereffects in the primary visual cortex.

Reference-contexts: Although such experiments require even larger cortex and retina sizes, they should become practical in the near future. In addition, many similar phenomena such as aftereffects of curvature, motion, spatial frequency, size, position, and color have been documented in humans <ref> (Barlow 1990) </ref>. Since specific detectors for most of these features have been found in the cortex, RF-LISSOM should be able to account for them by the same process of decorrelation mediated by self-organizing lateral connections.

Reference-contexts: Simulations performed with only one type of weight (either afferent, lateral excitatory, or lateral inhibitory) adapting at a given time show that the inhibitory weights determine the shape of the curve for all angles <ref> (Bednar 1997) </ref>. The small component of the TAE resulting from adaptation of either type of excitatory weights is almost precisely opposite the total effect.

Reference-contexts: Now fixate upon the figure at the left. The vertical lines should appear slightly tilted to the right; this phenomenon is called the direct tilt aftereffect. If you fixate upon the horizontal lines at the right, they should appear barely tilted counterclockwise, demonstrating the indirect tilt aftereffect. <ref> (Adapted from Campbell and Maffei 1971.) </ref> to test in a detailed model of cortical function.

Reference-contexts: Assuming the perceived orientation is some sort of average over the orientation preferences of the activated neurons, the perceived orientation would thus show the direct TAE <ref> (Coltheart 1971) </ref>. The fatigue theory has been discredited because it has become apparent that the adaptation is mediated by the lateral connections between neurons, rather than changes occurring within the neurons themselves (Bednar 1997; Vidyasagar 1990).

Reference-contexts: Introduction The tilt aftereffect <ref> (TAE, Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref> is a simple but intriguing visual phenomenon. After staring at a pattern of tilted lines or gratings, subsequent lines appear to have a slight tilt in the opposite direction (Figure 1). <p> However, when the time course of the direct TAE is measured at a single orientation, the increase is approximately logarithmic with time <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>, eventually saturating at a level that depends upon the experimental protocol used (Greenlee and Magnussen 1987; Magnussen and Johnsen 1986). Figure 4 compares the shape of this TAE versus time curve for human subjects and for the RF-LISSOM model.

Reference-contexts: The effect resembles an afterimage from staring at a bright light, but it reflects changes in orientation perception rather than in color or brightness. Most modern explanations of the TAE are based on the feature-detector model of the visual cortex <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel 1968) </ref>. Individual orientation detectors become more difficult to excite during repeated presentation of oriented stimuli, and the desensitization persists for some time afterwards.

Reference-contexts: The elongated spots approximate natural visual stimuli after the edge detection and enhancement mechanisms in the retina. They can also be seen as a model of the intrinsic retinal activity waves that occur in late pre-natal development in mammals <ref> (Meister, Wong, Baylor, and Shatz 1991) </ref>. The RF-LISSOM network models the self-organization of the visual cortex based on these natural sources of elongated features. The afferent weights are initially set to random values, and the lateral weights are preset to a smooth Gaussian profile.

Reference-contexts: There is also extensive computational justification for synaptic resource conservation, beginning with one of the first computational models of Heb-bian adaptation (Rochester, Holland, Haibt, and Duda 1956). Without such normalization, connection weights governed by a Hebbian rule will increase indefinitely, or else each would reach a maximum strength <ref> (Miller and MacKay 1994) </ref>. Neither outcome would appear biologically or computationally plausible, so the assumption of some form of normalization is well-motivated (Sirosh 1995). Through mechanisms similar to those causing the TAE, the RF-LISSOM model should also be able to explain simultaneous tilt illusions between spatially separated stimuli.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 plots these differences after adaptation for 90 iterations of the RF-LISSOM algorithm. For comparison, figure 3 also shows the most detailed data available for the TAE in human foveal vision <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. The results from the RF-LISSOM simulation are strikingly similar to the psychophysical results. For the range 5 ffi to 40 ffi , all subjects in the human study (including the one shown) exhibited angle repulsion effects nearly identical to those found in the RF-LISSOM model.

Reference-contexts: The fatigue theory has been discredited because it has become apparent that the adaptation is mediated by the lateral connections between neurons, rather than changes occurring within the neurons themselves (Bednar 1997; Vidyasagar 1990). The now-popular inhibition theory postulates that tilt aftereffects result from changing inhibition between neurons <ref> (Tolhurst and Thompson 1975) </ref>, perhaps by increases in the strength of lateral connections between them. Although the inhibition theory was first proposed in the 1970s, only recently has it become computationally feasible your eye slightly inside the circle to avoid developing strong afterimages.

Reference-contexts: A main contribution of the RF-LISSOM model of the TAE is its novel explanation of the indirect effect. Proponents of the lateral inhibitory theory of direct effects have generally ignored indirect effects, or postulated that they occur only at higher cortical levels <ref> (Wenderoth and Johnstone 1988) </ref>, partly because it has not been clear how they could arise through inhibition in V1. RF-LISSOM demonstrate that a quite simple, local mechanism in V1 is sufficient to produce indirect effects.
