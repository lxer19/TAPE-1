Title: Design Rule Checker for Sheet Metal Components using Medial Axis Transforms and Geometric Reasoning

Abstract: Design Rule Checker is an essential component of design automation and for making design, process planning and manufacturing concurrent. In this paper, a set of algorithms are presented for detecting design violations in sheet metal components. Violations in sheet metal components occur when holes, slots, or other features are too close to one another. These violations, if undetected during design, increase the design life cycle of the product. Thus it is very essential to detect, if not eliminate these violations at the early stages of design. Typically sheet metal components have a number of features serving various purposes which include ventilation and fastening. As the contour of the parts gets complicated and the number of features on the sheet metal part increases it is difficult to check the rules exhaustively as it may lead to combinatorial explosion.

Reference-contexts: Luby discusses issues related to capturing design violations and even cap 6 tures some intrafeature violations (which can be avoided by designing features using variational geometry), but does not address the problem of interfeature violations that may occur in many mechanical components. Cutkosky <ref> [Cutk90] </ref>, points out the possibility of interfeature violation but, it is not clear how they detect it automatically or otherwise. However, they are able to capture intrafeature violations using geometric constraints. Malmqvist [Malmq] focused on considering manufacturing requirements early in the design process using parametric design approach.

Reference-contexts: Malmqvist [Malmq] focused on considering manufacturing requirements early in the design process using parametric design approach. In this approach the researcher imposes the minimum dimensions of the feature parameters as constraints during the creation process thus eliminating the possibility of intrafeature violation. DeFazio <ref> [Defaz] </ref> stressed the general need for better quality designs of manufactured products and indicated (as many others have) that 70% or more of the life cycle cost of a product is determined during the early design process.

One of the options not covered in [Kamr94] is that of moving the feature to 26 another location. This option is discussed here. 7.1 Moving Features As discussed in section 5 most of the manufacturability rules involve proximity conditions. Thus, moving, i.e, repositioning the features is one way to correct violations.

The Voronoi diagram, i.e. internal medial axis of the external boundary, is computed using the algorithm developed by Lee <ref> [Lee82] </ref>. A modification of Lee's algorithm was used to compute external medial axis of the internal boundary. After the internal and external MATs are computed separately, they are superimposed and their merge curve is computed. The merge curve is the bisector between the boundaries whose Voronoi diagrams are being merged.

Reference-contexts: Gadh et al.[Gadh91] addressed various issues in knowledge-based manufactura-bility analysis. In their approach Gadh and his team use Differential Depth Perception Filter (DDPF) which is analogous to human discernation of object outlines in recognizing features, during which they check for violation in feature parameters. Nielsen et al. <ref> [Niels91] </ref> continued the work done by Luby in automatic design evaluation. This work was one step towards responding to some of the criticism by Shah and Wilson. This was an extensive work done in capturing both intrafeature and interfeature violations.

Reference-contexts: Generating Voronoi diagrams for multiply-connected polygons involves three main steps; generating the internal MAT of the external boundary, generating the external MAT of the internal boundaries and blending the external and internal MAT's generated henceforth. The algorithm, developed by Srinivasan and Nackman <ref> [srini87] </ref> is used to compute the Voronoi diagram of a multiply-connected polygonal domain, V OD ([ H j=0 @), where H is the number of polygons. The algorithm does this by computing the individual Voronoi diagrams V OD (@! j ); j = 0; :::; H, and then merging them.
