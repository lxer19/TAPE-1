Title: Abstract  
Keyword: Automated graphics generation, heterogeneous data characterization, visual information classification, coherent visual discourse, visual design principles.  
Abstract: Automated visual presentation systems should be able to design effective presentations for heterogeneous (quantitative and qualitative) information. They should also be able to work in static or interactive environments and capable of employing a wide range of visual media and visual techniques. In this paper, we focus on three tasks in building visual production systems: establishing a thorough understanding of the presentation-related characteristics of domain-specific information; classifying several types of visual information and capturing their distinct syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features; and formulating a set of design principles. We define a data-analysis taxonomy to characterize heterogeneous information. In addition, we have modeled presentation context information such as audience identity to produce user-centered visual design. To utilize and manipulate visual information, we have classified it into visual objects and visual tools based upon its role in the visual production process. To guide the visual design process, we have formulated a set of design principles that ensure the expressiveness and effectiveness of a design. To test and evaluate our work, we have developed a prototype system called IMPROVISE based on the research results. We use examples generated by IMPROVISE to illustrate how it constructs visual presentations.

Reference-contexts: The above description fragment also indicates the patients esh color through its material description. While the form and material describe a data objects natural visual appearance, other data attributes such as transience and importance are used to describe the intrinsic properties of the information mentioned in <ref> (Arens et al., 1993) </ref>. These are especially useful for grouping or partitioning information when a large amount of information is to be conveyed. Transience describes whether an object is dynamic or static. <p> We adopt the composite object attribute categorizations discussed in (Roth and Mattis, 1990) and <ref> (Arens et al., 1993) </ref>, and extend them to address a wider range of information. The following attributes are tied directly to composite objects only: ordering, scalability, and continuity. Within a composite object, components may be ordered in a certain way. <p> In contrast, amounts, which usually can be mapped to scalable visual variables, signify the quantitative measurement used to describe a particular attribute of an object (e.g., the price in dollars of a car). Arens et al. <ref> (Arens et al., 1993) </ref> introduce the continuity property of quantitative data sets: data sets can be discrete or continuous. The continuity property can help the system determine the visual representation form. <p> On the other hand, when the request is to display several relations together, it is necessary to take into account the interconnections between those relations in order to integrate all related information in one presentation. Attributes of Data Relations. We use a straightforward combination of dimensionality <ref> (Arens et al., 1993) </ref>, along with coverage, cardinality, and uniqueness (Roth and Mattis, 1990), to describe the attributes of a relation. In a dynamic application domain, such as network management, the properties of data relations can change over time.

Reference-contexts: We partition visual information into two categories: visual objects and visual tools. Visual objects, in this paradigm, are syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic encodings of various visualization units defined at different levels of abstraction, ranging from the most basic visual variables <ref> (Bertin, 1983) </ref> to high-level complex visual forms, such as animated sequences of 3D pictures (Lohse et al., 1994). Visual tools, on the other hand, are visual techniques that are used to assemble or modify visual objects. <p> Visual primitives (Figure 5b) basically are visual variables. There are six types of visual variables: shape, material, texture, size, position, and orientation <ref> (Bertin, 1983) </ref>. These variables are the most basic building blocks that participate in visual object synthesis. Without fixed meaning apart from a visual context, individual visual primitives can hardly communicate any information or be used to fulfill a particular information-seeking goal. Visual Unities.

Reference-contexts: Data Role To generate effective presentations, not only do we need to know the datas intrinsic properties (e.g., data type or data attributes), but we also need to identify the information-presentation tasks. Casner <ref> (Casner, 1991) </ref> discusses how user tasks can affect the presentation design, while Roth and Mattis (Roth and Mattis, 1990) also analyze data properties based on the users or applications information-seeking goals.

Reference-contexts: To provide an interruptible and responsive visual discourse, we are currently working on a reactive planning algorithm to deal with replanning the visual discourse design. We have used IMPROVISE in two very different application domains. One is a computer network management application that visualizes a networks structure and behavior <ref> (Crutcher et al., 1995) </ref>. The other is a healthcare application that provides a caregiver with a multimedia summary of a patients medical record (Dalal et al., 1996a). <p> and behavior <ref> (Crutcher et al., 1995) </ref>. The other is a healthcare application that provides a caregiver with a multimedia summary of a patients medical record (Dalal et al., 1996a). In the computer network management domain, we use IMPROVISE to help network researchers or network managers understand aspects of network activities (Crutcher et al., 1995). A presentation tool helps these users to establish network service hierarchies, and develop or verify their network management algorithms. In the medical domain, our research focuses on effectively organizing patient information and presenting it coherently as a multimedia summary (Dalal et al., 1996a).

Since the multimedia summary contains coordinated text, speech, and visual pre 21 sentations, constructing a working system is a collaborative effort that involves researchers from several areas including knowledge representation, natural language generation, and graphics generation. <p> Although the finished presentation contains coordinated speech, text, and graphics, we focus here on how IMPROVISE acts as a graphics generator in a collaborative multimedia system. According to our informal design studies <ref> (Dalal et al., 1996a) </ref>, nurses in our domain prefer that all relevant information be placed near a representation of the patients physical body and displayed at once (rather than successively revealed).

ACM Multimedia 96, </booktitle> <pages> pages 55 64, </pages> <address> Boston, MA. </address>
Reference-contexts: Medium indicates what media are available. For example, if speech needs to be incorporated in the presentation, the visual design process must deal with certain media coordination issues <ref> (Dalal et al., 1996b) </ref>. Environment Since the visual presentations always need to be designed on certain computers or presented on certain displays, there is another type of information that specifies the existing physical system environment under which the presentation is being planned and realized. <p> Since the multimedia summary contains coordinated text, speech, and visual pre 21 sentations, constructing a working system is a collaborative effort that involves researchers from several areas including knowledge representation, natural language generation, and graphics generation. Of the various components in the MAGIC multmedia summarization system <ref> (Dalal et al., 1996b) </ref>, IMPROVISE serves as the graphics generator. MAGIC addresses two types of caregivers: nurses and doctors. <p> Based on the syntactic specifications of TABLE-CHART (Figure 6a), the system refines the abstract table chart by determining its heading and populating its cells. Based on the grouping information provided by MAGICs high-level general content planner <ref> (Dalal et al., 1996b) </ref>, IMPROVISE makes three cells at this level: identification including age, gender, and mrn in one cell, medical history by itself in one, and surgeon and operation in the third cell to describe the operation.

Reference-contexts: The effectiveness of visual presentations is a function of context information. The more comprehensive the context information is, the better the visual presentations will suit the user or situation it represents. Other researchers have modeled and utilized context information, such as Friedells situation space <ref> (Friedell, 1983) </ref> and Mackinlays display categories (Mackinlay, 1986), to index the knowledge base and facilitate the selection of synthesis operations. However, the modeled context information is usually very limited.

Reference-contexts: For example, our visual language currently interfaces with Open Inventor (Wernecke, 1994). We have also integrated various interaction metaphors and styles into design rules to produce visual affor-dances <ref> (Gibson, 1977) </ref>. Thus, IMPROVISEs interaction handler may receive user interactions in the course of a presentation. To provide an interruptible and responsive visual discourse, we are currently working on a reactive planning algorithm to deal with replanning the visual discourse design.

Reference-contexts: Visual objects, in this paradigm, are syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic encodings of various visualization units defined at different levels of abstraction, ranging from the most basic visual variables (Bertin, 1983) to high-level complex visual forms, such as animated sequences of 3D pictures <ref> (Lohse et al., 1994) </ref>. Visual tools, on the other hand, are visual techniques that are used to assemble or modify visual objects. These visual tools can be further distinguished by their functions: assembly tools that compose visual objects and transformational tools that modify existing visual objects. <p> These five senses roughly define five different categories of visual representation forms <ref> (Lohse et al., 1994) </ref>. One way to display information is through a textual label (e.g., the patients name displayed at the top of Figure 2). A label can be enriched by adding graphics, such as underscoring or a button shape, to convey additional information. <p> This plot indicates how height changes with the age. Conventional visual structural classification used in cognitive psychology (Winn and Holliday, 1982) identifies three basic structures that fall between text and realistic images: charts, graphs, and diagrams. Based on the visual representation classification proposed by Lohse <ref> (Lohse et al., 1994) </ref>, we have extended our visual structure classification. For example, graphs are further partitioned into scatter plots, bar graphs, etc. <p> Structure all patient information together based on these rules: To satisfy the goal Structure, IMPROVISE employs an assembly tool DesignStructureDiagram to make a structure diagram, since a structure diagram is capable of conveying a physical structure (the patients body) and expressing the spatial coordinates of related objects (e.g., medical devices) <ref> (Lohse et al., 1994) </ref>. However, DesignStructureDiagram only produces an empty STRUCTURE-DIAGRAM, and IMPROVISE needs to fill in all the missing parts.

Reference-contexts: To apply design rules for different visual objects at different stages, we define these rules in terms of their achievements at different levels of abstraction. At a high level, design rules are used to ensure global expressiveness or effectiveness <ref> (Mackinlay, 1986) </ref> of a visual discourse, while at a low level, they maintain semantic integrity or coordinate visual fitness within a single visual object synthesis. 3 In the rest of this article, we first discuss related research in the area of automated visual presentation design. <p> However, NSP focuses only on addressing characteristics of quantitative data and their representation forms. In contrast, we attempt to find a more comprehensive and systematic treatment for representing heterogeneous data, including both quantitative and qualitative information. Both APT <ref> (Mackinlay, 1986) </ref> and SAGE (Roth and Mattis, 1991) automatically generate 2D visual presentations of quantitative information. They both adopt a systematic data characterization method for quantitative data, and a visual language for describing various 2D graphs and charts. <p> For example, different sizes cannot normally be used to encode an ordinal ordering, as different shapes are ineffective in representing a quantitative ordering. How quantitative ordering affects graphic design decisions has been carefully examined in both <ref> (Mackinlay, 1986) </ref> and (Roth and Mattis, 1990). We extend the ordering attribute to qualitative data, and analyze how such qualitative ordering inuences the spatial and temporal order of an information presentation. Within a composite object, its components may be logically ordered. <p> Therefore, in our applications, plot is further distinguished using structure (organizing information by their physical structure), map (displaying information by a map), and trace (organizing information by their temporal order in a time chart). Quantitative information can usually be effectively expressed in plot sense. The research of <ref> (Mackinlay, 1986) </ref> and (Roth and Mattis, 1990) is mostly concerned with how to generate appropriate visual presentations automatically in plot sense. Representing a piece of information in symbol sense involves the use of a visual variable or an icon to symbolize the information. <p> The more comprehensive the context information is, the better the visual presentations will suit the user or situation it represents. Other researchers have modeled and utilized context information, such as Friedells situation space (Friedell, 1983) and Mackinlays display categories <ref> (Mackinlay, 1986) </ref>, to index the knowledge base and facilitate the selection of synthesis operations. However, the modeled context information is usually very limited. As modeling the user or the environment is a sizable task itself, we decided to analyze and model several types of key information. <p> Under the categorization of expressiveness and effectiveness, we first discuss visual design rules in general. Then we present rule representation in conjunction with the properties of domain and visual information. 17 Rule Type. Rules for visual design can be divided into two categories: expressiveness rules and effectiveness rules <ref> (Mackinlay, 1986) </ref>. Under this broad classification, rules can be defined more concretely to ensure a particular aspect of an expressiveness or effectiveness criterion. For example, to satisfy a specific expressiveness or effectiveness criterion, the rule could even be further refined at the object level.

Reference-contexts: For example, if we are to produce a patient record summary for caregivers, we need to include all related information in the summary, as well as to stress the patients abnormal conditions. While generality regards the ability to express high-level groupings or abstractions of information <ref> (Mullet and Sano, 1995) </ref>, discreteness describes the ability to break the information into parts so that the user can access the information selectively. <p> Although this constraint appears to be one of the syntactic constraints used in a table charts construction, it is not hard to justify the semantic rationale behind this constraint: domain objects having closer relationships should be placed closer to each other to satisfy gestalt grouping theory <ref> (Mullet and Sano, 1995) </ref>. In the demographics table chart, the object age is represented by its attribute name Age and its value 80.

Reference-contexts: In an attributive relation, some objects describe certain aspects (attributes) of other objects. Furthermore, these relations can be effectively encoded by the corresponding images visual attributes, such as its shape, size, or color. Enumeration includes both isa and instance relations <ref> (Rich and Knight, 1991) </ref>. Thus, an enumerative relation shows class inclusion (e.g., pitbull isa dog) or class membership (e.g., Spot is an instance of dog). Figure 2a uses a label on a button to convey the concept of DRIP (i.e., intravenously administered drugs) received by the patient.

Reference-contexts: Although context information comes from a wide variety of sources, we partition them into three categories: audience, occasion, and environment. These roughly correspond to the information categories that a speaker is 11 expected to know before s/he gives a verbal presentation <ref> (Ross, 1997) </ref>. To make an effective presentation, whether verbal or visual, context information plays an important role in design, as well as delivery. Audience The audience is the ultimate judge of a presentations effectiveness. Knowing the audience better helps to customize the presentation to the audiences interest.

Reference-contexts: This information could vary a great deal from one domain to another. To formulate general rules that help map the information to visual discourse, we must understand presentation-related properties that are common to all information. This task is called data characterization <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref>. To characterize heterogeneous data systematically and comprehensively, we have developed a six-dimensional data-analysis taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we discuss how domain data is organized and represented to capture various presentation-related properties and aid the design process. <p> However, the complexity of data types handled by SAGE and the richness of its visual language are significantly advanced over APT. Unlike APT, which designs visual displays completely relying on the data characteristics, SAGE also incorporates information seeking goals into its design process <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref>. However, both systems focus on generating individual displays for quantitative information. They do not address issues such as providing transitions between displays or integrating new information into existing displays. <p> Roth and Mattis <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref> characterize data with regard to quantitative domains such as time, space, temperature, and mass; for example, to allow temperature to be preferentially displayed along a vertical axis. We generalize this classification to accommodate a broader range of information. <p> We adopt the composite object attribute categorizations discussed in <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref> and (Arens et al., 1993), and extend them to address a wider range of information. The following attributes are tied directly to composite objects only: ordering, scalability, and continuity. Within a composite object, components may be ordered in a certain way. <p> For example, different sizes cannot normally be used to encode an ordinal ordering, as different shapes are ineffective in representing a quantitative ordering. How quantitative ordering affects graphic design decisions has been carefully examined in both (Mackinlay, 1986) and <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref>. We extend the ordering attribute to qualitative data, and analyze how such qualitative ordering inuences the spatial and temporal order of an information presentation. Within a composite object, its components may be logically ordered. <p> Using this property, the display (with demographics shown at the top of Figure 2a) is arranged in a way that presents identification (MRN, age, gender) before medical history (History) based on a left-to-right reading order. (*****Insert Figure2 Near Here*****) Roth and Mattis <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref> further distinguish quantitative data sets using coordinates and amounts. Coordinates specify points in a domain (e.g., the purchase date of the car), and usually cannot be represented by scalable visual variables such as size. <p> Data Relations Characterization along the dimension of data relations captures various types of relationships among objects. We extend the scope of the data relations (e.g., functional dependency) mentioned in <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref> by including semantic relations among data such as the constituent, attributive, and enumerative relationships shown in Figure 3. (*****Insert Figure3 Near Here*****) 8 The constituency relation corresponds to the has-part relation and can be further partitioned into physical constituency and conceptual constituency. <p> Attributes of Data Relations. We use a straightforward combination of dimensionality (Arens et al., 1993), along with coverage, cardinality, and uniqueness <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref>, to describe the attributes of a relation. In a dynamic application domain, such as network management, the properties of data relations can change over time. <p> Data Role To generate effective presentations, not only do we need to know the datas intrinsic properties (e.g., data type or data attributes), but we also need to identify the information-presentation tasks. Casner (Casner, 1991) discusses how user tasks can affect the presentation design, while Roth and Mattis <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref> also analyze data properties based on the users or applications information-seeking goals. We use the data role dimension to characterize the functional role each piece of information plays in a visual presentation context. In other words, data 9 role specifies visual tasks that need to achieved. <p> Quantitative information can usually be effectively expressed in plot sense. The research of (Mackinlay, 1986) and <ref> (Roth and Mattis, 1990) </ref> is mostly concerned with how to generate appropriate visual presentations automatically in plot sense.

As our goal is to generate coherent visual discourse, the consistency, continuity and unity criteria do their parts to maintain global and local coherence.

We have also integrated various interaction metaphors and styles into design rules to produce visual affor-dances (Gibson, 1977). Thus, IMPROVISEs interaction handler may receive user interactions in the course of a presentation.

Reference-contexts: For example, an organization chart can be composed from the images of a companys employees. Visual Structures. Visual structures (Figure 5d) spatially organize various visual unities and other visual structures in a specific way to convey abstract concepts or explain how processes work <ref> (Winn, 1987) </ref>. For example, a 2D line graph that plots height against age can be composed of line segments and two orthogonal axes with textual labels. This plot indicates how height changes with the age.

Reference-contexts: For example, a 2D line graph that plots height against age can be composed of line segments and two orthogonal axes with textual labels. This plot indicates how height changes with the age. Conventional visual structural classification used in cognitive psychology <ref> (Winn and Holliday, 1982) </ref> identifies three basic structures that fall between text and realistic images: charts, graphs, and diagrams. Based on the visual representation classification proposed by Lohse (Lohse et al., 1994), we have extended our visual structure classification.

Reference-contexts: Next, frame2, containing a sphere, will replace frame1 and stay on the screen for 6 seconds. The transition from the first frame to the second uses a cross-fade technique <ref> (Zettl, 1990) </ref>. Even though our object-oriented representation of a visual object looks like a template definition, there are substantial differences between them. A template is a completely specified parametrized description, of which all parameters are fully constrained in terms of their values.

Reference-contexts: Instead, we store visual unities representing atomic domain objects in the knowledge base, and use them as building blocks for composing more complex visual displays. We refer to a collection of such pre-stored visual unities as a visual lexicon <ref> (Zhou and Feiner, 1997a) </ref>. To deal with different visual media, visual unities are not just limited to graphical objects. They also include textual documents, static images, and video clips. These premade visual unities can also participate in visual object synthesis. <p> For example, attribute queries (e.g., how close two objects are) and the details of visual tools (e.g., how to enlarge an object) are captured in procedural formalism. We have implemented a hierarchical-decomposition partial-order planner <ref> (Zhou and Feiner, 1997a) </ref> as IMPROVISEs inference engine. Using this planner, IMPROVISE achieves computational efficiency by reducing the amount of search needed compared to systems that use simple search-based algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The decision to choose a specific decomposition method is based on the characteristics of the input (?domain-obj). If the current ?domain-obj is a composite data object, decomposition1 is usually selected <ref> (Zhou and Feiner, 1997b) </ref>. <p> To avoid constructing every visual presentation from scratch, we store the possible visual representations for atomic objects in a visual lexicon <ref> (Zhou and Feiner, 1997b) </ref>. Instantiations of visual lexical items are directly used as building blocks in a design. At this point in our example, each item (e.g., age or gender) is already atomic, so IMPROVISE searches through the visual lexicon to find appropriate representations for them.

Reference-contexts: It could be given by a user during interaction, or could be expressed by domain experts during knowledge acquisition. Based on previous task taxonomies (e.g., Roth and Mattis, 1990; Wehrend and Lewis, 1990), we develop a visual task taxonomy to describe various visual tasks more comprehensively <ref> (Zhou and Feiner, 1998) </ref>. A visual task description actually implies a desired visual relation among different objects. For example, visual task (*******Insert Footnote 2 here*******) Identify&lt;identifier, object&gt; signifies that there should be a visual identification relation between two objects: the identifier and the object to be identified.
