Abstract: We develop high resolution shock capturing numerical schemes for hyperbolic systems with relaxation. In such systems the relaxation time may vary from order one to much less than unity. When the relaxation time is small, the relaxation term becomes very strong and highly stiff, and underresolved numerical schemes may produce spurious results. Usually one can not decouple the problem into separate regimes and handle different regimes with different methods. Thus it is important to have a scheme that works uniformly with respect to the relaxation time. Using the Broadwell model of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation we develop a second order scheme that works effectively, with a fixed spatial and temporal discretization, for all range of mean free path. Formal uniform consistency proof for a first order scheme, and numerical convergence proof for the second order scheme are also presented. We also make numerical comparisons of the new scheme with some other schemes. This study is motivated by the reentry problem in hypersonic computations. fl Department of Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA.

Reference-contexts: In the last section we present some numerical results, which show that NSPIF overperform several other approaches and always give second order, physical solutions over a wide range of the mean free path. 2 The Broadwell Model A simple discrete velocity kinetic model for a gas was introduced by Broad-well <ref> [2] </ref>. It describes a 2-D (3-D) gas as composed of particles of only four (six) velocities with a binary collision law and spatial variation in only one direction.

In order to have the correct 15 behavior, the numerical scheme should have the same projection in the first time step. <p> Such an assumption is necessary since the continuous Chapman-Enskog expansion, which leads from the Broadwell equation to the Euler equation, is only justified for smooth solutions <ref> [3] </ref> or weak shocks [30]. This formal analysis, although not rigorous, does provide a effective tool to understand underresolved (grid spacing does not resolve *) numerical methods for hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxations [19], [17],[16], [18]. Following [19], we distinct the grid spacing into three regimes.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis is based on the assumption of smoothness of the solution. To the best of our knowledge this is the first estimate on numerical methods for hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation terms, even for smooth solution. Also the uniformly first order accuracy sharpens earlier work in this direction <ref> [14] </ref>. Estimates on non-smooth solutions or on higher order methods for such a inhomogeneous hyperbolic systems would require more advanced analytic techniques and are beyond the scope of this paper.

One possibility to overcome this burden is simply to resolve the initial layer, by using a time step t t " in the first few steps, and then switch to a larger time step. <p> Remark: In [24] Pember found that in the limit * ! 0 a second order space discretization may reduced to first order in a fractional step method.
