Abstract: We quantify the observation by Kender and Freudenstein [12] that degenerate views occupy a significant fraction of the viewing sphere surrounding an object. This demonstrates that systems for recognition must explicitly account for the possibility of view degeneracy. We show that view degeneracy cannot be detected from a single camera viewpoint. As a result, systems designed to recognize objects from a single arbitrary viewpoint must be able to function in spite of possible undetected degeneracies, or else operate with imaging parameters that cause acceptably low probabilities of degeneracy. To address this need, we give a prescription for active control of focal length that allows a principled tradeoff between the camera field of view and probability of view degeneracy.

Reference-contexts: For example, if two object edges are abutted and collinear, one longer edge is seen in their place. 1 Given arbitrarily high resolution, such alignments would not be a problem, because they would occur only for a vanishingly small fraction of the possible viewpoints <ref> [4] </ref>. Unfortunately, cameras and feature-extracting operators have finite resolution. We shall see in this paper that this enlarges the set of viewpoints that are problematic. We begin by defining view degeneracy precisely, and showing how our definition covers many interesting classes of degeneracy. <p> Since these loci of points are of lower dimensionality than the viewing sphere itself, the probability that the viewpoint is on such loci is vanishingly small. Infinitesimal probabilities of view degeneracy would potentially allow strong inferences to be made about scene structure <ref> [4] </ref>. Consider a certain coincidence, C, of simple object features A and B.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, small focal length increases the probability of view degeneracy. A similar tradeoff has been noted in the work of Brunnstrom <ref> [5] </ref> who uses a wide angle of view to detect object junctions and then zooms in to increase image resolution for junction clasification.

In the 3-D recognition work of Dickinson, Pentland and Rosenfeld <ref> [6, 7] </ref>, complex volumetric primitives are also recovered from a single 2-D image. A distinctive feature of this approach is the use of part-based aspect matching techniques to recover the primitives from the image. This approach requires the estimation of the probabilities of different aspects, including the so-called degenerate ones. <p> If, the mapping from a recovered view to an object model, or part, is ambiguous, then the various interpretations should be rank-ordered to provide a more efficient search <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. A more effective solution to dealing with ambiguity is to take an active approach. Wilkes [19] has explored the idea of moving the camera to a viewpoint advantageous to recognition. This approach also meets with success, but at the cost of significant viewpoint changes.

Reference-contexts: The probabilities were estimated by determining what set of regions was visible from each point on a discretized viewing sphere. Given an edge-based segmentation technique, the so-called degenerate views (or aspects) were found to have nontrivial probabilities. More recently, Shimshoni and Ponce <ref> [16] </ref> note that "accidental views" will appear over a finite region of the viewing sphere when considering finite resolution. Assuming orthographic projection, they present an algorithm for constructing the finite resolution aspect graph of a polyhedron.
