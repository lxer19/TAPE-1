Abstract: The continuous Fourier transform is a standard tool for the analysis of subdivision schemes. We present a new technique based on the discrete Fourier transform instead. We first prove a general convergence criterion for the case of arbitrary in-terpolatory schemes, i.e., for non-stationary, globally supported or even non-linear schemes. Since this criterion can be tested for a given scheme without considering a consistent parametrization of the iteratively generated polygons, we can arbitrarily reparametrize the polygons in every step. This allows us to formulate sufficient criteria for the convergence of subdivision schemes which are simple and numerically stable to evaluate. For illustration we analyze some example schemes.
