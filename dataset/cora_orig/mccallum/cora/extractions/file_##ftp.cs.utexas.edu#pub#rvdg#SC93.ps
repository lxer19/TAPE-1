Abstract: communications primitives, even when they increase the number of messages, and perhaps even the volume of traffic. However, both represent difficulties in coding, particularly for Method 3, where the overlapping of communication and computation is achieved only with a complex code. Further, this approach does not scale well for fixed problem sizes. The last two implementations retain portability and modularity, while yielding good performance across a range of machine sizes, even when the problem size is fixed. The final implementation places lower requirements on the communication network. We should observe that all of these implementations ignore special sparsity structure in A. Randomization is a reasonable approach to obtaining load balancing [10], but if load balance can be obtained otherwise, the sparsity structure of A may permit special purpose communication patterns. Our implementations, especially Method 5, should be regarded as "best general purpose", or perhaps "best worst case", approaches.
