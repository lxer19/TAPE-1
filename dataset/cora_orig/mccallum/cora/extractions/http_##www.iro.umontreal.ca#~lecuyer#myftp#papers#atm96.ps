Abstract: We estimate, by simulation, the cell-loss rate in an ATM switch modeled as a queueing network. Cell losses are rare events, so estimating their frequency by simulation is hard. We experiment with importance sampling as a mean of improving the simulation efficiency in that context.

Reference-contexts: The A-cycles are then asymptotically identically distributed (their initial state follows ) but not independent . To reduce the dependence, and also improve the normality, one can batch them, as in the batch means method <ref> (Bratley, Fox, and Schrage 1987) </ref>. One then applies the standard methodology for computing a confidence interval for a ratio of expectations, using the batch means as observations. Suppose we take b batches of k = n=b successive observations (X i ; Y i ) each.
