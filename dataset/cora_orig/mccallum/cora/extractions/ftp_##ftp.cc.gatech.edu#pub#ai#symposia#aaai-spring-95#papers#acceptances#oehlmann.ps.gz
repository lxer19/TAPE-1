Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Metacognition addresses the issues of knowledge about cognition and regulating cognition. We argue that the regulation process should be improved with growing experience. Therefore mental models are needed which facilitate the re-use of previous regulation processes. We will satisfy this requirement by describing a case-based approach to Introspection Planning which utilises previous experience obtained during reasoning at the meta-level and at the object level. The introspection plans used in this approach support various metacognitive tasks which are identified by the generation of self-questions. As an example of introspection planning, the metacognitive behaviour of our system, IULIAN, is described.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Experimental results from both psychologists and instructional scientists suggest that human cognitive performance can be improved by the use of metacognitive skills such as self-monitoring, prediction, and self-questioning (Wong & Jones, 1982; Wong, 1985). The term metacognition has been used in different ways <ref> (Gavelek & Raphael, 1985) </ref>. However there is an increasing tendency to follow Flavell (1976), who related metacognition to metamemory (Brown, 1987; Cam-pione, 1987). Metamemory has been defined by Flavell and Wellman (1977) as an agents knowledge about his/her memory.

Reference-contexts: If this approach is applied to plans rather than to problem/solution pairs, we refer to it as case-based planning <ref> (Hammond, 1989) </ref>. Often case-based reasoning systems use memories indexed in terms of prediction failures which occurred during the reasoning process. When the system generates a wrong prediction, the case on which the prediction was based is annotated with a characterisation of the failure situation. <p> The bindings are used to instantiate variables in the step actions. In the collector slots, intermediate results are stored during the question formation process. Each planning step has precondition, goal, and action slots to ensure correct plan execution. If plan execution fails, the usual explanation-based repair mechanisms are employed, <ref> (see Hammond, 1989) </ref>. It is an important advantage of the case-based planning approach that new questions can be learned by modifying previous questions plans.

Reference-contexts: We will use the discovery task to exemplify the issue of regulating cognition and representing the regulation process. It has been noted that human discoverers can be characterised as experimenters or theorists according to the discovery strategies employed <ref> (Klahr & Dunbar, 1988) </ref>. Experimenters attempt to deduce regularities from experimental results. In contrast, theorists are able to generate a hypothesis by search processes without any experimen tation; the hypothesis is then tested experimentally. We will use an example to motivate the idea of representing the regulation of cognitive processes. <p> During its execution, the reasoning strategy has to be 1. This strategy is consistent with psychological results which have suggested that subjects perform experiments if the generation of hypotheses is not successful <ref> (Klahr & Dunbar, 1988) </ref>. monitored. This process is again supported by the interaction between self-questions and introspection plans. First the result of the experiment modification is compared with the initial experiment.

Reference-contexts: In Artificial Intelligence systems, experience related to a given domain and the ability to be reminded of previous experience have been modelled by the paradigm of Case-Based Reasoning, where previous experience is usually represented as cases <ref> (see Kolodner 1993 for an overview) </ref>. Important components of the case-based reasoning approach are the retrieval of a previous case which contains a previous problem and its solution, and the adaptation of this case to obtain a solution for the current problem.

Reference-contexts: Causal models have a similar representation to experiments. However, they are stored in a separate library and their objects are viewed as abstract concepts, e.g. the concept lamp rather than an actual lamp used in a given experiment <ref> (Oehlmann, 1992) </ref>. In addition, causal models use particular relations between concepts to represent causal links. A causal model is linked to the experiment used to generate that model. Question plans are used to apply case-based planning techniques to the generation of single questions.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, we have demonstrated that introspection plans can be used to monitor the execution of such strategies. We expect that introspection plans could support other strategies such as reasoning about an issue from different perspectives <ref> (Oehlmann et al., 1994) </ref>. This paper focuses on metacognitive processes; future work has to address the representation of knowledge about metacognitive states and events in an integrated model (see Leake, 1995; Cox, 1995; Cox & Freed, 1994).

Reference-contexts: The answer indicates that an additional experiment modification has to be performed. However, the system has first to ensure that it understands the perturbed experiment. The understanding criterion is given by the ability to explain the experimental result in the context of the experimental setting <ref> (see Schank, 1986) </ref>. Question 9: Do I understand this behaviour? Answer 9: Yes the LAMP is ON, because there is a wire between the BATTERY and the LAMP and there is a CURRENT-FLOW through the LAMP.

Reference-contexts: The annotation is used as an index during future case retrieval. As a result, the prediction failure can be avoided in the future. This view of memory is referred to as failure driven memory <ref> (Schank, 1982) </ref>. Recent research in case-based reasoning has addressed the issue of guiding the reasoning process by introspection. Within this general area, research has mainly focused on the representation of knowledge about cognition. For example, Ram & Cox (1994) exploited the concept of failure driven memory.
