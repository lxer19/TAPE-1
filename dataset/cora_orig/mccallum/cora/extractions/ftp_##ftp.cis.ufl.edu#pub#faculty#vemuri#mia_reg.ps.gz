The modification involves precomputation of the Hessian matrix at the optimum without starting the iterative minimization process. <p> In the following, we will essentially adopt the notation from <ref> (Burkhardt and Diehl, 1986) </ref> to derive the modified Newton iteration and develop new notation as necessary. <p> The major advantage is a computational one, which stems from the fact that the Hessian is precomputed . In addition, the Modified Newton method has a broader range of convergence than the standard Newton scheme, as was shown in <ref> (Burkhardt and Diehl, 1986) </ref>. This allows the algorithm to cope with large motions even when the initial guess is far from the optimum. An example depicting the convergence range for the conventional Newton and Modified Newton scheme is shown in figure 4. <p> This allows the algorithm to cope with large motions even when the initial guess is far from the optimum. An example depicting the convergence range for the conventional Newton and Modified Newton scheme is shown in figure 4. Finally, the Modified Newton schemes is at least quadratically convergent <ref> (Burkhardt and Diehl, 1986) </ref>. 3.2 Application of the Modified Newton Method to the Local/Global Mo tion Model In this section, we describe a robust way of pre-computing the Hessian matrix at the optimum and the gradient vector at each iteration step for motion models including local and global ones. 3.2.1 H <p> Table 2 summarizes the relative errors for different affine motions. The computed motion results are shown for three different methods namely, the Levenberg-Marquardt method used in Szeliski et al., (Szeliski and Coughlan, 1994) for minimization of the spline-based representation SSD error and the modified Newton method of Burkhardt <ref> (Burkhardt and Diehl, 1986) </ref> for minimizing the expectation of the squared differences error and our method. This experimental study involved comparing the performance of our algorithm with the performance of our implementation of the published algorithms in Szeliski et al., (Szeliski and Coughlan, 1994) and Burkhardt (Burkhardt and Diehl, 1986). <p> Newton method of Burkhardt <ref> (Burkhardt and Diehl, 1986) </ref> for minimizing the expectation of the squared differences error and our method. This experimental study involved comparing the performance of our algorithm with the performance of our implementation of the published algorithms in Szeliski et al., (Szeliski and Coughlan, 1994) and Burkhardt (Burkhardt and Diehl, 1986). Our implementation of the algorithm in (Szeliski and Cough-lan, 1994) was able to reproduce their published results of estimated motion for public domain image data thereby lending credence to our implementation. Our method is a combination of these two methods and inherits their best features.

Reference-contexts: Bajscy and Kovacic (Bajscy and Kovacic, 1989) studied registration under nonrigid deformations using volumetric deformations based on elasticity theory of solids. Other direct approaches have used the so called "fluid registration" approach introduced by Christensen 4 et al. <ref> (Christensen el al., 1996) </ref>. In this approach the registration transformation is modeled by a viscous fluid flow model expressed as a partial differential equation (PDE).

Reference-contexts: The registration is performed in 2D yielding a stack of registered 2D coronal slices. Another direct approach is based on the concept of maximizing mutual information reported in Viola and Wells (Viola and Wells, 1995) and Wells et al., (Wells III et al., 1996), Collignon et al., <ref> (Collignon et al., 1995) </ref> and Studholme et al., (Studholme et al.,). <p> Mutual information between the model and the image that are to be registered is maximized using a stochastic analog of the gradient descent method in (Wells III et al., 1996) and other optimization methods such as the Powells method in <ref> (Collignon et al., 1995) </ref> and a multiresolution scheme in (Studholme et al.,). The primary computational task in the mutual information based techniques is the estimation of probability density functions and their derivatives from the given data sets.

Reference-contexts: The key difference in their scheme from earlier methods is the use of tensor product splines to represent different registration transformations, namely rigid, affine, trilinear, quadratic etc. In addition, they also introduced the novel concept of octree splines for very fast computation of distance between surfaces. Davatzikos et al. <ref> (Davatzikos and Prince, 1994) </ref> introduced a two stage brain image registration algorithm.

Reference-contexts: I 2 and I 1 denote the target and initial reference images, respectively. We use a combination of a 5 quasi-Newton and a modified Newton scheme. The quasi-Newton algorithms is well known in numerical analysis literature (Gill et al., 1981) and the modified Newton technique developed by Diehl <ref> (Diehl and Burkhardt, 1989) </ref> will be described in a subsequent section. <p> This precomputation of the Hessian leads to tremendous computational advantages and in addition, the convergence range of this modified Newton scheme is much larger than the standard Newton scheme (see <ref> (Diehl and Burkhardt, 1989) </ref> for details). When combined with the spline-based representation of the (u; v) field, the motion computation is very stable as is evident in the examples presented in this paper. <p> However, for a slightly different formulation, the Hessian for general motion can be precomputed. In the following, we will describe such a formulation. A clever technique was introduced in <ref> (Diehl and Burkhardt, 1989) </ref>, involving the use of innovations (incremental transformations) with a moving coordinate system fX k g and an intermediate motion vector ~ T to develop the formulas for precomputing the Hessian. <p> However, in the modified Newton scheme described earlier, we always used the zero vector as the initial guess for the motion vector to start the iterations. For more details on the convergence behavior of this method, we refer the reader to <ref> (Diehl and Burkhardt, 1989) </ref>. For visualization purpose, we apply the inverse of the computed transformation to the second image I 2 and then superimpose it on I 1 .

Reference-contexts: The primary computational task in the mutual information based techniques is the estimation of probability density functions and their derivatives from the given data sets. The density function estimation has typically been performed using the Parzen window approach <ref> (Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>. Derivatives of the entropy whose definition involves densities are required when maximizing mutual information between the data sets. Once the densities are estimated, derivatives of the empirical entropy are easily estimated. Reported registration experiments in these works are quite impressive for the case of rigid motion.

Reference-contexts: The minimization is carried out numerically 2 using Powell's method. Their measure of distance between surfaces is appropriate only for spherical shapes.

Reference-contexts: Reported registration experiments in these works are quite impressive for the case of rigid motion. Most mutual information based algorithms for image registration in literature have been formulated for global parameterized motion with the exception of the recent work reported in Meyer et al., <ref> (Meyer97, 1997) </ref> wherein affine transformations as well as thin-plate spline warps are handled. The reported registration results are quite impressive but the CPU execution times are quite high in the order of several hours for estimating thin-plate warps.

Reference-contexts: The specific preconditioning we use in our implementation of the local flow is a simple diagonal Hessian preconditioning. More sophisticated preconditioners can be used in place of this simple preconditioner and we refer the reader to <ref> (Lai and Vemuri, 1995) </ref> for more preconditioning. 19 3.2.2 H & g for 2D Rigid Flow We now derive the Hessian matrix and the gradient vector for the case when the flow field is expressed using a global parametric form specifically, rigid motion parameterization.

(Evans etl al., 1991) developed a registration scheme based on approximating the 3D warp between the model and target image by a 3D thin plate spline fitted to landmarks. Szeliski et al. <ref> (Szeliski and Coughlan, 1994) </ref> developed a fast matching algorithm for registration of 3D anatomical surfaces found in 3D medical image data. They use a distance metric minimization to find the optimal transformation between the surfaces. <p> The alternative class of registration algorithms involves using the direct approach, i.e., determining the registration transformation directly from the image data. One such straightforward approach is locally adaptive correlation window scheme (Okuomi and Kanade, 1992), which can achieve high accuracy. But it is computationally demanding <ref> (Szeliski and Cough-lan, 1994) </ref>. A more general scheme than window-based correlation approach is the optical 3 flow formulation, in which the problem of registering two images is treated as equivalent to computing the flow between the data sets. <p> i ; y i + v i ) = I 1 (x i ; y i ): (1) The problem of registering I 1 and I 2 is to recover the displacement field (u; v) for which the maximum likelihood solution is obtained by minimizing the error given by (see <ref> (Szeliski and Coughlan, 1994) </ref>) E ssd f (u i ; v i )g = i This formula is popularly known as the sum of squared differences (SSD) formula. <p> The decision to tile a region further is made based on the error in computed motion/registration. 7 2.1 2D Local Flow We represent the displacement fields u (x; y) and v (x; y) by B-splines with a small number of control points ^u j and ^v j as in Szeliski <ref> (Szeliski and Coughlan, 1994) </ref>. <p> Table 2 summarizes the relative errors for different affine motions. The computed motion results are shown for three different methods namely, the Levenberg-Marquardt method used in Szeliski et al., <ref> (Szeliski and Coughlan, 1994) </ref> for minimization of the spline-based representation SSD error and the modified Newton method of Burkhardt (Burkhardt and Diehl, 1986) for minimizing the expectation of the squared differences error and our method. <p> This experimental study involved comparing the performance of our algorithm with the performance of our implementation of the published algorithms in Szeliski et al., <ref> (Szeliski and Coughlan, 1994) </ref> and Burkhardt (Burkhardt and Diehl, 1986).
