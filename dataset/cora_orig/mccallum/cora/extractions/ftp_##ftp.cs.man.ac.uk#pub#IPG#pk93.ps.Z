Abstract: This paper contends that it is essential that Information Technology is designed to serve organ-isational goals, to fit comfortably within work patterns, and to enable rather than constrain change to these work patterns. To achieve this it is necessary to adopt a systemic approach to design whereby the relationship between all the components (people, work, support technologies) is understood. From this understanding there follows the opportunity to design technology systems which can do work and coordinate work between people in a fruitful way. This division between doing work and coordinating work, though crude, is a useful paradigm for revealing new roles of technology. Doing work (e.g. calculating invoice totals, providing performance figures) can be described as the established domain of IT. The coordination of work (i.e. who does what when) is a newer, evolving role for technology. Many new technologies support the coordination of work between people (e.g. process enactments, workow). A systemic approach to design can realise the benefits of these coordination technologies and har-monise their functionality with that of more traditional IT. Work processes are at the centre of attention of many industrialists and managers (evidenced by initiatives such as Total Quality Management and Business Process Redesign) as well as software engineers (evidenced by software process modelling). The Informatics Process Group (IPG) of the University of Manchester use the process as a framework around which the support technologies can be designed. The concept of process of encapsulates both the doing and the coordinating aspects of organisational behaviour. The IPG have carried out several case studies under full commercial conditions. Conclusions and lessons from some of these case studies are discussed. In particular it is noted that a much closer cooperation between the manager and the IT developer is being encouraged by the process perspective. The managers focus on process enables him/ her to look for benefits such as greater efficiency, increased product direction and empowered worker roles. The process designs can in part at least, (and especially for process enactments), provide a brief for the IT developer. Thus it is through an understanding of work processes that the relationship between technology and people can be explored. This implies a need for informative and precise process models. The IPG have, in conjunction with industrial partners, dedicated effort to developing process modelling methods and graphical notations. This has led to the development of the Process Modelling Cookbook, in collaboration with British Telecommunications plc, and the more recent Process Analysis and Design Method, (PADM) on behalf of the IOPT consortium. Some of the latest ideas are introduced.
