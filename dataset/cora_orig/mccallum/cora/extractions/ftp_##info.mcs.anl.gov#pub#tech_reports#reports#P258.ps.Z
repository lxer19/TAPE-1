Abstract: In this paper we describe a search algorithm that can be used to determine good lattices of order N when N = N L N R has two nontrivial integer factors. This algorithm is based on relationships between an integer lattice fl R of order N R and its various sublattices all of order N. Using this we have determined all the four dimensional good lattices of order 599 or less. Our list has 23 entries.
