Title: Randomness in Private Computations  
Author: Eyal Kushilevitz Yishay Mansour 
Date: February 4, 1998  
Abstract: We consider the amount of randomness used in private distributed computations. Specifically, we show how n players can compute the exclusive-or (xor) of n boolean inputs t-privately, using only O(t 2 log(n=t)) random bits (the best known upper bound is O(tn)). We accompany this result by a lower bound on the number of random bits required to carry out this task; we show that any protocol solving this problem requires at least t random bits (again, this significantly improves over the known lower bounds). For the upper bound, we show how, given m subsets of f1; : : :; ng, to construct in (deterministic) polynomial time a probability distribution of n random variables (i.e., a probability distribution over f0; 1g n ) such that (1) the parity of random-variables in each of these m subsets is 0 or 1 with equal probability; and (2) the support of the distribution is of size at most 2m. This construction generalizes previously considered types of sample spaces (such as k-wise independent spaces and Schulman's spaces [S92]). We believe that this construction is of independent interest and may have various applications.

A particular goal was to allow deran-domization; i.e., to completely eliminate the use of randomness. For some problems, the best known deterministic algorithms are randomized algorithm which are latter derandomized (see, e.g., [KM94a]). We consider the role of randomness in t-private protocols. <p> In such applications, we cannot completely eliminate the use of randomness while maintaining the secrecy so we are just interested in reducing the number of random bits used. For such applications, other constructions such as *-bias (uniform) sample spaces <ref> [NN90, AGHP90] </ref> are not useful, as they only guarantee that parities are "almost" balanced. <p> These are sets B f0; 1g n of size polynomial in n and 1=* such that, for every x 2 f0; 1g n (and in particular every T i ), Pr b2B (hx; bi = 1) is at least 1 2 *. These spaces were studied in <ref> [NN90, AGHP90] </ref>, which in particular proved that such spaces can be constructed in N C 1 . By a simple counting argument, for every collection of t vectors in f0; 1g n there exists b 2 B whose inner product with 1 2 * of the vectors gives 1.

Reference-contexts: Observe that if a space is immune to the sets of T then its projection on every H i is uniform. Again this is a standard fact (see, e.g., <ref> [AS92] </ref>); to see this, consider a set H i . When specifying the probability of the parity for each T H i , we essentially determine the Fourier transform of the distribution, hence we uniquely determine the probability distribution over H i .

Reference-contexts: The players are assumed to be honest but curious; namely, they all follow the prescribed protocol P but they could try to get additional information from the messages they receive during the execution of the protocol.

Next, we define the notion of privacy (we follow, e.g., <ref> [BGW88, CK89] </ref>). For a set of players T (sometimes called a coalition), denote by C T the communication seen by the players in T ; that is, all message the players in T receive during the execution of the protocol (excluding, for convenience, the output messages).

Reference-contexts: Protocols for the xor (exclusive-or) function (and more generally, protocols for the modular sum function) are basic building blocks in most private-protocols currently known. As a result (and due to its relative simplicity), the task of computing xor t-privately was the subject of previous research <ref> [FY92, CK92, KR94, BDPV95] </ref>. We investigate the amount of randomness required to compute the exclusive-or of n input bits t-privately. <p> The known upper bound uses O (tn) random bits. 2 Better upper bounds were known only for the case t = 1 (see [KR94]), in which a single random bit is sufficient. As for lower bounds, Blundo et. al. <ref> [BDPV95] </ref> proved that if t n c (for some constant c) then (n 2 ) random bits are required and if t (2 p then (n) bits are required. For smaller values of t it was only known that no deterministic protocol for this task exists.

Reference-contexts: a uniform space dlog 2 jSje random bits are enough, while for sampling in a non-uniform space we may need much more (depending on the actual values p s for s 2 S) 4 , and in some cases will not be able to create exactly the same distribution (see <ref> [KY76] </ref>). Sampling is needed if, for example, we do not want to pay the jSj penalty in the running-time involved with derandomizing an algorithm but we just want to run the algorithm once. In such a case a non-uniform space does not necessarily reduce the number of random bits required.

As a result (and due to its relative simplicity), the task of computing xor t-privately was the subject of previous research <ref> [FY92, CK92, KR94, BDPV95] </ref>. We investigate the amount of randomness required to compute the exclusive-or of n input bits t-privately. <p> We investigate the amount of randomness required to compute the exclusive-or of n input bits t-privately. The known upper bound uses O (tn) random bits. 2 Better upper bounds were known only for the case t = 1 (see <ref> [KR94] </ref>), in which a single random bit is sufficient. As for lower bounds, Blundo et. al. [BDPV95] proved that if t n c (for some constant c) then (n 2 ) random bits are required and if t (2 p then (n) bits are required. <p> Intuitively, in such a case, the protocol becomes deterministic. The impossibility result follows from the fact that there is no deterministic 1-private protocol for 3 or more parties (see <ref> [KR94] </ref>). To be more formal, consider the protocol for n (t 1) 3 players that is obtained by running P while giving each P i j input 0, and each P i (in this set and out of it) the corresponding coordinate of ~s. <p> We will construct a new protocol P 0 that computes xor for n s 3 players, P s+1 ; : : : ; P n , 1-privately and deterministically. It is well known that such a protocol does not exist (see <ref> [KR94] </ref>) and hence we will get the desired contradiction.
