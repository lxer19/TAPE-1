Title: 92 Hector: Connecting Words with Definitions

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, wordclasses can be identified automatically with a reasonable degree of accuracy. We adapted the algorithm described by Ken Church, and used the data from the Lancaster-Oslo 6 Bergen corpus (LOB), graciously provided to us in machine-readable form by Knut Hofland, to produce a wordclass tagger called Adam <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. Briefly, the LOB data tells us how often a word was assigned a particular wordclass and how often any combination of three wordclasses occurred in a row.

Reference-contexts: Hector was a feasibility study on high-tech corpus lexicography. The experience of the COBUILD Project at Collins and the University of Birmingham demonstrated that lexicographers need a corpus, a very large body of running text, to work on ordinary words <ref> [6, 2] </ref>. But at COBUILD the lexicographers looked at their corpus on paper and impressionistically; they spread paper concordances out on their kitchen tables, marked a few lines with colored pens, and threw them away.

Reference-contexts: We use Pat and modest home-made front ends in these commands. 3.5 Gritty Details The corpus viewer and the dictionary-entry editor are written in Modula-3 <ref> [4] </ref>. Their user-interface code uses the X Window System [5]. It is built on top of SRC's FormsVBT library, which is built in turn on top of SRC's Trestle and VBTkit. 6 The corpus viewer consists of approximately 15,000 lines of source code, the dictionary-entry editor of approximately 25,000.
