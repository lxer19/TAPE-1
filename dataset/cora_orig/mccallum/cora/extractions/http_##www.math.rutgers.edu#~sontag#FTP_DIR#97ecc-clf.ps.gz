Abstract: This paper shows that, for time varying systems, global asymptotic controllability to a given closed subset of the state space is equivalent to the existence of a continuous control-Lyapunov function with respect to the set.

Reference-contexts: This was proved by Artstein in <ref> [2] </ref>. But continuous feedback may fail to exist, even for very simple controllable systems (see e.g. [9], Section 4.8). Thus smooth clf's do not always exist, even if the system is asymptotically controllable. However, it was shown in [8] that continuous clf's do exist.

Reference-contexts: The clf approach, assuming a V has been found, allows the search for stabilizing inputs by iteratively solving a static nonlinear programming problem: when at state x, find u such that this inequality holds. Recent expositions of results about (smooth) clf's can be found in the textbooks <ref> [5] </ref> and [6]. An obvious question is whether the existence of a continuously differentiable clf is equivalent to the possibility of driving every state asymptotically to the set A (zero in this particular case).

Reference-contexts: with possibly non-compact sets A, many technical complications arise. (Of course, one must allow now for time-dependent V , and the definition of asymptotic controllability must be in some sense uniform on time, in order to obtain a necessary and sufficient result.) We also use some ideas from the paper <ref> [7] </ref>, which dealt with set stability but only for systems with no controls (which allows constructing smooth V 's). Definitions and Main Result We take U to be a locally compact metric space, with a distinguished "0" element. We denote U r = fu j d (u; 0) rg. <p> The proof, which we omit for reasons of space, consists of a routine argument involving comparison functions, and is patterned along the lines of the completely analogous result in <ref> [7] </ref>, Proposition 2.5. Lemma 1.2 Let A R n be a closed, weakly invariant, and nonempty set.

Reference-contexts: For instance, in this manner one may encompass problems of tracking, in which the difference between some variables and a signal to be followed evolves according to a differential equation which depends explicitly in t.
