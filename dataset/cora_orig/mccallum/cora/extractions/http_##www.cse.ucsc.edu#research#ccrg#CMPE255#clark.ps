Title: Adding Service Discrimination to the Internet  
Author: David D. Clark 
Date: September 1995, Version 2.0  
Affiliation: MIT Laboratory for Computer Science  
Abstract: This paper explores extensions to the Internet that can provide discrimination in the service offered to different users in times of network congestion. It proposed a scheme which allows different users to adjust their sending rates to different values during overload. This scheme is contrasted with a number of resource allocation schemes under consideration. 1

Reference-contexts: This cycle of increase and decrease, which serves to discover and utilize whatever bandwidth is available, continues so long as there is data to send. TCP, as currently specified and implemented, uses a set of algorithms named "slow start", and "fast retransmit" <ref> [Jacobson] </ref>, which together realize the rate adaptation aspect of the Internet. These rather sophisticated algorithms have been developed over the last several years, and seem to work fairly well in practice 2 . It is sometimes assumed that the consequence of congestion is increased delays.

Reference-contexts: Isolated measurements of delay across the Internet usually yield values in this range, whether the measurements are taken in periods of presumed high or low load. MacKie-Mason and Varian <ref> [MacKie] </ref> have measured variation of delay on a number of Internet links, and observed that in some cases maximum delay is indeed observed to increase under periods of higher loads, but that the average does not usually deviate markedly in most cases. <p> This leads to the idea of asserting the needed service level for each packet. One proposal for dynamic allocation of bandwidth at the packet level is the "smart market" proposal by MacKie-Mason and Varian <ref> [MacKie] </ref>. In this scheme, each packet carries a bid, a price that the user is willing to pay for service. <p> In that case, which users should be served? One approach, which binds price to service, would be to create a smart market along the lines of MacKie-Mason and Varian <ref> [MacKie] </ref>. Each packet could carry a bid for service, except in this case the bid is the highest price one will pay to avoid having a packet discarded and thus triggering a rate adjustment in one's TCP.

Reference-contexts: It is this characteristic of traffic that is described as bursty 4 . Analysis of actual traffic on parts of the Internet suggest that the bursty nature of traffic is very pronounced. One model for actual Internet traffic that has been proposed <ref> [Willinger] </ref> is the superposition of a number of on-off sources, where the distribution of on and off intervals is heavy-tailed, or has infinite variance. In general, the faster a packet network delivers a data object, the greater the user satisfaction.

Reference-contexts: In concrete terms, each TCP connection would thus represent a flow. It would be possible to build a packet switch which assured that each flow passing through it received an equal share. Methods to implement this, such as Weighted Fair Queuing <ref> [Demers, Clark] </ref>, are well known. But this sort of switch would only achieve local equality inside one switch. It would not really insure overall fairness, because it does not address how many flows each user has, and how they 6 The Frame Relay service is defined in this way.

Reference-contexts: This issue is explored in <ref> [Shenker] </ref>. 8 If there is no congestion, then there is presumably no queue of packets, which means that there is not a set of packets of different priority in the queue to reorder. Thus, priority scheduling normally has an effect only during congestion. 9 get much worse.

Reference-contexts: Priority scheduling - A scheme that has been proposed for allocation of bandwidth among users is to create service classes of different priorities to serve users with different needs. Such a scheme is proposed in <ref> [Gupta] </ref>. The definition of priority is that if packets of different priority arrive at a switch at the same time, the higher priority packets always depart first. This has the effect of shifting delay from the higher priority packets to the lower priority packets under congestion 8 .

Reference-contexts: None the less, there are several benefits to an approach based on a long term contract, rather than a highly dynamic scheme. A scheme based on log term contracts, called expected capacity pricing, is described in <ref> [Clark 95] </ref>. In this scheme, a user would purchase a usage profile, called an expected capacity profile, based on the general nature of his usage. For example, a user exploring the web would have need a very different profile from a scientist transferring a sequence of large data sets.
