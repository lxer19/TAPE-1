Reference-contexts: The hierarchy of event classes can be used to group kinds of events, such as all the movement events, so that they can be controlled and modified as a group. There are two standard ways to structure a simulator around events <ref> [3, p. 13] </ref>: event orientation Each event determines what subsequent events follow from it (that it "causes"). Thus, each event type would have a "successors" function of some kind. process orientation Each event is part of a process, and that process determines the subsequent events.
