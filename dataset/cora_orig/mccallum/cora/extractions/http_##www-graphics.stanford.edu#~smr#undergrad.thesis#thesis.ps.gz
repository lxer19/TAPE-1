Reference-contexts: Here we present some basic theory behind the physics of a Penning Trap, and the techniques used in this single-ion scheme. <ref> [Boyce, Brown & Gabrielse] </ref> 2.1 Theory The Penning trap consists of three electrodes, together forming a complete hyperboloid of revolution (Figure 2.1). The two endcaps are usually held at the same potential, which is generally above that of the ring (for a positive ion trap).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we must be careful to keep the ions in orbits of the same root-mean-squared radius, to avoid systematic errors due to field inhomogeneity.

Reference-contexts: Although the latter approach requires more computer time, it is conceptually more straightforward and does not require trade-offs in making certain approximations. Therefore, this is the method we choose in doing our simulations. Once we have ring modulation, we may test out the method proposed by Eric Cornell <ref> [Cornell 1992] </ref> for cooling the sum and difference modes separately. The recipe for cooling just the sum mode is the following: Adjust the DC ring voltage such that the average of the axial frequencies of the ions is equal to the coil frequency.
