Abstract: Cai and Selman [CS96] proposed a general definition of average computation time that, when applied to polynomials, results in a modification of Levin's [Lev86] notion of average-polynomial-time. The effect of the modification is to control the rate of convergence of the expressions that define average computation time. With this modification, they proved a hierarchy theorem for average-time complexity that is as tight as the Hartmanis-Stearns [HS65] hierarchy theorem for worst-case deterministic time. They also proved that under a fairly reasonable condition on distributions, called condition W, a distributional problem is solvable in average-polynomial-time under the modification exactly when it is solvable in average-polynomial-time under Levin's definition. Various notions of reductions, as defined by Levin [Lev86] and others, play a central role in the study of average-case complexity. However, the class of distributional problems that are solvable in average-polynomial-time under the modification is not closed under

Reference-contexts: Final Remark. This paper is a journal version of a conference paper of Belanger and Wang <ref> [BW96] </ref>. Pavan subsequently found a simpler proof of Theorem 2, which has the added advantage of using a reduction as simple as the identity function, rather than the more complicated reduction used in the original proof.

Reference-contexts: See section 2 for definition. 2 Levin's definitions concern only the distinction between polynomial on average and super-polynomial on average. Ben-David et al. <ref> [BCGL92] </ref> proposed a straightforward generalization and gave a definition of T on average for an arbitrary time bound T . <p> Lemma 1 1. Let (A; A ) and (B; B ) be two distributional problems such that (A; A ) p m (B; B ). If (B; B ) 2 AP, then (A; A ) 2 AP. 2. Polynomial-time many-one reductions are transitive. Other reductions <ref> [VL88, Gur91, BCGL92] </ref> between distributional problems have been defined and used to prove average-case completeness results. These reductions are weaker than p-time many-one reductions in that p-time reductions imply the other types of reductions. We will restrict our attention in this paper to p-time many-one reductions. <p> Since then, several other average-case NP-complete problems have been found. Levin's definition intends only to distinguish between "hard on average" and "easy on average" distributional problems. To make finer distinctions, Ben-David et al. <ref> [BCGL92] </ref> suggested a straightforward generalization and defined a function t to be T on average if t (x) = T (`(x)) for some linear on average function `. Letting T 1 (n) = minfm : T (m) ng, this can be rephrased as follows: Definition 3 ([BCGL92]) Let be a distribution

Reference-contexts: Under their definition, when a distribution puts most of the weight on a few instances, so the weights on the rest of the instances are negligible, a function larger than T everywhere could still be T on average. To avoid this, Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref> formulated a definition of T on average that requires, for every n, that the expectation over the set A n = fx : jxj ng, with respect to the conditional distribution over A n , be less than or equal to 1. <p> Such hierarchy results are bound to be weaker than Hartmanis-Stearns' hierarchy for worst-case deterministic time. On the other hand, it is possible to get a hierarchy theorem as strong as Hartmanis-Stearns' when restricted to certain types of polynomially bounded functions. In particular, Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref> showed the following result. Let t; T : IN ! IN be logarithmico-exponential functions 2 such that t is bounded above by a polynomial and T is fully time constructible. <p> Despite these restrictions, they include many standard functions. 6 However, as noted by Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref>, ADTime (4 n ) = ADTime (2 n ). <p> This gives rise naturally to the following definition of Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref>. Definition 4 Let be a distribution on fl , and let W n = (fx : jxj ng). Let T be a function from IN to IN. <p> Lemma 2 Suppose that (A; ) is solvable by a deterministic algorithm in time t such that for sufficiently large n, P jxjn T 1 (t (x))jxj 1 (x) W n . Then (A; ) 2 AVDTime (T (n)). The following result is an easy consequence of definition 4 <ref> [CS96] </ref>. Let T 1 ; T 2 be fully time constructible, and (A; ) a distributional decision problem. If A is in DTime (T 1 (n)), then (A; ) is in AVDTime (T 1 (n)).

Reference-contexts: More to the point of this paper, there are NP-hard problems whose expected running time is polynomial. For example, the Hamiltonian path problem can be solved in expected linear time under commonly used distributions on random graphs <ref> [GS87] </ref>. A distributional problem is a decision problem paired with a probability distribution on instances. Given a distributional problem, it is an important issue to either find an expected polynomial-time algorithm that solves the problem or prove that such an algorithm does not exist.

Reference-contexts: A distributional problem is a decision problem paired with a probability distribution on instances. Given a distributional problem, it is an important issue to either find an expected polynomial-time algorithm that solves the problem or prove that such an algorithm does not exist. Levin <ref> [Lev86] </ref> provided two central notions for studying this issue. One is analogous to the class P, and provides an easiness notion; the other is analogous to the class of NP-complete sets, and provides a hardness notion. <p> Let denote a probability distribution (distribution, in short) over fl , i.e., for all x, (x) 0 and x (x) = 1. Its distribution function fl (x) = P cumulative distribution of up to x, where is the standard lexicographical order. The following definitions are due to Levin <ref> [Lev86] </ref>. A function ` is linear on -average if the expected value of `(x)=jxj with respect to is bounded, i.e. if P x `(x)jxj 1 (x) &lt; 1. A function t is polynomial on - average if t is a polynomial of a linear on -average function. <p> Then t is polynomial on -average if there exists a positive integer k such that P Several authors have explained the motivations and justifications of this definition, and have explained why seemingly more obvious formulations fail <ref> [Lev86, Gur89, Gur91, Ven91, Imp95, Wan96] </ref>. Let AP denote the class of all distributional decision problems (A; ) such that A can be solved by a deterministic algorithm whose running time is polynomial on -average. Let and betwo distributions. <p> Then, we say that A is 4 dominated by B with respect to f , denoted by A f B , if there exists a distribution such that A and for all y 2 range (f ), B (y) = f (-)(y). Levin <ref> [Lev86] </ref> first defined polynomial-time many-one reducibility, we will use the form given by Gurevich [Gur91]. In what it follows, we will use "p-time" to denote "polynomial-time". Definition 2 Let (A; A ) and (B; B ) be two distributional problems. <p> A distributional problem is average case many-one complete for NP if it is in DistNP and every other problem in 5 DistNP is p m -reducible to it. In this case, we will say, more simply, that the problem is average-case NP-complete. Levin <ref> [Lev86] </ref> showed that a distributional tiling problem with a simple distribution on instances is average-case NP-complete. Since then, several other average-case NP-complete problems have been found. Levin's definition intends only to distinguish between "hard on average" and "easy on average" distributional problems.
