Abstract: Self-reconfigurable robots are robots composed of many physically connected modules which can change their structural configuration to support multiple functionalities. The modules may be complete robots in themselves capable of performing some tasks without cooperation, or they may be units which are functional only when some minimum number of modules are present. Modules create structures by attaching themselves to static objects or to each other. We claim that self-reconfigurable robots are more versatile, extensible, and reliable than conventional fixed-architecture robots. In this thesis proposal we describe two different self-reconfigurable robot systems. One system is based on the Inchworm robot, a small mobile robot which can perform independent navigation and manipulation tasks and can also cooperate to create structures with expanded functionality. The second system is based on our recently developed Molecule robot. Molecules are simple robots which cannot act as independent units but can cooperate to form three-dimensional structures which can move using self-reconfiguration. We discuss the scientific challenges of these systems, present a proposal for future thesis work, and describe the current status of our research.

Reference-contexts: Previous work on cooperative manipulation has focused on pushing. Cooperative pushing has been treated in the context of box-pushing with multiple robots. In [Par94] a reinforcement learning strategy that focuses on task allocation is presented. 9 Combining cooperation with mobile robot manipulation are, e.g., [Nor93], [Par94], [Yam94], [BHD94], and <ref> [BK95] </ref>. <p> and applies that architecture to a number of tasks (mostly in simulation), including "hazardous waste cleanup", in which several mobots cooperate to pick up a number of small objects and move them near a designated site. [BHD94] treats successfully a foraging task 2 in which multiple robots cooperate without communication. <ref> [BK95] </ref> discusses communication in distributed systems of robots. Our previous work builds on the ground-breaking work of [Mas86, Erd93, EM86, Don95] and focuses on developing near-sensorless (i.e., that require only sparse sensing) manipulation protocols [Rus92, JR93, DJR93, DJR94a, RDJ95, DJR96a, DJR96b, Rus96].

Reference-contexts: Much of the groundbreaking research in self-reconfigurable robots can be found in <ref> [PC+96, PEC97, CPE96] </ref>. [PC+96] describes metamorphic robots that can aggregate as stationary two-dimensional structures with varying geometry and implement planar locomotion. Two different module designs are described, a deformable hexagon module and a non-deformable square module. These modules are used separately to create different planar lattice structures which exhibit self-reconfiguration. <p> An optimal assignment metric is presented which can be represented as a perfect matching in a weighted bipartite graph, with running time O (n 3 ), where n is the number of modules. The various metrics are used with the method of Simulated Annealing to demonstrate metric effectiveness. In <ref> [CPE96] </ref> the kinematic constraints governing metamorphic robot self-reconfiguration are addressed, and lower and upper bounds are established for the minimal number of moves needed to reconfigure from any initial configuration to any final configuration.

[Yim93, Yim94a, Yim94b] studies multiple modes of loco 8 motion that are achieved by composing a few basic elements in different ways. The modules can be assembled by hand in multiple ways and the resulting structures support several locomotion modalities.

Reference-contexts: A set of such basic motions can be used to develop cooperative algorithms without starting from scratch. Remote-brained control vs. on-board control In a remote-brained robot the "intelligence" of the robot does not exist on the robot itself, but in one or more remote computers <ref> [Ina93] </ref>. There are many advantages to such a system, including ease of programming and the ability to utilize more compute power than the robot could physically hold. Most small robots use a microcontroller or an embedded microprocessor to supervise the robot's activities. <p> Higher-level control is performed 23 by a remote workstation which communicates with the microcontroller via a 38.4k baud serial link. This gives the Inchworm the properties of a remote-brained system, as outlined in <ref> [Ina93] </ref>. The Inchworm is powered by an external power supply, either lead-acid batteries or an AC power supply. Batteries cannot be located on the body of the Inchworm due to weight constraints. This means that the Inchworm must be connected to the power source with a tether. <p> The microprocessor performs low-level control of the hardware but the high-level control of the Molecule takes place off-board in a workstation. The Molecule communicates with the workstation using an RS-485 serial connection. This is an example of a remote brained robot system <ref> [Ina93] </ref>. In a remote brained system the majority of the processing power of the robot is performed off-board in a workstation. There are several advantages to remote brained systems, including ease of code development and the ability to utilize more processing power than could be physically placed on the robot.

Nishi <ref> [Nis92] </ref> describes a biped walking robot configured as a pendulum that uses a suction device for attachment and is capable of linear motions and surface transitions. <p> Our robot is different than the previous climbing robots in that it is much smaller, lighter, it needs less workspace to operate and it can handle web structures, as well as solid walls. However, our robot requires a ferrous surface while the robots proposed in <ref> [Nis92, HNT91] </ref> use suction cups and thus do not have this dependency. Moreover, the robots [Nis92, HNT91] depend on smooth surfaces, while ours can handle porous surfaces. 2.4 Cooperative and distributed robot systems There has been a great deal of work on cooperative systems of robots. <p> However, our robot requires a ferrous surface while the robots proposed in <ref> [Nis92, HNT91] </ref> use suction cups and thus do not have this dependency.

Reference-contexts: Inchworm caterpillars (also called loopers) move with a looping movement in which the anterior legs and posterior prolegs are alternately made fast and released <ref> [Opl94] </ref>. The strong grip of the legs and prolegs allows inchworms to attach themselves 13 to arbitrarily oriented objects. The alternation of fastening enables a propelling motion. This simple strategy gives inchworms the mobility to move stably on arbitrarily oriented surfaces. The inchworm caterpillar model was chosen for two reasons.

Two different module designs are described, a deformable hexagon module and a non-deformable square module. These modules are used separately to create different planar lattice structures which exhibit self-reconfiguration. <p> Hexagonal modules move by deforming their shape. The square module has a fixed shape and uses a shuttle mechanism as a connector and as a means to move one module with respect to another. Square modules slide along each other's faces to reconfigure their shape. <ref> [PEC97] </ref> formalizes the motion planning/reconfiguration problem for metamorphic robots and examines several metrics for defining the "distance" between configurations. <p> One approach to accomplish this is to find a matching of Molecules from one structure to Molecules in another structure as in <ref> [PEC97] </ref>. Such a matching should minimize the total amount of Molecule movement needed to reconfigure as the new structure. In some cases, Molecules may need assistance from other Molecules to move to their intended location. <p> Note that the Molecule configuration planning problem is more difficult than that in <ref> [PEC97] </ref> because Molecules do not create fully-packed lattices 10 . Trajectory planning determines if a Molecule can reach a desired location and, if so, generates the sequence of motions needed to move the Molecule to the location.

Reference-contexts: The modules can be assembled by hand in multiple ways and the resulting structures support several locomotion modalities. A pilot study consisting of a small set of modules was built; much of the locomotion and reconfiguration control was done in simulation. The physical modules have no on-board processing. In <ref> [PK95] </ref> a method for designing various robotic arms with different reachability properties out of the same set of 7 modules is proposed. The mechanical design algorithm is implemented as simulated annealing that starts with a random mechanical design and converges to the design with desired reachability properties.

In this system a set of modules achieves planar reconfigurability by exploiting changes in the polarity of magnetic fields. <p> The reconfiguration motion is actuated by varying the polarity of a electromagnets that are embedded in each module to either attract or repel neighboring modules. In addition to the module design, significant work has been done on distributed module control and fault tolerance. <ref> [YM+97] </ref> discusses distributed formation control of a set of units. Reconfiguration is driven by a diffusion process in which units which are farther from their goal positions have a higher move "priority" than units which are close to their goal positions.
