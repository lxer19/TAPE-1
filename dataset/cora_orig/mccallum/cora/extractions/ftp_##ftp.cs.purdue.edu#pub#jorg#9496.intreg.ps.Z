Title: Interpolation Regions for Convex Cubic Curve Segments  
Author: Jorg Peters 
Abstract: Given a family of planar convex cubic curve segments with fixed end points and tangents, subregions of the plane are characterized in which additional points can be interpolated by at least one member of the family. The region for a second additional point is a remarkably thin double crescent. Taking the freedom of (re)parametrization into account, 2d points in general position are required to pin down a real-valued, planar polynomial curve of parametric degree d: each point implies two constraints but offers the choice of one parameter value at which the curve interpolates. Two degrees of freedom have to be subtracted, since curve and degree are invariant under linear reparametrization. Conversely however, given 2d data points in the plane there may not exist an interpolating polynomial curve nor, if it exists, does it follow that the curve is unique. Whether it exists and exists uniquely, depends on the relative position of the points. For example, a parabolic arc is uniquely specified by four points in general position (to be compared to three for a quadratic function and five for a conic). The question as to where the points have to lie with respect to one another poses a nonlinear problem both in parametric and implicit representation. In the parametric representation both (re)parametrization and coefficients of the curve are unknown while in the implicit representation additional nonlinear restrictions are necessary to ensure that the curve segment is real valued and consists of just one component. As a second motivation, de Boor, Hollig, and Sabin [1] (see also the conjecture in [2]) show that a single cubic curve segment can usually but not always match six data: location, tangent direction and curvature at the end points. This is the limiting case of the study in this paper as two intermediate interpolation points approach the end points whose location and tangent direction is fixed. Given that order O(h 6 ) approximation in [1] works for a large range of data, it is remarkable how small the convex-interpolation region for the second of two intermediate points turns out to be. Thirdly, given the frequent use of quadratic and cubic curve segments in geometric modeling, understanding their basic interpolation properties is fundamental. Applications arise for example from the need of constraint solvers to completely characterize the space of all solutions to a given set of constraints on x1. Motivation and Approach
