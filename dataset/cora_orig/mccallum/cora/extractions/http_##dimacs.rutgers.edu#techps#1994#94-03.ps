Choose n j &gt; m j1 such that r 0 for all n n j . <p> Let R l (n; m) represent the number of representations of n and m that overlap in l numbers. (Note that l 2 <ref> [1; k 1] </ref>.) Further, let R fl l (n; m) represent a maximal collection of "disjoint overlaps" each overlapping pair of representations for n and m is disjoint from the other overlapping pairs.

Reference-contexts: All bases considered in this paper will be either asymptotic or strict asymptotic bases of order k. Erd-os and Tetali <ref> [7] </ref> gave a probabilistic construction of a strict asymptotic basis S of order k whose representation function satisfies log n &lt;< r 0 S (n) &lt;< log n. <p> First, we give a simple set of criteria under which an asymptotic basis (resp. strict asymptotic basis) contains a minimal asymptotic basis (resp. strict asymptotic basis). These criteria also enable us to construct @ 0 -minimal bases. Second, we show that the strict asymptotic basis S constructed in <ref> [7] </ref> satisfies this set of criteria and so contains a minimal as well as an @ 0 -minimal asymptotic basis. These results answer two important questions posed in [4]. Notation. <p> This completes the proof. - 10 - 3 Independence of solution sets Let S be the asymptotic basis constructed in <ref> [7] </ref>. In this section we want to prove that S satisfies the conditions of Theorems 1 and 2. That is, we prove the following theorem. <p> We first prove, in Lemma 1 below, that it suffices to verify that S satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 2. The first criterion of the hypothesis of Theorem 2 is satisfied by S, since r 0 S (n) = fi (log n), which is the main result of <ref> [7] </ref>. Lemmas 2 and 3 in the following show that the asymptotic basis S does in fact satisfy the rest of the hypothesis of Theorem 2. (In short, Lemmas 1,2, and 3 below constitute the proof of this theorem.) 2 Suppose that S satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 2. <p> Equivalently, we want to show for each m, the number of representations ( denoted r 0 l (m)) as a sum of l distinct elements from S is bounded. By Lemma 10 of <ref> [7] </ref>, we know that the number of representations of n as a sum of l distinct elements is bounded for l &lt; k. <p> Note that r 0 S (n; a) = the number of representations (in S) of (n a) as a sum of k 1 terms. Once again this follows from Lemma 10 of <ref> [7] </ref>. Finally, the following lemma proves that S meets the third criterion in Theorem 2. Lemma 3 jS 0 S (m) " S 0 S (n)j is bounded for all m &lt; n: Before we prove Lemma 3, we need a couple of technical lemmas. <p> Lemma 3 jS 0 S (m) " S 0 S (n)j is bounded for all m &lt; n: Before we prove Lemma 3, we need a couple of technical lemmas. The idea is going to be similar to that of the proof of Lemma 10 of <ref> [7] </ref> we first estimate the expected such number, and then bound the disjoint occurences. <p> We are going to show that n l 2k +o (1) by making use of the following estimates for l (n) from <ref> [7] </ref> (Lemma 8, page 252): l (n) n 1+l=k+o (1) ; for 2 l (k 1): - 12 - For technical reasons, fix " = l 4k . <p> R fl (m; n) &lt; c fl for all m &lt; n. Proof. (i) We use the disjointness lemma from <ref> [7] </ref> to prove the first part; thus Pr [R fl (m; n) &gt; 8k] &lt; 8k &lt; (8k)! n l 8k &lt; n 4+o (1) ; since l 1: (ii) Let A mn denote the event that R fl (m; n) &gt; 8k. <p> Then the first part of this lemma implies that Pr [A mn ] &lt; n 4+o (1) . There are at most n 2 pairs (m; n) such that m &lt; n, and since n 2 Pr [A (m; n)] &lt; 1, by the Borel-Cantelli lemma (see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>), this implies that - 15 - a.a 9n fl s.t. R fl (m; n) &lt; 8k for all m &lt; n, whenever n &gt; n fl . <p> Thus each equivalence class is also bounded, and hence jS 0 S (m) " S 0 S (n)j is bounded. 2 4 Conclusions Theorems 1 and 2 along with Lemmas 1, 2, and 3 imply that the asymptotic basis constructed in <ref> [7] </ref> contains a minimal (strict) and an @ 0 -minimal (strict) asymptotic basis. Erd-os and Nathanson [3] obtained the following very simple criterion for an asymptotic basis A of order 2 to contain a minimal asymptotic basis.
