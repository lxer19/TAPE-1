Abstract: The "Steiner minimal tree" (SMT) of a point set P is the shortest network of "wires" which will suffice to "electrically" interconnect P . The "minimum spanning tree" (MST) is the shortest such network when only intersite line segments are permitted. The "Steiner ratio" (P ) of a point set P is the length of its SMT divided by the length of its MST. It is of interest to understand which point set (or point sets) in R d have minimal Steiner ratio. In this paper, we introduce a point set in R d which we call the "d-dimensional sausage." The 1 and 2-dimensional sausages have minimal Steiner ratios 1 and spectively. (The 2-sausage is the vertex set of an infinite strip of abutting equilateral triangles. The 3- sausage is an infinite number of points evenly spaced along a certain helix.) We present extensive heuristic evidence to support the conjecture that the 3-sausage also has minimal Steiner ratio ( 0:784190373377122). Also: We prove that the regular tetrahedron minimizes among 4-point sets to at least 12 decimal places of accuracy. This is a companion paper to D-Z. Du and W.D.Smith: Three disproofs of the Gilbert-Pollak Steiner ratio conjecture in three or more dimensions, submitted Journal of Combinatorial Theory. We have tried to devote this paper more to 3D and the other paper more to general dimension, but the split is not clean. p

Reference-contexts: For each d 3, at present d is not known. (The conjecture of Gilbert and Pollak that d was achieved when P was the d + 1 vertices of a regular d-simplex, has been shown <ref> [22] </ref> to be false for each d 3.) The purpose of this paper is to present a point set we call the d-dimensional sausage. The d-sausage achieves d when d = 1 and d = 2. <p> The d-sausage is in fact the current record holder (minimal known - value) in every dimension d. (Some bounds on d that arise from the d-sausage were tabulated in <ref> [22] </ref>.) In particular (2) is the best known upper bound on 3 . How- ever, we advise caution for these two reasons: 1. <p> We have not subjected any dimension d 4 to the sort of scrutiny (which we will report on in this paper) that we have when d = 3.

There is an argument <ref> [22] </ref> which makes it plausible that the d-sausage may not have minimal in all sufficiently large dimensions d. In particular, if the d- sausage is non-minimal in any dimension d, it probably is non-minimal for every d 15.

We've already defined "Steiner ratio" our (and other people's) results on it; in particular our Main Conjecture that the 3-sausage is the point set with minimal Steiner ratio. <p> This topology was called the "path topology" in <ref> [22] </ref>, since the Steiner points fall on a single path. <p> This is a consequence of the fact that the N -point (d 1)-sausage can be mapped onto the N -point d-sausage by "folding" (d 1)-space inside of d- space, much as you would fold a sheet of paper to make a 3-dimensional shape. The full proof was given in <ref> [22] </ref>. 2 An immediate, and surprising, consequence of conjectures 2 and 3 would be Conjecture 6 (The worst sets are infinite) No finite point set in R 3 has minimal . <p> Hwang.]) The assumption of conjecture 4 forces one, as was described in <ref> [22] </ref>, to the conclusion that the 3-sausage's SMT must have the same symmetry group as the 3- sausage itself and must be "periodic" with the "unit cell" being the regular tetrahedron formed of any 4 consecutively numbered sausage points. A computation within this unit cell [22] (see also x10.2 of the <p> one, as was described in <ref> [22] </ref>, to the conclusion that the 3-sausage's SMT must have the same symmetry group as the 3- sausage itself and must be "periodic" with the "unit cell" being the regular tetrahedron formed of any 4 consecutively numbered sausage points. A computation within this unit cell [22] (see also x10.2 of the present paper) then leads to the conclusion (subject to conjecture 4) that the 3-sausage has Steiner ratio 0:784190. <p> Re- gardless of the truth of conjecture 4, this is still a valid upper bound on the 3-sausage's -value, and hence on 3 . (Upper bounds on d derived from the d-sausages for some other values of d, may be found in <ref> [22] </ref>.) This is an algebraic number, and indeed any assumption of periodicity must always lead to an algebraic number 3 . We will describe how we found the closed form (2) in x10.2. 7 Summary of the evidence I. <p> (or putative Steiner ratios) of thousands of interesting N -point subsets of R 3 , 3 It is also possible to write a closed form expression for (4sausage), using only rational operations and radicals, again assuming that the path-topology is correct. (Apply the quartic formula and see a footnote in <ref> [22] </ref>.) In dimensions higher than 4, though, we doubt any such closed forms are possible. We also suspect that the algebraic degree of d grows unboundedly. <p> One obtains a contradiction.) 2 Theorem 11 is in fact a special case of "Du's packing principle" given in <ref> [22] </ref>. 9 The Du-Hwang minimax lemma meets 3D; The regular tetrahedron is the 4-point set with minimal The useful "Du-Hwang minimax lemma" is as follows. (It is theorem 3.1 of [19]. <p> In all cases mentioned, the value given arose from the "path topology" described in conjecture 4. 10.2 The (putative) value for the infinite 3-sausage Let denote the Steiner ratio of the 3-sausage, subject to the path-topology assumption of conjecture 4. In <ref> [22] </ref>, it was described how to find for the d-sausage (subject to essentially the same topology-assumption) by solving a certain (d 1)-dimensional concave-up minimization problem. <p> Regardless of the truth of conjecture 4, the expression on the right hand side of (2) is a valid upper bound on the Steiner ratio of the 3-sausage, and on 3 . 10.3 The sausage seems to be correctly designed locally The reader will recall from <ref> [22] </ref> that the sausage was "designed" to bring as far as possible below the value achieved by the regular simplex.

(They arise from the regular tetrahedron. See <ref> [36] </ref>, for example.) Put four copies of P inside cones of diametric angle 49:47 ffi and common apex coaxially centered in these 4 cones. The resulting set P 4 (which has cardinality 4jP j 3) has a Steiner ratio (P 4 ) (P ).

Reference-contexts: Remark 9 This is interesting because the Rubinstein- Thomas theorem <ref> [37] </ref> states that the SMT of n-gons in the plane whose vertices all lie on a circle and at most one of whose edges is longer than the circle's radius, is always the same as the MST.

Unfortunately it is NP-hard to find the shortest Steiner tree (SMT) of a point set, even in the Euclidean plane [23]. The best known algorithms are discussed in [43] and [14]. One therefore is forced to either use an exponentially large amount of computer time, prove P = N P , 1 or else settle for an interconnecting network whose length may not be absolutely minimal but which may be found in polynomial time. <p> We have shown that when d = 3 and N = 3 : : : 13, conjectures 3 and 4 are true. (Proof: brute force computer computation of the SMTs of the ( 13)-point 3-sausages using the computer program given in <ref> [43] </ref>. See table 1.) A related monotonicity statement which we have been able to prove, is Fact 5 The N -point d-sausage has a smaller -value than the N -point (d 1)-sausage if N &gt; d 3. Proof Sketch. <p> Point sets with a lot of symmetries and/or a lot of regular simplices are therefore plausible candidates. 10 A Plethora of point sets & their Steiner ratios 10.1 The values for the N -point 3-sausages By brute force computation using the computer program given in <ref> [43] </ref>, we found the following values for the N - point 3-sausages. All values should be accurate to unit last place. <p> The piece of the SMT inside this unit cell is simply the SMT of a triangle, whose three vertices are (u; v; w; 0), (0; u; v; w), and (0; 0; 1; 0) and whose sides are a; b; c. The formula (3) arises from formula (2) of <ref> [43] </ref>. Since v = 1 u w, the minimization problem is really only 2-dimensional. At and near the minimum (one sees by numerical investigation) ` is irrelevant, Q is bounded above 0, and hence 2 is an analytic function of u; w in a neighborhood of this minimum. <p> Knowledge of the 3-sausage's helical tetrahedronal- chain configuration should be useful in the design of heuristics for the general 3D SMT problem [41]. 12 Corrections to W.D.Smith: How to find SMTs...
