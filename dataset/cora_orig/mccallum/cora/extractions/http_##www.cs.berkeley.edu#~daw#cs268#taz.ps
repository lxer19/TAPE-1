Title: TAZ Servers and the Rewebber Network Enabling Anonymous Publishing on the World Wide Web  
Author: Ian Goldberg and David Wagner

Abstract: The World Wide Web has recently matured enough to provide everyday users with an extremely cheap publishing mechanism. However, the current WWW architecture makes it fundamentally difficult to provide content without identifying yourself. We examine the problem of anonymous publication on the WWW, propose a design suitable for practical deployment, and describe our implementation. Some key features of our design include universal accessibility by pre-existing clients, short persistent names, security against social, legal, and political pressure, protection against abuse, and good performance.

Reference-contexts: However, it appears that very large benefits may potentially be available, especially if caching is combined with a special highsecurity mechanism using considerable re-ordering and random delays for non-interactive prefetching to warm the caches. Another improvement to the rewebber system would take advantage of steganography <ref> [1] </ref> to hide the fact that a particular author has published some (unspe-cified) works anonymously.

Reference-contexts: This issue is addressed further in Section 7. 6 Related Work Ross Anderson proposes the Eternity Service <ref> [2] </ref>, which is intended to provide very long-term digital storage and publication. It is intended to offer strong availability guarantees even in presence of adversarial attacks.

Reference-contexts: The technology for email anonymity took a step forward with the introduction of anonymous remailers. An anonymous remailer can be thought of as a mail server which combines the previous two techniques, but using a computer to automate the header-stripping and resending process <ref> [3, 11, 14, 18] </ref>. There are basically three styles of remailers; we classify remailer technology into "types" which indicate the level of sophistication and security. The anon.penet.fi ("type 0") remailer was perhaps the most famous. It supported anonymous email senders by stripping identifying headers from outbound remailed messages.

Reference-contexts: We therefore create a virtual namespace called the .taz namespace, and we create new servers called TAZ servers to resolve this namespace. TAZ stands for Temporary Autonomous Zone <ref> [4] </ref>; the emphasis here is that .taz sites can relocate quickly, utilizing the level of indirection offered by the TAZ server.

Reference-contexts: The newest and most sophisticated remailer technology is the Mixmaster, or type II, remailer <ref> [5, 7] </ref>. They extend the techniques used in a type I remailer to provide enhanced protection against eavesdropping attacks. First, one always uses chaining and encryption at each link of the chain.

Reference-contexts: We can identify a number of goals for a potential anonymous WWW publishing infrastructure. First, we should be clear that we only concern ourselves with the problem of anonymity for the publisher. In contrast, some existing services, such as the Anonymizer proxy <ref> [6] </ref>, aim to provide privacy for the user who is viewing WWW pages; we explicitly do not attempt to solve that problem. <p> The "strip identifying headers and resend" approach used by remailers has recently been applied to provide anonymity protection for Web browsing as well. Community ConneXion has sponsored the Anonym-izer <ref> [6] </ref>, an HTTP proxy that filters out identifying headers and source addresses from the WWW browser. This allowing users to surf the WWW anonymously without revealing their identity to WWW servers.

Reference-contexts: However, the Anonymizer offers rather weak security|no chaining, encryption, log safeguarding, or forward secrecy|so its security properties are roughly analogous to those of type 0 remailers. Other implementations have since appeared based on the same approach <ref> [8, 10] </ref>. 5 The Problem at Hand We now turn our attention to adapting the abovementioned technologies to the problem of anonymous WWW publishing.

Reference-contexts: One important lesson to take away from these efforts is that there are a great deal many clever and powerful attacks against low-latency anonymized traffic when adversaries have control over many segments of the network. Wei Dai's PipeNet architecture <ref> [9] </ref> is based on a distributed network of packet forwarders, connected by long-term encrypted communications links that are padded to constant bandwidth when not in use to prevent traffic analysis; Chaumian mixes are used at each router node.

Reference: [12] <author> Armando Fox et al., </author> <title> "Scalable Network Services," </title> <note> Submitted under blind review, </note> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: To thwart this, we always add random padding to the end of encrypted documents so that their total length is one of a handful of fixed sizes. We chose sizes of 10000, 20000, 40000, 80000, etc. bytes, as data in <ref> [12] </ref> indicate that the median size of files on the WWW is a little below 10000 bytes. We do not use latency-intensive techniques such as full Chaumian mixes, message reordering, or injecting random delays; interactive WWW browsing is too delay-sensitive to allow those techniques. <p> Therefore, a clever choice of rewebber chain would tend to include rewebbers being run by different people, preferably in different countries. 5.1.3 Implementation We implemented a rewebber on top of the scalable TACC server architecture described in <ref> [12] </ref>. This architecture provided us with a high-performance scalable HTTP proxy and caching system, on top of which it was straightforward to implement the extra functionality necessary for a rewebber. <p> We have completed a prototype implementation, and we expect to start deploying more mature code for practical use this summer. Implementation was eased by using the scalable TACC server architecture <ref> [12] </ref>. Extensibility is provided by separating the naming and document location problem from the core document anonymization services. One novel contribution was the observation that caching can be used to improve not just performance but also improve security against network eavesdroppers as well.

Reference-contexts: The anonymity services ought to be transparent to the browser software and WWW page reader. In short, enabling widespread deployment and use of this infrastructure is a central goal of this work. 4 Existing Technology In this section, we describe some existing privacy-enhancing technologies for the Internet <ref> [13] </ref>, in order to see what parts of the solutions they offer can be carried over to the problem of protecting the identity of WWW publishers.

Reference-contexts: Due to its simplicity and relatively simple user interface, the anon.penet.fi remailer was the most widely used remailer; sadly, it was shut down recently after being harassed by legal pressure <ref> [15] </ref>. The disadvantage of a anon.penet.fi style (type 0) remailer is that it provides rather weak security. Users must trust it not to reveal their identity when they send email through it.

Reference-contexts: With the increasing sophistication in remailer technology, we find that modern remailers have been burdened with a correspondingly complicated and ob-5 scure interface. To deal with this unfriendly mess, client programs have sprung up to provide a nicer interface to the remailers. Raph Levien's premail <ref> [16] </ref> is the archetypical example. Even so, using remailers still requires some knowledge; for even greater user-friendliness, we need this support to be integrated into popular mail handling applications.

Reference-contexts: from person to person in the Soviet Union, in a process known as samizdat (which is Russian for "self-publishing"); and when the Serbian government began jamming the Belgrade independent radio station during the Serb-Croat war, Serbian students used the World Wide Web to mirror broadcasts and combat the government's censorship <ref> [17, 23, 24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if the document is accessed directly (through a search engine, for example), it will be random data (but see Section 7 for an interesting extension). The encryption used here ought not be public-key; it should be a symmetric-key algorithm. (We used DESX <ref> [19] </ref> in our implementation, but any strong symmetric-key algorithm would do.

Reference-contexts: A more recent and mature research effort to build a practical infrastructure for interactive anonymous Internet traffic is the Onion Routing project <ref> [20] </ref>. The Onion Routing proposal embodies slightly more practically-oriented engineering decisions than vanilla 11 PipeNet. For instance, links are not padded to constant bandwidth; instead, Chaumian mixes and "safety in numbers" is used to protect against traffic analysis.

Reference-contexts: URNs (Universal Resource Names) <ref> [21] </ref> attempt to address nearly the same naming problem as TAZ servers do. Both attempt to provide short persistent names for resources via a simple resolving mechanisms, using the standard computer science trick| a level of indirection.

Reference-contexts: In such a future, we would be very glad that the security of our system does not rely on the security of the TAZ servers. We are not overly concerned with the authenticity of the TAZ database, because the best solution is to rely on end-to-end authentication <ref> [22] </ref>. Anonymous publishers concerned about forgeries should establish a public key for their pseudonym, sign all anonymous documents with this key, and distribute their nym's public key widely along with their .taz hostname.
