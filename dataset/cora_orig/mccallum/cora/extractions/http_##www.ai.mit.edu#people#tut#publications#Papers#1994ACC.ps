Abstract: The performance of many flexible systems can be improved by employing command shaping techniques to reduce ma - chine vibration. The input shaping technique, in particular, has proven to be highly effective for a wide class of systems. Unfortunately, due to the mathematical complexity of higher-order problems, multiple-mode input shapers can be tricky to derive and difficult to understand. This paper pro - poses a new approach for deriving input shapers using zero-placement in the discrete domain. The flexibility and simplicity inherent in this formulation provide many options for maximizing shaper performance.

Reference-contexts: Given this new approach to input shaping, conclusions will be drawn about how this method can be best utilized to suppress vibration in flexible mechanical systems. 2. Background In the late 1950s, O.J.M. Smith <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a feedforward technique, called Posicast Control, for constructing command inputs to eliminate unwanted vibration in mechanical systems. This technique remained largely unexplored until Singer [2] presented a similar strategy for shaping arbitrary actuator commands in real-time by convolving them with a sequence of impulses.

Reference-contexts: Using this approach, several researchers have noted that Singers robustness improvement can be implemented by placing multiple zeros at system poles. As an explanation of the effectiveness of input shaping for reducing machine vibration, Bhat <ref> [7] </ref> , in particular, noted that the necessary and sufficient condition for zero residual vibration is that the Laplace transform of the time bounded control input has zero component at the system poles.

Reference-contexts: For systems with multiple modes, shaped commands are typically constructed by cascading single-mode impulse sequences. Singer illustrated that, although this approach was effective, shorter-length sequences typically existed that would minimize distortion in the original command while eliminating all unwanted vibration. Hyde <ref> [8] </ref> extended Singers results by using nonlinear, numerical search algorithms to construct time-optimal impulse sequences for multiple-mode systems. As an alternate approach, Smith alluded that Posicast inputs for multiple-mode systems could be constructed by placing zeros over all unwanted system poles in the z-plane.
