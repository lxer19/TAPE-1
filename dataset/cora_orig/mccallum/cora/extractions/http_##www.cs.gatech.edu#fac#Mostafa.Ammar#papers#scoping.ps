Abstract: In Internet multicast, the set of receivers can be dynamic with receivers joining and leaving a group asynchronously and without the knowledge of the source(s). The Internet today uses source-based scoping by which the source determines how far its multicast transmissions will propagate. This mechanism, however, does not allow a receiver to bound the number of hops added to a multicast routing tree as a result of its join request or its continued membership. In this paper we explore the use of receiver-based scoping, in which a receiver's join request is augmented with one or more scope values. By use of these values, the receiver specifies its wish to join and remain in the multicast group as long as the number of additional hops its membership incurs is within its declared scope. In environments where a multicast receiver incurs a cost in relation to its incremental resource usage, this scoping technique can be used to give the receiver direct control over this cost. The paper is concerned with discussion of the design of the receiver-based scoping mechanism and its possible use within multicast applications. We also consider the implementation of the mechanism as an extension to the existing Internet multicast infrastructure in a manner that is independent of the multicast routing protocol in use. We also evaluate the effect of receiver-based scoping on receiver membership in the context of current MBone sessions.

Reference-contexts: Multicast packets are addressed to a group address. Receivers wishing to join the multicast group simply "listen" to the group's address and inform a local designated router of this via the IGMP protocol <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. A multicast routing protocol operating within the network ensures the delivery of multicast packets to joining receivers. Multicast scoping is one of the methods by which the propagation of multicast packets is controlled in such a dynamic environment.

This generalization would work well with IGMP v3 <ref> [3] </ref> which allows per source joins.

Reference-contexts: Routers decrement this counter and forward the packet only if the decremented counter value is larger than an administratively configured threshold. Forwarded multicast packets in this case contain the decremented value of the counter. Another more recently proposed technique relies on administrative scoping rather than TTL scoping <ref> [4] </ref> with essentially the same effect of limiting the propagation of multi-cast packets to within a defined region around the source. Because the source cannot control which receivers join a multicast group, scoping is the only multicast propagation (and hence multicast session cost) control method available to the source.

Reference-contexts: We also consider the implementation of the mechanism as an extension to the existing Internet multicast infrastructure and evaluate its use in the context of current MBone sessions. Multicast scoping in the Internet works in conjunction with multicast routing protocols that route the multicast packet over a tree <ref> [5, 6, 7] </ref>. In modern multicast routing protocols, the tree grows and shrinks to span the dynamic set of receivers. A path to a new receiver is grafted onto the tree whereas an existing path in the tree is pruned once it is no longer used to reach receivers. <p> There are two basic flavors of multicast routing protocols, ones that use a shared tree to deliver multicast packets from all sources <ref> [5] </ref>, and ones which use a separate routing tree per multicast source [6, 8]. Some routing protocols allow a hybrid approach [7]. All such protocols use some form of grafting and pruning of paths in order to accommodate dynamic group membership.

Section 2 presents our proposed receiver-based scoping approach and discusses many of the issues associated with the approach. <p> However, the total data rate on group G c is extremely small, and thus the overall network load incurred by the large routing tree for G c is minimal. These advertisement messages are conceptually similar to the Path messages as defined by RSV P <ref> [9, 10] </ref>, in that they traverse through the network via a path identical to the actual data of interest, but the advertisement messages themselves are smaller and less frequent than the data desired.

Reference-contexts: Receiver-Based Scoping and Multicast Cost Allocation A detailed analysis of how to allocate total costs of network services in a multicast environment is given by Herzog, Shenker, and Estrin in <ref> [11] </ref>. In this work, two basic cost allocation methodologies are proposed, Equal Tree Split (ETS) and Equal Link Split Downstream (ELSD). With the receiver-based scoping paradigm that we propose, another methodology is required in order to preserve fairness among the receivers and to recover all of the network costs incurred. <p> Thus we simply share the link costs equally among all downstream receivers, as follows: 8M k 2 RT i , cost for M k = C i =jRT i j. This is exactly the ELSD method proposed in <ref> [11] </ref>. This case can only occur when two or more receivers have joined with smaller L thresholds than some third receiver, and that third receiver subsequently left the group, as described in the example given in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: These include: 1. The Cost-Controlled Monitor: As multicast gains popularity, monitoring the usage of the network by the multicast groups becomes an important management function. Several monitoring/management tools exist <ref> [12, 13] </ref> today. In some cases, a network manager is interested in monitoring multicast packets received on groups that already have members within a certain locality. Receiver-based scoping would allow this to happen easily. This is an example where a forced leave may be desirable.
