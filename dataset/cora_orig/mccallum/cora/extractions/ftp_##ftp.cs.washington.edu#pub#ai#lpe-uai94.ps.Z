Title: Localized Partial Evaluation of Belief Networks  
Author: Denise L. Draper Steve Hanks

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of Washington,  
Abstract: in the network. Often, however, an application will not need information about every node in the network nor will it need exact probabilities. We present the localized partial evaluation (LPE) propagation algorithm, which computes interval bounds on the marginal probability of a specified query node by examining a subset of the nodes in the entire network. Conceptually, LPE ignores parts of the network that are "too far away" from the queried node to have much impact on its value. LPE has the "anytime" property of being able to produce better solutions (tighter intervals) given more time to consider more of the network.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Belief networks provide a way of encoding knowledge about the probabilistic dependencies and independencies of a set of variables in some domain. Variables are encoded as nodes in the network, and relationships between variables as arcs between nodes. Algorithms such as Pearl's polytree propagation algorithm <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> and Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter's clustering algorithm [ Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988 ] can solve the network, where "solving the network" means computing the exact marginal probability of each of the nodes in the network, possibly conditioned on evidence (observations of the values of some of the variables). <p> Our experience shows that in practice these equations produce sufficiently narrow results (and in particular, they converge rapidly as the input messages converge). 2.2 Propagating Messages We use a standard polytree propagation algorithm, as defined in <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> , with a a few minor modifications for efficiency. Since we are only computing the belief value for a single node, messages only need to be computed in a single direction, thus our propagation makes only one pass over the network instead of two. <p> The first two of these possibilities are relatively straightforward to implement. Presumably, most techniques for evaluating knots could be extended to handle interval-valued messages using the A/R algorithm, as long as the normalization constraints of the A/R algorithm can be met. We have extended the technique of cutset conditioning, <ref> [ Pearl, 1988, Suermondt and Cooper, 1991 ] </ref> , modifying the algorithm in two ways: In order to condition over individual knots instead of over the entire network [ Peot A D [0,1] p l loop. and Schachter, 1991 ] , messages originating from outside the knot must be treated as

Reference-contexts: Use a clustering method which creates a tree structure, such as [ Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988 ] , and apply LPE to the resulting tree. 2. For each multiply-connected portion of the network (knots, in the terminology of <ref> [ Peot and Schachter, 1991 ] </ref> ), insist that either all or none of the nodes and arcs composing the knot be in the active set. Use an interval-valued extension to an algorithm for multiply-connected networks, such as conditioning or clustering, on the knots in active set.

All three are anytime algorithms which incrementally refine bounds on a solution by taking into account progressively more information, and all three attempt to hasten convergence by processing information in order of greatest impact on the solution.
