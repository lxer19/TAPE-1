Abstract: We explore a simplified class of models we call swarms, which are inspired by the collective behavior of social insects. We perform a mean-field stability analysis and numerical simulations of the model. Several interesting types of behavior emerge in the vicinity of a second-order phase transition in the model, including the formation of stable lines of traffic flow, and memory reconstitution and bootstrapping. In addition to providing an understanding of certain classes of biological behavior, these models bear a generic resemblance to a number of pattern formation processes in the physical sciences.

These discrete rules are merely tools for the approximation of a continuous model, and other discretizations are possible. The agent (referred to as an "ant") will be allowed to move from site to site on a square lattice. <p> All of the branches initially appear stable, but after several hundred time steps, some abruptly disappear, decreasing the length of the network. In this second stage the network of ant traffic resembles qualitatively some network type experiments done with real ants [7] and the network theory of <ref> [9] </ref>, (and the basic discussion of the properties of these networks given there holds). The ants can neglect a branch by chance, and if the fluctuation in the density of the ants over the branch happens to be great enough, the neglect builds on itself and the trail disappears. <p> The region in which the lines form represents a cooperative effect between the fluctuations and the ordering behavior. The formation of lines can also be understood in terms of the theory in <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. In the region of the lattice where there are lines, the clumping effect is both unstable in the transverse direction and stable in the lateral direction of the particle motion, and it is this fact which gives rise to the formation of stable lines of traffic.

Reference-contexts: We will choose one of the simplest possible models for how this occurs.[9, 10, 11] The presence of a particle at x will "deposit" an amount of field per unit time. For insect swarms (x) is to be interpreted as the pheromonal field density <ref> [12] </ref> at x. An amount of field (x) will "decay" per unit time. The field might also diffuse in space with diffusion constant D such that the field will evolve according to @(x) = Dr 2 (x) + (x) (x); (2) where (x) is the particle density at x.

Reference-contexts: This gives rise to a peaked function for the average time an ant will stay on a line of ant traffic as the concentration of pheromone is varied a fact which has been repeatedly observed experimentally <ref> [13, 14, 15] </ref>. This is perhaps significant in light of one of the results presented here: trails and networks do not spontaneously form in the absence of this saturation 3 effect.

Reference-contexts: We analyze the case where the relaxation of the field (x) is very slow in comparison to the relaxation time of the particle density (x). In this case the field is said to slave <ref> [17] </ref> to the particle denisty, and the particle density can be removed from the picture in the following way. Since the field changes very little on these time scales we will assume it is constant as the particles equilibrate in the energy landscape U [(x)].

Reference-contexts: However, too far above the transition line the fluctuations are suppressed, and order dominates overwhelmingly. This means that the ants are basically induced to "turn around" with sufficient probability that only patches form. The role of such "U-turns", has been investigated experimentally and theoretically in <ref> [20] </ref>, where it was also suggested that they might play an important role in the self-organization of ant traffic. The region in which the lines form represents a cooperative effect between the fluctuations and the ordering behavior.
