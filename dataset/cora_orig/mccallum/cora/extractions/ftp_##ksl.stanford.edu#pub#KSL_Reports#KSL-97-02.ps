Title: Distributed Repositories of Highly Expressive Reusable Ontologies 1 Distributed Repositories of Highly Expressive Reusable Ontologies

Abstract: We present a vision of next generation tools and services that will enable the widespread development and use of computer interpretable ontologies. Central to that vision is the notion of distributed ontology repositories resident on multiple ontology servers containing large-scale highly structured ontologies and supported by sophisticated ontology construction, testing, merging, extraction, reformulation, and translation tools. The key enabler in the distributed ontology repository architecture is a network application programming interface (API) for ontology servers that will support storage, manipulation, and access to the contents of ontologies on a server. We describe how OKBC, an API specifically designed to provide knowledge-level interoperability among server and client systems, provides that support. We then consider the criteria for an ontology representation language and an agenda of extensions to current ontology representation languages that address major deficiencies in those languages and appear to be attainable in next generation languages. Finally, we address the issue of what reasoning is needed to support ontology repository construction and use, and describe a deductive retrieval facility under development for the Ontolingua ontology server that includes a theorem prover which runs as a background task to reformulate sentences so that are accessible by the servers special purpose high speed retrieval methods.

Reference-contexts: Introduction We have developed an ontology development environment called Ontolingua <ref> (Farquhar et al. 1996) </ref> that provides a suite of ontology authoring and translation tools and a library of modular reusable ontologies. The system is oriented toward authoring ontologies by assembling and extending ontologies obtained from the ontology library (Fikes et al 1997).

Reference-contexts: Introduction We have developed an ontology development environment called Ontolingua (Farquhar et al. 1996) that provides a suite of ontology authoring and translation tools and a library of modular reusable ontologies. The system is oriented toward authoring ontologies by assembling and extending ontologies obtained from the ontology library <ref> (Fikes et al 1997) </ref>. It has been available as a World Wide Web service (http://ontolingua.stanford.edu) for several years and has had a substantial user community at multiple sites.

Distributed Ontology Repositories Organizations and individuals often have strong ownership interests in the ontologies or components of ontologies that they develop.

Reference-contexts: The Ontolingua Representation Language The original Ontolingua language, as described in <ref> (Gruber 1993) </ref>, was designed to support the design and specification of ontologies with a clear logical semantics. To accomplish this, Gruber extended the Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF).

Reference-contexts: Ontology Competency Expressed as Procedural Methods A central issue when considering using an ontology from a repository in an application system is whether the candidate ontology supports the computations that are to performed by the application. That is, the potential user needs to assess the competency of the ontology <ref> (Gruninger and Fox 1994) </ref>. An important way in which to characterize the competency of an ontology is in terms of the computations that it supports.

Reference-contexts: Operations that expose a sentential view of the knowledge base, e.g., ask (ask a query), tell (assert a sentence). OKBC is a successor to the Generic Frame Protocol (GFP) <ref> (Karp et al 1995) </ref> and improves GFP in two significant ways.

Reference-contexts: Uncertainty One of the most significant gaps in the expressive power of current ontology representation languages is their inability to adequately represent uncertain and noisy information. Koller and Pfeffer <ref> (Koller and Pfeffer 1998) </ref> are developing a representation formalism which addresses this deficiency by cleanly integrating Bayesian networks into a frame-based representation language. Bayesian networks provide an intuitive and coherent probabilistic representation of uncertainty, but have been very limited in their ability to handle complex structured domains.

Reference-contexts: Sets of incompatible alternative descriptions (e.g., with different simplifying assumptions) to assure that at most one alternative from each group is included in an ontology. Such a facility would be a generalization of assumption classes as found in compositional modeling languages <ref> (Levy et al 1997) </ref>. Contexts The notion of context is central for representing many aspects of knowledge. Contexts in knowledge representation languages provide a means of referring to a group of related assertions (closed under entailment) about which something can be said.

Reference-contexts: An ontology library would then consist of a librarian service analogous to an information broker (Fikes, et al 1996) or information integration mediator <ref> (Wiederhold and Genesereth 1997) </ref> which provides a set of facilities for finding and retrieving ontologies from a collection of distributed servers. In addition to distributing ontologies over multiple servers, we envision distributing ontology-related services over multiple servers.
