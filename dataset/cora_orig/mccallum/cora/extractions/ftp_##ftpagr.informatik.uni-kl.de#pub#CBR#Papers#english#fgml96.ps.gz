Abstract: We present an approach to systematically describing case-based reasoning systems by different kinds of criteria. One main requirement was the practical relevance of these criteria and their usability for real-life applications. We report on the results we achieved from a case study carried out in the INRECA 1 Esprit project. In case-based reasoning (CBR) a huge number of systems (including commercial systems) has been developed so far and is steadily increasing. While this very dynamic situation corresponds to the situation in other computer science subfields like e.g. programming languages, the question arises whether a systematic description of CBR systems exists (again like for programming languages). The answer is yes: based on a number of case studies we developed a systematic description for CBR systems which includes a high number of different criteria like technical criteria dealing with the limitations and abilities of the CBR systems, ergonomic criteria concerning the consultation of the execution system and application development, application domain criteria dealing with concept structure, knowledge sources, and knowledge base characteristics as well as application task criteria like integration of reasoning strategies, decomposition methods, and task properties. One main requirement was the practical relevance and applicability of these criteria. We used them for a systematic comparison (evaluation) of the INRECA research prototype system with commercial CBR tools as well as CBR-related research prototype systems (Althoff, 1996). However, the criteria should also be helpful for application development, the integration of different methods, and tool development. The underlying intention of the criteria set can be best described as to give decision support for answering a number of questions (we therefore call these criteria decision support criteria as suggested in Althoff & Bartsch-Sprl, 1996). Important questions, which have been raised first by Cohen (1989) from the more general point of view of evaluating CBR research, are listed below. Though historically these questions have not been the starting point for our evaluation work, they are helpful for giving some structured overview of the used criteria. If we take e.g. the question How is the CBR method to be evaluated an improvement, an alternative, or a complement to other methods?, then we can derive the following sub-questions, which aim at characterising the associated system aspects (among others):
