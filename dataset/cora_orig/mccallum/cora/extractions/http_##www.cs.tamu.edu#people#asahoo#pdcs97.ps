Abstract: Efficient and accurate connection admission control (CAC) is essential in hard real-time communication. In a hard real-time system, every admitted connection must meet its deadline, otherwise the consequences may be catastrophic. Accurate delay analysis and proper amount of resource allocation are pivotal to the overall performance of the system. Both are more difficult to deal with in heterogeneous networks than in homogeneous networks. We address the issues of connection admission control in heterogeneous network. In particular, we design and analyze CAC methods based on partitioning deadlines. We demonstrate that this kind of partition-based CAC methods are simple, efficient, and scalable. Simulation data showed that systems with this kind of CAC methods can perform effectively in a wide range of system and payload parameters. Keywords: Heterogeneous Networks, Connection Admission Control, Real-Time Communication, Resource Allocation. 1 Introduction

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Much research has been done in Real-time communication. In real-time communication, messages are delay sensitive and have deadlines associated with them. Real-time messages have to be delivered before their deadlines so as to avoid disastrous consequences. Real-time communications have been studied for CSMA/CD [12], token ring [19], FDDI <ref> [1, 14] </ref>, slotted ring [16] and ATM and point-to-point networks [15]. Most of these studies are based on homogeneous networks. However, a lot of existing communication networks are heterogeneous in nature, consisting of different homogeneous subnetworks. <p> Determining delay bounds has been the main thrust of most of the research done in real-time communications. Worst case delay bounds have been analyzed in homogeneous networks in <ref> [1, 7, 15, 16, 17, 19] </ref>. Both shared media networks (e.g., IEEE 802.5, FDDI, and DQDB) and point-to-point networks (e.g., ATM) have been studied for real-time communications over homogeneous networks. <p> Both shared media networks (e.g., IEEE 802.5, FDDI, and DQDB) and point-to-point networks (e.g., ATM) have been studied for real-time communications over homogeneous networks. Worst case delays have been derived for IEEE 802.5 token ring networks [19], slotted ring networks [16], and FDDI networks <ref> [1] </ref>. Various connection admission criteria for different scheduling policies have been studied for connection-oriented networks. Earliest Deadline First scheduling for wide area networks has been analyzed by Ferrari and Verma in [7]. Deterministic delay bounds in networks have been discussed in [5]. <p> Between the arrival of a message and the expiration of its deadline (D S time units later), a node will have at least b D S TT RT S 1cH S synchronous bandwidth available <ref> [1] </ref>. Also, during D S time units, (D S R l;m ) can loosely be regarded as load on the node. Thus the allocated synchronous bandwidth is just sufficient to handle the load. Hence (8) and (9) follow.

Reference-contexts: It then strips off the LLC encapsulation and transmits the packet according to the MAC protocol of the destination LAN. For a detailed description of the working of an edge device please refer to <ref> [2] </ref>. IEEE 802.5 token ring is a ring based network. A Media Access Control (MAC) protocol determines how real-time messages can be scheduled for transmission in a ring network. A MAC protocol basically determines the access arbitration and capacity control policy for a network.

Reference-contexts: When such LANs are involved in a connection, the LAN with higher capacity may overwhelm the one with lower capacity with large amount of data. This may lead to congestion in the lower capacity LAN. In <ref> [3] </ref>, a CAC was developed for an FDDI-ATM-FDDI heterogeneous network. This CAC used feasible region method to admit a connection. In this method, a region for feasible resource allocation was first identified. <p> This method overcomes the drawbacks of the feasible region approach. In particular, the new method is simpler and more efficient in terms of computational complexity. It also provides a good scalability in comparison with the feasible region method. For example, the feasible region method proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> was designed for a heterogeneous network with FDDI LAN segments. If a network contains a token ring LAN segment, then a new way to analyze the feasible region has to be developed. Our new deadline partition method will not have such problem. <p> Decomposition approach has been used to compute delay in a connection-oriented packet-switched networks in [4]. ATM network was decomposed and its basic servers were analyzed in [17]. A feasible region method of allocating resources for FDDI-ATM-FDDI network has been proposed in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 ATM Based Heterogeneous Network (ABHN) Network In this section we will give a brief description of ATM-based Heterogeneous Network (ABHN) and its various components. An ABHN is a high performance network with high bandwidth capability at the backbone. <p> FIFO multiplexing has been implemented in most of the commercial ATM switches. For more detailed description on ATM please refer to [8]. 4 Partition-Based Connection Admis sion Control For heterogeneous networks, we had proposed feasible region based CAC in our study in <ref> [3] </ref>. In this study, we are proposing a partition-based CAC which is much simpler and can scale well to the new technologies that may be added to future heterogeneous networks. <p> So we have used the maximum rate function (I) as traffic descriptor, which is defined as the maximum arrival rate in any interval of length I (in bits/second). (I) has been successfully used as traffic descriptor in ATM networks [17] and in FDDI-ATM-FDDI networks <ref> [3] </ref>, for real-time applications. path connection path Now to illustrate how the decomposition method can be applied to our ABHN, consider a connection between Host1 on an FDDI LAN and Host7 on a 802.5 LAN in Figure 1 passing through points A, C, E, F, H, and J. <p> This method, though not optimal, is a much simpler method compared to the feasible region method proposed in <ref> [3] </ref>. It is also scalable to any new technology that may be introduced to existing heterogeneous network. We have proposed three different methods for partitioning the deadline and shown their performance in ABHN. The performance of partition-based connection admission control is also satisfactory in terms of admission probability.

Reference-contexts: The connection, in this case, crosses the ATM backbone. After receiving a packet, the edge device on the sender's side (ED1) may apply LLC encapsulation <ref> [9] </ref> (if LANE interface is not used), switch it to appropriate port and then segment the packet to ATM cells which are then transmitted to the ATM backbone. The edge device on the receiver's side (ED2) receives the cells from the ATM backbone and reassembles them.

Reference-contexts: But a priority is assigned to each message. The 802.5 MAC protocol guarantees a non-preemptive priority-driven policy. Thus, a problem equivalent to resource allocation is priority assignment. We propose to use the earliest deadline first (EDF) to assign priority. This assignment scheme has been extensively studied <ref> [13, 20] </ref>. The only modification we have to make is to use the sub-deadline obtained from the partition process, rather than the original deadline. Other LAN segments can be dealt with in a similar manner.
