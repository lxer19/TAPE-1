Abstract: Rather than adaptively adjusting the power supply voltage to the smallest possible value by using a state detecting circuit and a dc/dc converter additional to the FIFO [1], we propose to switch the supply voltage between two levels by using the Half-Full flag of the FIFO (FLAGMAN) [7]. Because two power supply voltages are already required on modern circuit boards for standard low-power ICs, e.g. Ps [2] and DSPs [3] for mobile systems, taking advantage of 2 supply voltages means zero-overhead for the board design. By investigating real-life data of portable systems, as far as temperature variation is concerned, we give an analysis of power savings achieved by this technique. As a practical example we use a self-timed IC which already has been designed and fabricated: A 4bit carry-save multiplier [4]. It turns out that applying the proposed power management results in potential power savings of up to 40 % for that IC, depending on the corresponding operating temperature and the choice of the supply voltage levels.

Reference-contexts: The processor core operates at a reduced voltage internally while the I/O interface operates at the standard voltage 3.3 volts, which allows the processor to communicate with existing 3.3 volt components in the system. This trend is not only for Ps, but also for high-performance DSPs <ref> [3] </ref>, developed for multi-function applications, e.g. wireless PDAs. Section 2 illustrates the principle of the power management and gives a formula of the power reduction factor achievable using this technique.
