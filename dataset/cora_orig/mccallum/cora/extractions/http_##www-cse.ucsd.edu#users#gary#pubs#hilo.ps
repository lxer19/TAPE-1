Title: Task and Spatial Frequency Effects on Face Specialization

Abstract: There is strong evidence that face processing is localized in the brain. The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent mechanisms in the brain. Is neural specialization innate or learned? We suggest that this specialization could be the result of a competitive learning mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing. Further, we suggest that the specialization arises as an interaction between task requirements and developmental constraints. In this paper, we present a feed-forward computational model of visual processing, in which two modules compete to classify input stimuli. When one module receives low spatial frequency information and the other receives high spatial frequency information, and the task is to identify the faces while simply classifying the objects, the low frequency network shows a strong specialization for faces. No other combination of tasks and inputs shows this strong specialization. We take these results as support for the idea that an innately-specified face processing module is unnecessary.

Reference-contexts: In previous work, we proposed that a neural mechanism allocating resources according to their ability to perform a given task could explain the apparent specialization for face recognition evidenced by prosopagnosia <ref> (Dailey, Cottrell, and Padgett, 1997) </ref>. We showed that a model based on the mixture of experts architecture, in which a gating network implements competitive learning between two simple homogeneous modules, could develop a specialization such that damage to one module disproportionately impaired face recognition compared to non-face object recognition.

Reference-contexts: This work indicates that low spatial frequency information may be more important for face identification than high spatial frequency information. Jacobs and Kosslyn (1994) showed how differential availability of large and small receptive field sizes in a mixture of experts network <ref> (Jacobs, Jordan, Nowlan, and Hinton, 1991) </ref> can lead to experts that specialize for what and where tasks.
