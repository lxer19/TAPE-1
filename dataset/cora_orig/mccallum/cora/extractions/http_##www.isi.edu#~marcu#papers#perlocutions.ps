Title: Perlocutions: The Achilles' Heel of Speech Act Theory  
Author: Daniel Marcu 
Address: Toronto, Ontario Canada M5S 3G4  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Toronto  
Abstract: This paper criticizes previous approaches to per-locutions and previous formalizations of perlocu-tionary effects of communicative actions by showing that some of their fundamental assumptions are inconsistent with data from communication studies, psychology, and social studies of persuasion. Consequently, it argues for a data-driven approach to pragmatics, one that permits pragmatic theories to be falsified and improved.

Reference-contexts: For example, virtually always and high probability have average quantitative probability meanings relatively near 99%, while unlikely, doubtful, and low probability are consistent with a probability value of 20% for some audiences <ref> (Bryant & Norman 1980) </ref>. In changing a quantitative discriminator into a qualitative one, it seems that the locutionary and illocution-ary parts of a speech act remain the same. However, empirical data supports the observation that perlocu-tionary effects differ. Lexical choice in general plays an important role in persuasive communication.

Reference-contexts: However, empirical data (McGuire 1968; Bettinghaus & Cody 1987) show that this is not the case. In fact, the most popular cognitive models of persuasion, the elaboration likelihood model (Petty & Ca-cioppo 1986) and the heuristic model <ref> (Chaiken 1987) </ref>, rely on a distinction between central and peripheral routes to persuasion, and systematic and heuristic processing, respectively. The central route is marked by a careful scrutiny of the message content: it posits that attitude change is a function of message content and elaboration.

Reference-contexts: The persuasive technique of framing seems to be one that could give plenty of trouble to speech act theorists. Despite controversies that exist with respect to psychological explanations of fear appeals and the relation between fear and persuasion <ref> (Hale & Dillard 1995) </ref>, researchers in communication agree that in some domains, in order to persuade, a message has to be framed in such a way that bad consequences are emphasized (Meyerowitz & Chaiken 1987; McNeil et al. 1982).

Reference-contexts: A key factor in persuasive communication is to go beyond simple reminders, continuously reinforce the beliefs that the receivers hold, and emphasize the cumulative risks that otherwise people tend to underestimate <ref> (Holtgrave, Tinsley, & Kay 1995) </ref>. <p> If we take speech act theory literally, there is no possibility of explaining why given a common set of conditions, speech acts that are characterized by the same locutionary and illocutionary acts, yield different per-locutionary effects. Let us consider a few examples. People have troubles reasoning with probabilities <ref> (Holtgrave, Tinsley, & Kay 1995) </ref> and there is great disagreement about how different probabilistic values are linked with qualitative adjectives (Mostellor & Youtz 1990).

Reference-contexts: making (Yates 1990; Holtgrave, Tinsley, & Kay 1995) shows that persuasion is not a constant function of beliefs and attitudes, but that it rather varies depending on the hearer's level of involvement, i.e., "the motivational state induced by an association between an activated attitute and some aspect of the self-concept" <ref> (Johnson & Eagly 1989, p. 293) </ref>, and the stage of change that the hearer (or the recipient) is in.

Reference-contexts: For example, one can smoke despite believing that smoking is unhealthy, or one could refuse to speak louder despite knowing that all other participants in the dialogue want one to speak louder. In fact, new information by itself rarely changes attitudes <ref> (Karlins & Abelson 1970) </ref>. On the contrary, if a text is to be persuasive, it will have to remind the hearer of information that she already knows (McGuire 1968; Holtgrave, Tinsley, & Kay 1995; Witte 1995).

Reference-contexts: If a speaker wants to be persuasive, he must not only include in the message information that is already known to the hearer, but must also make explicit the conclusions that are implicit <ref> (McGuire 1968) </ref>. In doing so, he will have to pay attention to the particular place in the text where these conclusions are embedded: explicit conclusions should go either first or last, but not in the middle. <p> This corresponds to the cue of using a climax ordering <ref> (McGuire 1968) </ref> and avoiding the saying of the best things, or the conclusions, in the middle of the text. Text (2), i.e., the text that is obtained from text (1) when we apply the changes discussed in this section, is still unlikely to be persuasive. <p> For a hearer who is aware both of the pros and cons, the message should first present the arguments against the goal that is intended to be achieved and support it afterwards <ref> (McGuire 1968) </ref>. In our example, when inoculation is performed, the teenagers are unaware of the pressure that they are going to be exposed to: therefore, it is better to move the third paragraph in text (2) to the beginning of the message (see text (3) below). <p> However, empirical data supports the observation that perlocu-tionary effects differ. Lexical choice in general plays an important role in persuasive communication. One way to increase persuasiveness is by eliminating all hedges, such as perhaps, maybe, and possibly. The use of metaphors <ref> (McGuire 1968) </ref>, "stronger" language and "pathetic" words (Bettinghaus & Cody 1987), and specific terms instead of abstract terms (Toulmin, Rieke, & Janik 1979, p. 142) increases the degree of persuasiveness.

According to Miller (1980), who defines a persuasive act as a message that is intended to shape, reinforce, or change the response of another, or others, inoculation is a form of persuasive communication.

Because understanding the message is an important prerequisite for the success of a persuasive communication act (McGuire 1968; Stiff 1994), in persuasive communication it is better if instead of quantitative discriminators, one uses the qualitative discriminators that are suggested by sociolinguistic research.

Reference-contexts: a recognition of the importance of the hearer's features in persuasion: an illustration of the successful applicability of demassification in health communication is provided by the fact that over 400 different HIV/AIDS programs exist today in San Fran-cisco alone, each aimed at a particular subaudience (e.g., gay Hispanic male prostitutes) <ref> (Rogers 1994) </ref>.
