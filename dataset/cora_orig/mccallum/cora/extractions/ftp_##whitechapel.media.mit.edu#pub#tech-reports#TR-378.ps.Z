Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 378 May 1996 Abstract The basic argument of this paper is that until recently theatrical performances involving human and computer actors were not possible due to the lack of appropriate computational models for action representation, recognition, and generation. This paper surveys and classifies some recent experiments in computerized performances, and uses this classification as a framework to establish the importance of action as a foundation of computer theater. It also argues that computer theater has many characteristics which qualify it as a good domain for AI and computer vision research on action. Finally, an example of a script for a computer theater performance is provided and analyzed in terms of scientific and technological challenges. Computer theater not only requires action representation and recognition but it is also an interesting domain for action research. To support this argument I begin by examining the multiple possibilities of making theater with computers, concerning both explored and unexplored developments. Some attempts to represent and recognize actions are examined in the second part of the paper, followed by the analysis of a very simple script written for a computer theater performance.
