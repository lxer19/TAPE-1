Abstract: In 13th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-96). AAAI Press, Portland, August 1996. Copyright 1996, American Association for Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved. The official version of this paper has been published by the AmericanAssociation for Artificial Intelligence (http://www.aaai.org). Abstract We present a method for specifying temporal constraints on trajectories of dynamical systems and enforcing them during qualitative simulation. This capability can be used to focus a simulation, simulate non-autonomous and piecewise-continuous systems, reason about boundary condition problems and incorporate observations into the simulation. The method has been implemented in TeQSIM, a qualitative simulator that combines the expressive power of qualitative differential equations with temporal logic. It interleaves temporal logic model checking with the simulation to constrain and refine the resulting predicted behaviors and to inject discontinuous changes into the simulation.

Reference-contexts: Discontinuities have been investigated by Nishida and Doshita (1987), Forbus (1989), Iwasaki and colleagues (1995), and others. The continuity relaxation method adopted in TeQSIM is conceptually simpler, sound, widely applicable and practically effective. Our trajectory specification language is similar in expressiveness to both Allen's interval algebra <ref> (Allen 1984) </ref> and Dechter, Meiri and Pearl's temporal constraint networks (Dechter, Meiri, & Pearl 1991). The usage of the language in TeQSIM, however, is quite different from these two formalisms.

Reference-contexts: A Control Problem TeQSIM has been applied to a variety of problems to address a range of tasks <ref> (Brajnik & Clancy 1996b) </ref>. This section provides a simple example to demonstrate how trajectory information can be used to constrain a qualitative simulation in a realistic setting. Suppose that operators of a dam are told of a forecasted perturbation to the flow of water into the lake. <p> We have extended this work to deal with conditionally true for mul and with behaviors that are not closed, i.e. still being extended by the simulator. The model checking algorithm, described in <ref> (Brajnik & Clancy 1996b) </ref>, computes the function t : Formul fi Behaviors ! fT; F; Ug fi C, where C is the set of all possible refinement conditions, including the trivial condition TRUE. A definite answer (i.e. <p> Proof. By induction on the length of '; see <ref> (Brajnik & Clancy 1996b) </ref>. Discussion and Conclusions We are currently exploring several directions to extend the expressiveness of the trajectory specification language.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 describes the relationship between the sources of constraining power within TeQSIM. Trajectory constraints are formulated using a combination of temporal logic expressions, a specification of discontinuous changes and a declaration of external events. Temporal logic expressions are written using a variation of a propositional linear-time temporal logic <ref> (Emerson 1990) </ref> that combines state formul specifying both qualitative and quantitative information about a qualitative state with temporal operators, such as until, always, and eventually, that quantify such properties over a sequence of states. <p> We have extended those defined in (Shults & Kuipers 1996) to provide a more abstract language to simplify the specification of assertions. Temporal logic formul are given meaning with respect to linear-time interpretation structures. These structures are extended from their typical definition (e.g. <ref> (Emerson 1990) </ref>) in order to accommodate the refinement of behaviors with quantitative information. In addition to defining a sequence of states and a propositional interpretation function, means for representing, generating and applying refinement conditions are provided.
