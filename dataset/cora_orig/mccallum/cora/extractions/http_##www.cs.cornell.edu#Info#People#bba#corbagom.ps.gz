Reference-contexts: 13. August 1996 1 Abstract The CORBA architecture [OMG] will be of significant importance in the future for building distributed systems. Nevertheless there are other systems (object models) that exist for the purpose of distributed computing such as COM [Brock], TINA [TINA], ANSA <ref> [ANSA] </ref> and for the purpose of management such as the OSI [X700] and SNMP [SNMP] network management standards. The goal of this paper is to show that the CORBA architecture can be enhanced to allow transparent access to those systems.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this paper is to show that the CORBA architecture can be enhanced to allow transparent access to those systems. The approach chosen is based on a generic object model <ref> [Ban95] </ref> that uses CORBA as distribution mechanism and provides a generic API to clients, the dynamic object model. Another component is the concept of adapters that take care of bridging requests between object models; their main use is the conversion of requests from one system to another. <p> This results in very small client applications (managers). A prototype implementing a subset of the proposed architecture has been written at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory <ref> [Ban95] </ref>. It is currently based on C++ rather than CORBA. The EIR is implemented as a UNIX daemon accessing an objectoriented database and using TCP/IP for communication. The database is populated / modified using a GDMO and an ASN.1 compiler that generate requests for a proprietary protocol based on TCP/IP.

Reference-contexts: 13. August 1996 1 Abstract The CORBA architecture [OMG] will be of significant importance in the future for building distributed systems. Nevertheless there are other systems (object models) that exist for the purpose of distributed computing such as COM <ref> [Brock] </ref>, TINA [TINA], ANSA [ANSA] and for the purpose of management such as the OSI [X700] and SNMP [SNMP] network management standards. The goal of this paper is to show that the CORBA architecture can be enhanced to allow transparent access to those systems. <p> For example, if the dynamic object model implementation resides on a UNIX machine and a COM 6 adapter is needed to access OLE-instances <ref> [Brock] </ref>, then the COMadapter can be implemented and instantiated on a Windows NT server on which OLE is available. This would not be possible on the UNIX machine on which the OLE libraries are not available 7 .

Reference-contexts: With the current set of adapters it is possible to handle CORBA [DSOM] and X.700 <ref> [CCI] </ref> instances. GOMscript 16 has simple values such as numbers, booleans, strings and aggregate values such as structs, unions and lists. <p> The CORBA IR is accessed directly to retrieve meta-information related to CORBA objects. Adapters are located in shared libraries, are loaded at startup-time and can be dynamically reloaded at runtime 18 . Two adapters are available, one for CORBA [DSOM] and one for X.700 <ref> [CCI] </ref>. Current work includes the porting of the prototype to CORBA according to the proposal. This basically means to define IDL interfaces for all C++ classes of the dynamic object model that are visible to clients. Also, adapters have to be defined as CORBA interfaces.

Reference-contexts: Also, addition of subclasses would have led to the recompilation of clients of the dynamic object model each time a new model was introduced. 3 This concept of representing aspects of an objectoriented system as objects themselves is called reification <ref> [Challa] </ref>. 4 This may for example be the distinguished name or the class object identifier (OID) in the X.700 object model.

Reference-contexts: Its core is very small and can be extended (additional functions and classes) through user-written components <ref> [Deri95] </ref> which are located in shared libraries. GOMscript can be started in daemon mode in which it waits for (potentially remote) clients to send scripts to be executed. <p> Also, adapters have to be defined as CORBA interfaces. The EIR will be revamped to become a CORBA service for multi-domain meta-information. 18 The idea and implementation was influenced by the concept of droplets <ref> [Deri95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: GOMscript can be started in daemon mode in which it waits for (potentially remote) clients to send scripts to be executed. This allows for implementation of simple roaming agents <ref> [Mage96] </ref> which are essentially scripts moving from machine to machine and taking their state with them. The architecture is shown in Fig. 8 below: At any time during its execution, a script may decide to migrate to a different machine.
