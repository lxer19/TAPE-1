Reference-contexts: We show below how to exploit the fact that our segment collections are connected | that it, that the union of all points in the red segment collection forms a connected subset of the plane (and similarly for the blue). Agarwal and Sharir <ref> [1] </ref> investigated this version, and gave an O (nff (n) log 2 n) algorithm to find one purple intersection when one exists, but their method could not be extended to find all purple intersections.

Unfortunately the convex case is too special to suggest the proper extension of the concept of a tracing to three and higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: To keep the length of this paper within reason, the details of these data structures and the associated analysis will be reported in a separate paper <ref> [3] </ref>. We are currently working on extending to arbitrary dimensions and to more general types of tracings our current results on orienting fiber products, defining tracings and convolutions, and the relationship of tracings with paintings. We view the importance of the work presented here to robotics as follows. <p> It uses a novel data structure that can sweep efficiently the upper envelope of a family of segments in the plane by maintaining only a partial vertical ordering among the segments. We will report of this algorithm and its detailed analysis in full elsewhere <ref> [3] </ref> | below we just indicate some of the ideas and highlights of the method. The upper envelope of an arrangement of n line segments is a well-known concept in computational geometry [7] and it has size O (nff (n)) (where ff (n) is the familiar inverse Ackermann function). <p> In contrast, to maintain the heap-like structure, only intersections that involve a parent and child in the heap need to be scheduled and examined | we call these tournament intersections. No result is known about the maximum number of tournament intersections for standard heap implementations. In <ref> [3] </ref> we introduce several heap-like structures for which we can prove that the number of tournament intersections is roughly linear.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Over ten years ago, Guibas, Ramshaw, and Stolfi <ref> [8] </ref> introduced the kinetic framework for Computational Geometry in two dimensions. They augmented the standard boundary representation of planar shapes via polygons or closed curves with certain additional information, to make them into closed tracings. <p> A tracing in addition specifies the direction the car is facing at each point, and that direction must be along the tan gent to the curve whenever the latter is defined. The combination of flocation, directiong is called a state in <ref> [8] </ref>. The direction of the car is the crucial new component that enables the definition of the convolution operation and gives it its desirable properties. The convolution is defined as a fiber product in [8], by matching states from the two factor tracings with the same direction, and then assembling those <p> The combination of flocation, directiong is called a state in <ref> [8] </ref>. The direction of the car is the crucial new component that enables the definition of the convolution operation and gives it its desirable properties. The convolution is defined as a fiber product in [8], by matching states from the two factor tracings with the same direction, and then assembling those into a tracing. <p> Disregarding the topology of tracings, and viewing them as bags of states as in <ref> [8] </ref>, the convolution operation remains exactly the same as in two dimensions: points x 2 M B and y 2 M R define a state (x; y) in the convolution just when their whiskers match. <p> We take the convention that the whisker set of an edge is the shortest arc that joins the whiskers of its adjacent faces. Therefore, there is no special step to represent edges in the tracing. This convention mirrors a similar one used for turns in two dimensions <ref> [8] </ref>. It gets its full relevance from the open/closed interpretation of tracings. Indeed, with this choice, an edge adjacent to two closed faces is closed (i.e. the painting has the same value on the edge as in the polyhedron interior). An edge adjacent to two open faces is open.

Reference-contexts: Almost nothing is known about the convolution operation in dimensions higher than two, except in the special case of convex bodies, where it is equivalent to the Minkowski sum; this case for 3-D polyhedral objects has been treated in <ref> [9, 2, 12, 17] </ref>. Unfortunately the convex case is too special to suggest the proper extension of the concept of a tracing to three and higher dimensions. <p> This issue was discussed at length by Guibas and Seidel <ref> [9] </ref> for two-dimensional convolutions, and it is not surprising that it pops up again in three dimensions. <p> In the sequel we will assume that k actually represents the number of these bichromatic pairs. In the case where B and R are convex tracings, in other words in the case where each whisker value appears only once per tracing, this problem has already been optimally solved <ref> [9] </ref> in O (n+k) time. The difficulty with general tracings is that their whisker maps can multiply cover S 2 | they are effectively Riemann surfaces over S 2 . <p> Though the case of computing the Minkowski sum has been well studied when both the polyhedra are convex <ref> [9, 6] </ref>, non-trivial bounds are not known for the computation of Minkowski sum for general non-convex polyhedra [11]. We argue that the convolution of polyhedra provides a low-storage alternate representation which encodes much of the same (and often more) information as the Minkowski sum.

Reference-contexts: We describe a data structure for representing polyhedral tracings based on the quad-edge data structure of Guibas and Stolfi <ref> [10] </ref> and give an efficient algorithm for computing the convolution of such tracings. Given tracings B and R of size m and n respectively, their convolution Q = B fl R can have size fi (mn) in the worst case. <p> A polyhedral tracing is a tracing such that its domain manifold can be decomposed into (interior-disjoint) simply connected subsets of three types: vertex domains, edge domains, and face domains, with connectivity properties akin to a subdivision as defined in <ref> [10] </ref>, and such that (Figure 1): 1. On a face domain, the whisker map is constant and the location map is a bijection whose range is a simple planar polygon, 2. <p> Third, the convolution of two (closed) polyhedra is in general not a polyhedron. Polyhedral tracings have in fact just the right expressiveness to allow the representation of convolutions of general non-convex polyhedra. 3.1 Enriched quad-edge structure A quad-edge structure <ref> [10] </ref> is an algebra (V; E; F; Onext; Org; Lface; Sym), where V (resp. E, F ) is the set of vertices (resp. edges, faces), with a number of relations between the operations which we do not review here.

We argue that the convolution of polyhedra provides a low-storage alternate representation which encodes much of the same (and often more) information as the Minkowski sum. First let us address the size issue. <p> If the two polyhedra are of sizes m and n their convolution is always of size O (mn), whereas the Minkowski sum can be fi (m 3 n 3 ) in the worst case (a construction where this happens can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>). The key savings in space and computation cost result from not computing or storing self-intersections of the convolution; these still give rise to features on the boundary of the Minkowski sum.

Reference-contexts: tracings, the convolution domain is defined to be that subset of M B fi M R satisfying: M Q = f (x; y) 2 M B fi M R j _r (x) = _ b (y)g This is an instance of a general categorical construction known as a fiber product <ref> [13] </ref> applied to the two whisker maps _r and _ b. Under mild assumptions (transversality) on the pair ( _r; _ b), the fiber product M Q is an oriented manifold of the same dimension as M B and M R , which makes the above define a valid tracing.

Reference-contexts: Paintings of arbitrary dimension were studied by Schapira <ref> [18] </ref> under the name of constructible functions. Using results from sheaf theory, Schapira was able to define a convolution operation on constructible functions and to show how it corresponds to the convolution of tracings discussed above. <p> The convolution of two paintings ; is then defined with respect to this integral R ( fl )(p) = q2E 3 and it relates to intersection problems in the following way <ref> [18] </ref>: Theorem 2.1. If ; are indicators of closed sets B; R, then the value of fl at a point p 2 E 3 is the Euler-Poincare characteristic of the intersection of B with R reflected through the origin and translated by p.
