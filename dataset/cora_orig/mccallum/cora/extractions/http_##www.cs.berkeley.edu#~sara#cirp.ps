Abstract: Inspired by the success of the CIF format in making rapid VLSI prototyping available to the naive designer, we are developing SIF, a new Solid Interchange Format for mechanical design. SIF is a terse, human readable ASCII format providing process- and resolution-independent ideal shape specification, explicit design intent and topological information; it also addresses issues of precision and tolerancing. SIF should carry enough information so that back and forth interactions between designers and fabricators can be reduced to a single one-way part submission after the designer runs standardized test programs to assure the consistency of the SIF representation and the manu-facturability of the part with the given process.

Reference-contexts: Another future extension of SIF may include a volumetric representations using voxels just like PostScript <ref> [1] </ref> has the capabilities of including bit maps in addition to its line and curve drawing features. This feature would be useful for mak-ing SFF models of data gathered from a 3D scanning source such as MRI, or for specifying the mi-crostructure of a non-homogeneous part.

Reference-contexts: Foremost is the ever growing family of SFF (Solid Freeform Fabrication) processes, which includes Stereolithography (SLA)[8], Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)[3], Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM)[6], Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)[4], Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM)[7], 3D Printing <ref> [12] </ref>, and several others. In all of these processes the object is built by depositing or solidifying material layer by layer.

Reference-contexts: This representation is a limited form of boolean CSG description called Destructive Solid Geometry (DSG) in which only difference operations are allowed, corresponding to the subsequent removal of individual holes and pockets <ref> [13] </ref>. The designer may have developed a detailed plan by which a sequence of geometrically simple geometrical operations can lead to a rather complicated final shape.

Reference-contexts: In CyberCut [18] the fixturing problem has been finessed to some degree by using Reference Free Part Encapsulation (RFPE) <ref> [14] </ref> for instance in a bi-phase material such as Rigidax. This allows the machining of fragile parts with narrow cross sections and thin spars or membranes, and avoids the complicated decisions of how to position, immobilize, and support the part for a particular operation.

Reference-contexts: Berkeley mechanical engineering department has built an interactive on-line tool with which designers can develop a DSG description for a part to be built with CyberCut, while getting immediate feedback from this program about the validity of individual milling steps or the limited capabilities of a partic ular tool <ref> [15] </ref>. The final high-level processing plan is then captured in this SIF DSG dialect and sent to other programs that will do the necessary macro-and microplanning before the part is machined on their 3-axis Haas milling machine.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, it lies below the design-oriented specification languages that may describe a part by a set of parameterized features and by the mutual constraints between them. Designers may use a high-level CAD environment to create their shapes or generate them with a procedural program <ref> [16] </ref>. A particular instance of such a description, with all its parameters evaluated and constraints satisfied, may then be expressed unambiguously in SIF and transmitted to a fabrication house, where the SIF description, after some macro- and microplanning, gets converted into the low-level instructions that drive the actual fabrication machine.

Reference-contexts: In traditional manufacturing by machining, the fabricator also has to deal with the problem of fixturing, which demands considerable experience with judging the strength of the emerging part in any step, and knowledge of the exact tools that will be used. In CyberCut <ref> [18] </ref> the fixturing problem has been finessed to some degree by using Reference Free Part Encapsulation (RFPE) [14] for instance in a bi-phase material such as Rigidax.
