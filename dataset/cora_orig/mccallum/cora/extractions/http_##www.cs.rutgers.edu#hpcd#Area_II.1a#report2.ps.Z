Abstract: ARPA Inlet Design Group Report No. 2 1. The inlets were designed using state-of-the-art methods (as of the early 1970s) to provide maximum total pressure recovery with minimum distortion of the flow at the throat. In particular, the inlets were designed to achieve cancellation of the cowl shock (common to both inlets) by design of the geometric contours on the ramp surface. Experimental data indicated, however, that cancellation of the shock was not achieved due to inadequate modelling of the shock-wave turbulent boundary layer

Static Pressure Distortion at Throat As indicated in <ref> [2] </ref>, ": : : The static pressure across the passage in the throat region should be approximately constant (a condition generally considered desirable at the combustor entrance). : : : " The static pressure distortion at the throat may be defined by 3 p p 1 Z H (p p) dy <p> The value of r p for the original inlet will be computed using the NPARC code. The modified inlet must have the same value of r p within 3% (which represents the maximum uncertainty in the experimental measurement of static pressure at the throat <ref> [2] </ref>). Based on a simple one-dimensional analysis, this constraint implies that the height of the throat is fixed. However, the height of the throat is not a specific design constraint.

Reference-contexts: The inlets are two-dimensional and bleed is not employed. Thus, the design space is simpler than the general 3-D supersonic inlet problem. 3. It has been demonstrated that a 2-D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes code, with a conventional engineering turbulence model, can accurately predict the measured inlet flowfield <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, there is confidence that the predictions of the NPARC code for modified P2 and P8 inlets would be accurate.
