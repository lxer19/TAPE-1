Abstract: The program MadGraph is presented which automatically generates postscript Feynman diagrams and Fortran code to calculate arbitrary tree level helicity amplitudes by calling HELAS[1] subroutines. The program is written in Fortran and is available in Unix and VMS versions. MadGraph currently includes standard model interactions of QCD and QFD, but is easily modified to include additional models such as supersymmetry.

Reference-contexts: Another advantage of helicity methods is that a program can easily be modified to decay the final state particles. Packages such as HELAS <ref> [1] </ref> and GRACE [6] use this technique.

Reference-contexts: Recently, several programs have been introduced to facilitate coding tree level processes. Some are based on symbolic manipulation packages such as Mathmatica, Maple, and Reduce. These packages include HIP <ref> [2] </ref>, Fey-nArts [3], FeynCalc [4], and Tracer [5]. They greatly aid in calculating matrix elements using traditional trace techniques. For processes with more than 5 external particles, the results of trace methods are often rather cumbersome so helicity amplitude techniques are used.

A user may convert to free-source form by adding trailing "&" continuation characters where appropriate. MadGraph creates a Fortran function as part of its output. By default, this function is written for f77 compilers using the non-standard extensions noted in Appendix A.

Reference-contexts: This version uses some VMS-specific nonstandard extensions to Fortran. 19 Eigensystem Notes MadGraph requires a routine which computes the eigenvalues and eigenvec-tors of a real symmetric matrix. The necessary routines from the Lapack <ref> [8] </ref> package are included with the distribution. If your system already has the Lapack libraries installed, you may remove the Lapack Fortran sources and use your library versions. In the single-file versions of MadGraph, the La-pack routines are at the end of the file.
