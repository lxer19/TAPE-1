Reference-contexts: Consider the closed-loop system _x = F (x (t)) and let denote the flow associated to this. Then H (x; t) := t t ; x x ; t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is a homotopy between F (x) and x. (As t ! 1 , the flow converges uniformly to zero by asymptotic stability, while as t ! 0 + this is F (x) by the definition of flow.) From this and the fact that F can have no zeroes -equilibria <p> To prove the Theorem, just note that the map H (x; t) := t ; x ; t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> provides a homotopy between the identity and the constant map H (x; 1 ) x 0 ; here is the flow induced by F as before. <p> The above formula for a stabilizing feedback law can be compared to the alternative proposed in [32], which is k (x) = b where : IR n ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is any function such that 1 where a 0 and 0 about b = 0. (Such functions exist, but are hard to construct explicitely.) Note that when it is known that a 0 for all x, one may try the feedback law k (x) := b. <p> Control and Information 5 (1988): 27-39. * Bacciotti, A., and P.

Reference-contexts: Also, the "small-control" property didn't play a role in that reference, but as remarked there -top of page 464-, the proof can be easily adapted. Theorem 7, which we will refer to as Artstein's Theorem, was originally given in <ref> [3] </ref>, which also discussed the example in Figure 7. It has since been rediscovered by others, most notably in [32] and other work by that same author. <p> Since solutions may not be unique, the assumption is that for every trajectory the asymptotic stability definition holds. By Kurzweil's Theorem, -see the discussion in <ref> [3] </ref>- there is a smooth clf, and hence by Theorem 7 there is an almost smooth feedback as desired. This explains our earlier remarks to the effect that the precise degree of regularity away from zero seems to be not very critical, so long as at least continuity holds. <p> Corless, and G.

For linear systems, Brockett's condition is that rank [A; B] = n which is the case s = 0 of the PBH criterion. Theorem 4 was given in <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: as a control) and the same is true for _x = g (x; u), what can one conclude about the cascade? More particularly, what if the "zero-input" system _z = f (z; 0) is already known to be asymptotically stable? There are many reasons for studying these problems ([34], [17], <ref> [7] </ref>): * They are mathematically natural; * In "large scale" systems one can often easily stabilize subsystems; * Many systems, e.g. "minimum phase" ones, are naturally decomposable in this form; * In "partial linearization" work, one has canonical forms like this; * Sometimes two-time scale design results in such systems. <p> Then u := fi (x)y + h (z; y) stabilizes the y-subsystem, and hence also the cascade by Theorem 10.

In [29], an application to rigid body control is given, in which the equations naturally decompose as above. Another such example is the following one.

Reference-contexts: But then Lyapunov's Second Theorem on Stability, or one of its variants such as Cheataev's Theorem, -applied to the x 2 -equation,- implies that the closed-loop system is unstable, contradicting the assumption. The second result is "folk" knowledge, and an analogous result for arbitrary-rate stabilization was given in <ref> [12] </ref>. A sketch of its proof is as follows. Sufficiency is proved as with Theorem 1. Conversely, assume that k is a smooth feedback stabilizer, and look at the closed-loop system.

Reference-contexts: Under extra hypotheses on the system, such as that f be globally Liptschitz, the ISS (or the BIBS) conditions can be relaxed -the paper [31] provides a detailed discussion of this issue, which was previously considered in [37] and <ref> [19] </ref>. Consider now the more general case in which the ISS condition fails. The last statement in Theorem 10 suggests first making the z-system ISS, using Theorem 8 (b), and thus proving stabilizability of the composition. <p> Byrnes and A.

Reference-contexts: * A piecewise-analytic synthesis of controllers was shown to be possible under control lability and analyticity assumptions on the original system ([30]); * If constant-rate sampling is allowed, piecewise-linear feedback can often be imple mented ([22]); * Pulse Width Modulated control is related to sampling and becoming popular (see e.g. <ref> [20] </ref>). 11 Output Feedback Typically only partial measurements are available for control. Some authors have looked at output stabilization problems, and in particular the separation principle for ob server/controller configurations; see e.g. [35]. For linear systems, one knows that output (dynamic) stabilizability is equivalent to sta-bilizability and detectability.

Reference-contexts: But this system is asycontrollable, so we know that there do exist continuous clf's. Figure 8 illustrates what a typical level set for one such clf may look like; note the singularity due to lack of smoothness. Theorem 6 was proved in <ref> [24] </ref>, and is based on the solution of an appropriate optimal control problem. "Relaxed" controls are used there, because the more general case of systems not affine in controls is treated, but the proof here is exactly the same.

Reference-contexts: However, one can still try to apply the above control law, and the formula gives in this case precisely the same feedback, x 1 x 2 (we thank Andrea Bacciotti for pointing this out to us). 8 Input-to-State Stability The paper <ref> [25] </ref> studied relations between state-space and operator notions of stabilization. <p> We do not give here the precise definition of input-to-state stable system (ISS), save to point out that such stability implies asymptotic stability when u 0 as well as bounded trajectories for bounded controls; see also [27] for related properties. The main Theorem from <ref> [25] </ref> is: Theorem 8 (a). If the system _x = f 0 (x) + G (x)u is globally smoothly (respectively, almost smoothly) stabilizable then there exists a smooth (respectively almost smooth) k so that (4) is ISS.

If the system _x = f 0 (x) + G (x)u is globally smoothly (respectively, almost smoothly) stabilizable then there exists a smooth (respectively almost smooth) k so that (4) is ISS. <p> This follows from classical "total stability" theorems, and was proved for instance in [34] and in a somewhat different manner in <ref> [27] </ref> using Lyapunov techniques. The same result holds for almost-smooth stabilizability. There is also a global version of the above: Theorem 10. <p> considerably, to the statement: If x (t) ! 0 as an input to the z-subsystem, then for every initial condition z (0), the trajectory z () is defined globally and it remains bounded. (The theorem shows that in fact it must then also go to zero.) For a proof, see <ref> [27] </ref>. Under extra hypotheses on the system, such as that f be globally Liptschitz, the ISS (or the BIBS) conditions can be relaxed -the paper [31] provides a detailed discussion of this issue, which was previously considered in [37] and [19].

Reference-contexts: Theorem 7, which we will refer to as Artstein's Theorem, was originally given in [3], which also discussed the example in Figure 7. It has since been rediscovered by others, most notably in <ref> [32] </ref> and other work by that same author. In every case, the proof is based on some sort of partition of unity argument, but we sketch below a simple and direct proof. This result is very powerful; for instance, it implies: Corollary. <p> The above formula for a stabilizing feedback law can be compared to the alternative proposed in <ref> [32] </ref>, which is k (x) = b where : IR n ! [0; 1] is any function such that 1 where a 0 and 0 about b = 0. (Such functions exist, but are hard to construct explicitely.)

Reference-contexts: Here we limit ourselves to a few references: * Techniques from optimal control theory typically result in such stabilizing feedbacks; * There are many classical techniques for discontinuous control, such as sliding mode systems (see e.g. <ref> [33] </ref>); * A piecewise-analytic synthesis of controllers was shown to be possible under control lability and analyticity assumptions on the original system ([30]); * If constant-rate sampling is allowed, piecewise-linear feedback can often be imple mented ([22]); * Pulse Width Modulated control is related to sampling and becoming popular (see e.g.

Reference-contexts: If _z = f (z; 0) has 0 as an asymptotically stable state and if _x = g (x; u) is locally smoothly stabilizable then the cascade is also locally smoothly stabilizable. This follows from classical "total stability" theorems, and was proved for instance in <ref> [34] </ref> and in a somewhat different manner in [27] using Lyapunov techniques. The same result holds for almost-smooth stabilizability. There is also a global version of the above: Theorem 10.

Reference-contexts: Some authors have looked at output stabilization problems, and in particular the separation principle for ob server/controller configurations; see e.g. <ref> [35] </ref>. For linear systems, one knows that output (dynamic) stabilizability is equivalent to sta-bilizability and detectability.
