Abstract: Researchers in computer vision have primarily studied the problem of visual reconstruction of environmental structure that is plainly visible. In this paper, the conventional goals of visual reconstruction are generalized to include both visible and occluded forward facing surfaces. This larger fraction of the environment is termed the anterior surfaces. In this paper, we show that the boundaries of the anterior surfaces can be represented in viewer-centered coordinates as a labeled knot diagram. Where boundaries are not occluded and where surface reflectance is distinct from that of the background, boundaries will be marked by image contours. However, where boundaries are occluded, or where surface reflectance matches background reflectance, there will be no detectable luminance change in the image. Deducing the complete image trace of the boundaries of the anterior surfaces under these circumstances is termed the figural completion problem. The second half of this paper describes a computational theory of figural completion. A working model is demonstrated on a variety of illusory contour displays. The experimental system employs a two stage process of completion hypothesis and combinatorial optimization. The labeling scheme is enforced by integer linear inequalities so that the optimal feasible solution of an integer linear program defines a topologically valid surface organization.

Reference-contexts: Solving this problem is a subject for future work. 2.2 Experimental system To simplify implementation of the experimental system, "off-the-shelf" components were used wherever possible. For example, the straight-line grouping algorithm developed by Boldt <ref> [1] </ref> was used to generate the input set of boundary fragments. Consequently, the experimental system was tested with straight-sided figures. <p> The specific values which comprise C corner , C straight and C generic were chosen partly by design and partly by trial and error (see [12]). 2.2.3 Building the graphs The straight line segments which serve as input to the experimental system are produced by Boldt's zero crossing grouping algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. In general, if there are n boundary fragments with 2n endpoints, there will be O (n 2 ) potential completions and O (n 4 ) crossing vertices in G planar .

Reference-contexts: Specifically, he shows that every knot diagram satisfying the labeling scheme illustrated in Figure 1 represents a generic view of an anterior scene. The proof is based upon the existence of a procedure for building a combinatorial model (i.e. a paneling <ref> [2] </ref>) of an anterior scene from a set of closed plane-curves satisfying the labeling scheme. 2 Problem formulation In this section, a computational theory of figural completion is described.

Reference-contexts: This allows the figural completion problem to be decomposed into two independent sub-problems, the first devoted to shape, the second devoted jointly to unit and depth. Many researchers have proposed that the shape of an illusory contour is described by the curve of least energy <ref> [3, 7, 10] </ref>. Indeed, Nitzberg and Mumford have used elastica to represent potential completions in a combinatorial optimization approach to figural completion. 1 However, Witkin and Tenenbaum [13] offer the most convincing explanation of why this should be so.

Reference-contexts: In our analysis, 0-1 valued expressions are interpreted as events. If two points in the feasible region are to be compared, then each must be interpreted as a prediction over the same set of events (i.e. 0-1 valued expressions). Following Lowe <ref> [5] </ref>, we propose that the prediction consist of an assignment to each element of the set of potential completions, the label "accidental" or "non-accidental." Since the set of potential completions is of fixed size, these predictions are equally specific.

Reference-contexts: Decomposed in this way, it proved possible to formulate the second sub-problem as an integer linear program, which led to a unique solution. Next we described an experimental implementation. Our intention was not to realistically model human vision at the "level of algorithm and representation <ref> [6] </ref>." Instead, our intention was to validate the computational theory by demonstrating that a well defined procedure for computing the mapping between input and output does in fact exist. The experimental system was demonstrated on a number of illusory contour figures from the visual psychology literature.

They also describe a combinatorial optimization approach where potential completions are explicitly represented by curves of least energy.

Reference-contexts: The ILP is solved by the method of branch and bound search <ref> [8] </ref>. When an optimal feasible solution exists, it is interpreted as a labeling of G planar , which defines G knot (i.e. a labeled knot diagram). The labeled knot diagrams computed for the four test figures are shown in Figure 5.

Reference-contexts: These constraints have two sources. The first is the requirement that the organization be a labeled knot diagram. This can be termed the topological validity requirement. Only plane-curves satisfying the labeling scheme define topologically valid anterior scenes. The second source of con straints has been stressed by Irvin Rock <ref> [9] </ref>, and is termed the stimulus conformity requirement. <p> Also important, if a completion is instantiated, and its boundary depth equals zero (indicating that it should be visible) then the absence of a corresponding luminance boundary should be explainable. In Rock's <ref> [9] </ref> words "the solution must not contradict the stimulus." Following Rock, we hypothesize that illusory contours occur only in those situations where the missing section of surface boundary presumably projects to the image plane with little or no brightness change. <p> Because a given unit organization will usually admit many different depth label-ings, the majority of these equivalence classes will contain many distinct (athough equally "likely") integer points. If the goal is to compute a unique surface or ganization, then additional preference criteria must be employed (see Rock <ref> [9] </ref>). Unfortunately, it is difficult to design an objective function which incorporates these criteria without introducing a bias for (or against) unit organizations with larger numbers of completions (see [12]).

Reference-contexts: But does a set of closed contours satisfying the labeling scheme always define an anterior scene? Is the labeling scheme necessary and sufficient? In his recent Ph.D. thesis, Williams <ref> [12] </ref> shows that this is in fact the case. Specifically, he shows that every knot diagram satisfying the labeling scheme illustrated in Figure 1 represents a generic view of an anterior scene. <p> If the goal is to compute a unique surface or ganization, then additional preference criteria must be employed (see Rock [9]). Unfortunately, it is difficult to design an objective function which incorporates these criteria without introducing a bias for (or against) unit organizations with larger numbers of completions (see <ref> [12] </ref>). Solving this problem is a subject for future work. 2.2 Experimental system To simplify implementation of the experimental system, "off-the-shelf" components were used wherever possible. For example, the straight-line grouping algorithm developed by Boldt [1] was used to generate the input set of boundary fragments. <p> Although these "densities" are not normalized, the heuristic likelihood function re turns values between 0 and 1 and these values are used as probabilities. The specific values which comprise C corner , C straight and C generic were chosen partly by design and partly by trial and error (see <ref> [12] </ref>). 2.2.3 Building the graphs The straight line segments which serve as input to the experimental system are produced by Boldt's zero crossing grouping algorithm [1].

Reference-contexts: Many researchers have proposed that the shape of an illusory contour is described by the curve of least energy [3, 7, 10]. Indeed, Nitzberg and Mumford have used elastica to represent potential completions in a combinatorial optimization approach to figural completion. 1 However, Witkin and Tenenbaum <ref> [13] </ref> offer the most convincing explanation of why this should be so. They point out that while minimum energy solutions are not significantly more likely than other interpolating curves, the simple fact that a smooth low energy interpolating curve exists is itself a reliable indicator of a non-accidental relationship.
