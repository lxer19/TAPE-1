Title: A Multi-frame Structure-from-Motion Algorithm under Perspective Projection  
Author: John Oliensis 
Address: 4 Independence Way Princeton, N.J. 08540  
Affiliation: NEC Research Institute  
Abstract: We present a fast, robust algorithm for multi-frame structure from motion from point features which works for general motion and large perspective effects. Experimental results on synthetic sequences show that the algorithm gives results essentially as accurate as the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) in a couple of seconds on an IRIS 10000 (for 15 images of 30 points). The results are significantly better than those of an optimal two-image estimate. In cases when the camera projection is close to scaled orthographic, the results are comparable to those of the Tomasi/Kanade algorithm, and the algorithms are comparably fast. The algorithm incorporates a quantitative theoretical analysis of the bas-relief ambiguity and exemplifies how such an analysis can be exploited to improve reconstruction accuracy. Also, we demonstrate a structure-from-motion algorithm for partially calibrated cameras, with unknown focal length varying from image to image. Unlike the projective approach, this algorithm fully exploits the constraint that the sequence was taken by a single camera whose calibration is fixed and known apart from the focal length. It is given by a simple modification of our algorithm for calibrated sequences and is also insensitive to errors in calibrating the camera center. In addition, we show theoretically that unknown focal-length variations in effect strengthen the bas-relief ambiguity. This paper includes an extensive experimental study of two-frame reconstruction and the Tomasi/Kanade approach in comparison to our algorithm. Our analysis of the bas-relief ambiguity is crucial in understanding the results. We find that two-frame algorithms are surprisingly robust and accurate, apart from the effects of the bas-relief ambiguity, but we also show that they do have problems with local minima. Apart from these problems, we demonstrate experimentally that a near-optimal two-frame reconstruction can be computed quickly, by a minimization in the motion parameters alone. Lastly, we show that a well known problem with the Tomasi/Kanade algorithm is often not a significant one. Keywords: Structure from motion, multi-frame structure from motion, rigorous results, optimal estimation, orthographic projection, shape from X, reconstruction, experiments.

Reference-contexts: This can be done exactly [25][18] <ref> [8] </ref>.

Then D CH BS 3 A T : (9) From standard results of matrix perturbation theory <ref> [8] </ref>, this procedure computes the true B, S 3 , A up to o (s 4 =s 3 ) corrections, where s 3 ; s 4 are the third and fourth singular values of D CH . <p> To compute M T M 's least eigenvector when the number of feature points N p is large, one can use the standard preconditioned conjugate-gradient method <ref> [8] </ref>. If started with a good initial estimate, this method will give accurate estimates of the least eigenvector in a small number of iterations.

When M T M has more than one small eigenvalue, perturbation theory <ref> [8] </ref> implies that errors contaminate the structure recovered as the least eigenvector of M T M by mixing in the eigenvectors associated with the other small eigen-values. The amount of mixing is scaled roughly by the size of the errors relative to these other small eigenvalues. <p> Also, the basic kernel of our algorithm involves computing the three leading singular vectors of D CH or ~ D CH . Though we currently do this using the MATLAB implementation of SVD, much faster methods exist which do not require computing the full SVD <ref> [8] </ref>. Also, one could speed up the iterative phase of our algorithm by taking the previously computed singular vectors as the starting point for their next computation. This paper also presents some of the first experiments comparing two-frame and multi-frame reconstructions.

Also, our algorithm's starting reconstruction contains more information and is closer to a full reconstruction than that of the projective approach. Of course, our approach does initially neglect the miscalibration, but the resulting errors are easier to understand and correct than the effects of neglecting the fixed calibration.

Reference-contexts: Most important is our quantitative analysis of the bas-relief ambiguity. By treating specially the structure component affected by this ambiguity, the algorithm obtains near-optimal accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Thus, in evaluating multi-frame algorithms, it is important to verify that 28 they successfully exploit the additional images and do perform better than two-frame reconstruction. We compared our algorithm to a standard two-frame approach (for example, [50] <ref> [24] </ref>) for Experiments 1, 6, and 7. This requires choosing two images to reconstruct with. We attempted to choose images that would give the best possible structure recovery.

Reference-contexts: However, surely Gaussian or uniform noise is a reasonable model for much of the uncertainty in localizing image features. (When the motion is small and the entire image is used to establish correspondence, it can be a good model <ref> [27] </ref>.) For a strongly overconstrained problem like multi-frame SFM, reconstruction should not depend sensitively on the detailed distribution of image errors when the errors are small, and even occasional large errors should not affect it much 28 .

Reference-contexts: Our theoretical analysis of the bas-relief ambiguity is crucial in understanding the results. We find that two-frame algorithms are surprisingly robust and accurate, apart from the effects of the bas-relief ambiguity, but we also show that they do sometimes have problems with local minima (but see <ref> [33] </ref>). These problems aside, we demonstrate experimentally that minimizing the weighted-coplanarity error (25) gives an essentially perfect approximation to the optimal two-frame reconstruction 3 . Since this is a minimization just in the motion parameters, our combined results show that a near-optimal two-frame reconstruction can be computed quickly and reliably. <p> Thus our algorithm is trustworthy. It is guaranteed to work when its basic assumption is valid, but it also signals when its results are unreliable because its assumption is violated. In contrast, generic iterative procedures such as Levenberg-Marquardt optimization can converge to incorrect reconstructions without warning (e.g., <ref> [33] </ref>). We have argued in [35, 36, 37] that there are no effective general-purpose SFM algorithms: to be effective, an SFM algorithm must exploit the conditions of the domain for which it is intended. The algorithm presented here is guaranteed to work well in its domain. <p> Thus, apart from minor local-minimum problems, our results confirm that minimizing (25) gives a translation that agrees closely with the MLE. Note that the three exceptional trials all occurred for ground-truth translations less than 17 ffi from the z direction. This accords with our finding in [34] and <ref> [33] </ref> that there can be many local minima near the z direction 41 . As a further test, we created an additional 200 sequences with T very close to z. <p> This factorization 41 Also, the error is less likely to be flat near the z direction <ref> [33] </ref>, so the three large discrepancies in the reprojection-errors probably do reflect local minima rather than flatness of the error. 42 The images in I must be translated so that their centers of gravity are at the origin. 43 One can get an o (N p )-time version of the Tomasi/Kanade

Reference-contexts: In addition, we present a new algorithm for a partially calibrated camera, where the focal length is unknown and can vary from image to image. Unlike the projective approach, which loses accuracy because it assumes that the entire calibration can vary arbitrarily over the sequence <ref> [35] </ref>, this second algorithm fully exploits the constraint that the sequence was taken by a single camera whose calibration is fixed and known apart from the focal length. <p> Since this is a minimization just in the motion parameters, our combined results show that a near-optimal two-frame reconstruction can be computed quickly and reliably. For three or more frames, in contrast, we argued in <ref> [35] </ref> there is no way to eliminate the structure parameters and still guarantee a near-optimal reconstruction. <p> Indeed, the experiments in this paper verify that two images are sometimes too few for good reconstruction (Section 3.4.5). When this happens, the few-frame reconstructions are often so unreliable that fusing them is not enough to give robustness: one must reconstruct directly from sufficiently many images <ref> [35] </ref>. Thus our algorithm follows the Tomasi/Kanade approach [55] and reconstructs directly from many images rather than fusing few-frame reconstructions 9 10 . On the other hand, as we have already indicated (see [35]), to be effective a multi-frame algorithm must exploit the information in the multiple images near-optimally, i.e., it <p> that fusing them is not enough to give robustness: one must reconstruct directly from sufficiently many images <ref> [35] </ref>.

On the other hand, as we have already indicated (see [35]), to be effective a multi-frame algorithm must exploit the information in the multiple images near-optimally, i.e., it must compute an approximation to the multi-frame MLE. We have designed our algorithm to approximate the MLE as closely as possible. <p> See <ref> [35] </ref>. 11 For instance, [29, 5, 41, 49, 16, 53, 54, 47, 2, 45, 51].

In contrast, generic iterative procedures such as Levenberg-Marquardt optimization can converge to incorrect reconstructions without warning (e.g., [33]).

Step 2a: Elimination of first-order effects of rotation error. Step2b: Depth recovery. Step2b1: Factorization of data matrix of image displacements. Step2b2: Depth recovery from leading singular vectors of data matrix. Step2b3: Repeat Step2b2 correcting for bias. <p> But the initial results in the projective approach are inaccurate, due to the neglect of the fixed-calibration constraint, and the final Euclidean reconstruction inherits this inaccuracy unless the projective results are recomputed at some stage assuming fixed calibration 48 . See <ref> [35] </ref>. In our proposed approach, we exploit the fixedness of the calibration from the beginning and lose no accuracy through neglecting it.

In operation, the algorithm first recovers the rotation based on what is known about the translations and depths and then improves the translation- and depth-estimates using the recovered rotations. <p> We recover the rotations separately between the base frame and every other frame by a standard technique assuming that the translations are zero.

Reference-contexts: For non-general motion, one must apply the related algorithms reported in <ref> [39] </ref>. Note that we can determine from the data whether the general motion criterion is satisfied; see the discussion of Experiment 9. Which algorithm to apply can be determined automatically. 2 This comparison is clearly algorithm- and implementation-dependent and is intended only to be indicative. <p> Lastly, we show that a well known problem with the Tomasi/Kanade algorithm is often not a significant one. In this paper we assume no occlusion. The algorithm can be extended to handle occlusion using methods such as in [20].

Since it is also targeted for large perspective effects, it is ideal for use in outdoor robot navigation 7 . <p> comparing and adjusting optimized reconstructions from different image pairs. 6 For multiple-image sequences, ambiguous two-frame reconstructions caused by special scene configurations (e.g., planar scenes) can generally be resolved by comparing reconstructions from different image pairs. 7 However, for ground navigation we must implement our approach via the related algorithms of <ref> [39] </ref>, since in this case the translational motions are roughly confined to a plane rather than general. 8 Optimization is the most reliable current approach, but how reliable it is starting from a poor initial guess has not been established and is difficult to analyze. 9 Nevertheless, our algorithm (through its <p> Step 2b3 eliminates a large part of the bias and significantly improves the structure reconstruction in our experiments. The greatest improvement occurs in the inverse depth component that is intrinsically difficult to reconstruct accurately due to the bas-relief ambiguity (see next section) <ref> [39, 52] </ref>. At worst this Step should do little harm, since it is only adjusting the bias in the previous computation. 2.3.3 The Bas-Relief Ambiguity A few inverse-depth components are intrinsically more difficult to recover accurately than the rest. <p> It is easy to show 21 from the explicit form of the rotational flows x;y;z that H T has one particularly small eigenvalue and that the corresponding least eigenvector is approximately f1g, the constant component of the inverse depths <ref> [39] </ref>. Experimentally, we always find that BR f1g : Thus BR roughly equals the least eigenvector of H T , and it is the most difficult component to recover precisely because its translational flows are the most confusable with rotational flows. <p> Note that f1g gives the scale of the overall relief of the scene, and the difficulty of recovering this component is exactly the usual bas-relief ambiguity <ref> [52, 39] </ref>. The bas-relief ambiguity is usually understood to imply that just a single component of the structure is difficult to recover. In general more than one can be, as pointed out in [21] (for constant motions) and [39]. <p> The bas-relief ambiguity is usually understood to imply that just a single component of the structure is difficult to recover. In general more than one can be, as pointed out in [21] (for constant motions) and <ref> [39] </ref>. But, for the cases considered in this paper, the BR component is more difficult than the others, and we single it out for special treatment. 2.3.4 Step 2c: Correcting the Bas-Relief Ambiguity Step 2b3 still neglects some sources of bias. <p> The next step of our algorithm eliminates these biases, at least for the BR component, by directly 20 Typically three eigenvalues are potentially small in addition to the zero eigenvalue of ^ M.

For example, in two real image sequences <ref> [39] </ref> and our current synthetic experiments, the f1g component usually accounts for 90% or more of the magnitude of jf~gj. <p> Real-image experiments with related algorithms can be found in <ref> [39] </ref>. We use synthetic sequences because we are primarily interested in the numerical properties of the algorithm and especially in how well it compares to the true MLE and to two-frame reconstruction. <p> points are close to the camera. (Note that this can be determined automatically from the data, from the largeness of the residual image displacements after the Step-1 rotation compensation.) As a result, the translational image displacements are large, and applying a two-frame SFM algorithm followed by fusing should work well <ref> [39] </ref>. An intrinsically multi-frame algorithm like the one presented here is unnecessary. Nevertheless, even though the domain is better suited to other types of algorithms, our algorithm does work well. But it does need more iterations to converge than in the previous experiments|on average 20:3. <p> This is not a fundamental problem: one can use the number of large singular values of D CH to automatically 37 Two- or three-image sequences can be dealt with by the related algorithms reported in <ref> [39] </ref>, see footnote 1. 26 ERRORS Iteration 1 Iteration 3 Converged Improved MLE Selected Mean Depth 0.518 0.311 0.280 0.171 0.080 .103 Constant Component 0.098 0.056 0.051 0.022 0.009 .013 Non-constant Components 0.008 0.006 0.005 0.005 0.003 .003 Translation 0.894 0.486 0.377 0.117 0.072 .085 Rotation 15.000 5.979 5.359 0.652 0.337 <p> Results for 840 out of 1000 trials selected as described in the text. detect sequences with non-general translations and then apply the related algorithms specialized for these <ref> [39] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: When this happens, the few-frame reconstructions are often so unreliable that fusing them is not enough to give robustness: one must reconstruct directly from sufficiently many images [35]. Thus our algorithm follows the Tomasi/Kanade approach <ref> [55] </ref> and reconstructs directly from many images rather than fusing few-frame reconstructions 9 10 . <p> The algorithm presented here is guaranteed to work well in its domain. We also argued in [35] that to achieve the best reconstructions over a broad range of situations one one must use a variety of algorithms. For example, the Tomasi/Kanade approach <ref> [55] </ref> works for sequences where the 3D scene is compact. Standard two-frame algorithms work well when the 3D scene is extended in depth and the camera translations are large 12 [35, 38, 36, 37]. <p> By treating specially the structure component affected by this ambiguity, the algorithm obtains near-optimal accuracy. Its other important ingredients include: a generalization of the technique of [21] for eliminating the first-order effects of camera rotations; and a generalization of the factorization method of <ref> [55] </ref>, which we use to recover the translations and depths. <p> = ffi hh 0 1=2 N F 1 Then E (~; T ) Trace (D CR D T CR ); (8) and the covariances of D CH , D CR are proportional to the identity: D h h 0 E D h h 0 E As in the Tomasi/Kanade approach <ref> [55] </ref>, our algorithm minimizes (8) approximately by solving for ~ i , T h x;y;z in two stages. Step 2b1: Computing the Leading Singular Vectors of D CH . The first stage computes the best rank-three approximation to D CH . <p> Also, in minimizing over U 0 , it in effect treats AU 0 as white over a range of U 0 , whereas this quantity can be (approximately) white only at a single value for U 0 . Lastly, as in <ref> [55] </ref>, this Step is based on a prior computation of A 1;2;3 rather than on the data directly. It is the second half of a two-stage solution, and it freezes in the bias introduced by the first stage's partial neglect of information 22 . <p> ERRORS Iteration 1 Iteration 2 Converged Improved MLE Mean Depth 2.411 5.276 5.377 2.656 1.930 Translation 0.119 0.207 0.209 0.124 0.101 Rotation 1.881 0.383 1.426 0.436 0.249 Table 4: Experiment 6: depth and motion errors. it to the Tomasi/Kanade approach <ref> [55] </ref>, and Experiment 11 demonstrates that the algorithm has no difficulties with planar scenes. 3.4.1 Experiment 6 motion results averaged over trials. For this experiment, the small-translation assumption holds to a very good approximation, and our algorithm's initial estimates are close to the MLEs 30 . <p> On the other hand, our experiments show that the two-frame global minimum is not always correct and that our multi-frame approach is much more accurate and reliable within its intended domain. 3.4.6 Experiment 10 We have also compared our algorithm to the Tomasi/Kanade approach <ref> [55] </ref> on sequences where the camera projection was approximately linear (scaled orthographic). For these experiments, the data does not contain enough information to determine the constant component of the inverse depths reliably|or, correspondingly, the overall average depth. Neither our algorithm nor the Tomasi/Kanade algorithm can recover the full structure.
