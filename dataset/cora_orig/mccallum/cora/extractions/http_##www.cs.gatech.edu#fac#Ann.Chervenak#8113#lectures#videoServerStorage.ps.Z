Reference-contexts: 30 per second Typical movie length 100 minutes Typical movie capacity 2.2 gigabytes Locality of accesses Zipf's Law Distribution Table 1: Summary of workload characteristics for video service when the compression scheme is MPEG-II with a target data rate of 3 megabits/second per stream. evidence to support our workload characterization <ref> [1] </ref>. This included predicted sizes for video objects and the throughput required per video stream for typical compression schemes; an estimate of locality of requests based on video store rental patterns; and typical user population sizes and response time constraints based on a survey of existing and proposed video servers. <p> We have shown <ref> [1] </ref> that one example of movie rental history approximately matches a Zipf's Law distribution. <p> bandwidth of 60 megabytes per second. 8.2.1 Performance of the Exabyte EXB120 Library axis shows the number of streams serviced by the tape library when 95% of requests must be serviced within an hour. (We chose such a long response time constraint because tape libraries have very long access times <ref> [1] </ref>.) The horizontal axis shows the percentage of the total of 1000 movies that are stored on tape, with the remainder of the movies stored on disk.

Reference-contexts: The first is to build the server entirely out of magnetic disks. Disk-based systems fall into two categories: disk arrays and disk farms. Disk arrays (RAIDs <ref> [2] </ref>) include specialized software and/or hardware controllers that stripe data among disks and maintain parity information.
