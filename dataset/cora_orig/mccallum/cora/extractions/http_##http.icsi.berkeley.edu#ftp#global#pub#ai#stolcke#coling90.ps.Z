Reference-contexts: This is considered undesirable from a metatheoretical point of view since it apparently introduces ambiguity and redundancy. A different view may be derived from the notion of radial categories as it arises in human categorization behavior <ref> (Lakoff, 1986) </ref>. The sentences to be accounted for are apparently clustered around a small number of constructions (or rules). These constructions, however, are not completely unrelated; rather they are linked to each other by those special cases where more than one rule overlap.

Reference-contexts: At a more abstract level, syntagmatic proximity can be viewed as symbolizing conceptual relatedness <ref> (Langacker 1985) </ref>. Hence the frame unit at the conceptual level corresponds (prototypically) to a clause unit at the syntactic level. Gapping constructions relate not just the fillers of the roles in a single frame but also the various fillers of the same role in different frames.
