Abstract: We prove (for fixed k) that at least 1 k1 ( n 2 ) O(n) equality tests and no more than 2 k ( n compared to known results. We give tighter bounds for k = 3. 1 Introduction

Reference-contexts: We need a lower bound on the number of probes for which the information remains nonconclusive. It is implied by the following result: 7 Fact 7 Consequence of Turan's theorem <ref> [1, p. 293] </ref>. Let t q (n) = ( n 2 ) i=0 ( n i 2 ), where n i = b n+i q c. Every graph with n vertices and more than t k1 (n) edges contains a k-clique.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction When given n elements it is often possible to sort them according to bit string representation and hence decide which elements are identical in time O (n log n). However, Campbell and McNeill <ref> [2] </ref> mention applications, where an equivalence relation is available, but it can not be extended to a total order on the bit representation. We mention one of their many examples. <p> This result determines the fraction of pairs that must be compared in the worst case up to 3 12 = 1 For general k the literature contains a single result, C (k; n) 2b n k cn <ref> [2] </ref>. We have improved this result by almost a factor 2, and obtain C (k; n) (1 + b n k c)n. We have also found a general lower bound.

Reference-contexts: Earlier special results have focused on determining a majority element, and the exact complexity E (d n+1 2 e; n) = C (d n+1 2 (n 1)c was found independently by several people <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. The interest in deciding the existence of a majority element was motivated by the design of fault tolerant computer sys tems where a majority of single processors must agree on the output [6]. The linear result is also interesting in a model where the elements are ordered [5].

In a restricted version of the majority problem, it is known in advance that there are precisely two distinct equivalence classes.

Reference-contexts: It requires and suffices to make n B (n) equality tests to find a representative of the larger class, when n is odd (B (n) denotes the number of ones in the binary representation of n) <ref> [7] </ref>. We have divided our results into two sections.
