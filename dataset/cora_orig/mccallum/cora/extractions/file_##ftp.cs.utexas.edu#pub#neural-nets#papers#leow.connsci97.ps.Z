Abstract: VISOR is a large connectionist system that shows how visual schemas can be learned, represented, and used through mechanisms natural to neural networks. Processing in VISOR is based on cooperation, competition, and parallel bottom-up and top-down activation of schema representations. Simulations show that VISOR is robust against noise and variations in the inputs and parameters. It can indicate the confidence of its analysis, pay attention to important minor differences, and use context to recognize ambiguous objects. Experiments also suggest that the representation and learning are stable, and its behavior is consistent with human processes such as priming, perceptual reversal, and circular reaction in learning. The schema mechanisms of VISOR can serve as a starting point for building robust high-level vision systems, and perhaps for schema-based motor control and natural language processing systems as well.

Reference-contexts: The distributed activity pattern over the shape feature cells represents the shape of the attended component in terms of attributes such as length, breadth, closure, vertical tilt, horizontal tilt, degree of expansion, and curvature <ref> (Biederman 1987b) </ref>. These attributes are measured relative to the object's main axis, and are thus invariant with respect to the object's orientation. Each attribute is represented by a set of feature cells that are maximally sensitive to different ranges of values (e.g., small, medium, large).

Reference-contexts: If the focused object is a region with approximately uniform texture but no specific shape (such as a grass patch), the texture of the region is extracted and encoded in the texture feature cells. Each of these cells corresponds to the output of a filter channel <ref> (Bovik et al. 1987) </ref> that is maximally sensitive to a particular type of texture. The Relative Position Maps (RPMs) represent the position of the attended component at two different scales. At the scale level of individual objects, the RPM encodes the position of the component relative to the entire object.

Reference-contexts: This signal suppresses the knife schema-net's activation so that a different schema-net can become most active and correct learning can proceed as in the first case. In other words, the punishment signal plays a similar role as the mismatch-reset signal in the ART network <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg 1987) </ref>. It tells the Schema Module to find a different schema-net for the spoon without specifying which one. The same process takes place when VISOR learns to encode a scene schema. <p> Not all learning algorithms are stable. For example, it has been shown that in competitive learning (Rumelhart and Zipser 1985), the categories may keep switching units indefinitely and the system may never settle to a fixed categorization (Grossberg 1976). Such instability is a result of the so-called stability-plasticity dilemma <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg 1987) </ref>: on one hand, the network should be plastic enough so that it can learn to encode new categories; on the other, what it has already learned should not be erased. <p> One way to achieve LTM stability is to change only those weights that encode the category of the current input. This strategy is adopted in the ART network <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg 1987) </ref> as well as in VISOR. To show that VISOR's encoding of schemas is indeed stable, three objects, spoon, knife, and hammer, were presented repeatedly, in that order, to VISOR to learn. Fig. 13 shows the schema activations over the course of learning. <p> Similarly in subsequent presentations, only the correct schema-nets were allowed to encode the current inputs, and they eventually became very good encodings of the spoon, knife, and the hammer. VISOR's learning strategy is similar to that of the ART network <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg 1987) </ref>. In ART, when an input activates a wrong encoding unit, the top-down pattern generated from the encoding unit will not match the bottom-up input pattern.

Reference-contexts: One way to ensure STM stability is to connect the network in such a way that it satisfies the Cohen-Grossberg stability condition <ref> (Cohen and Grossberg 1983) </ref>. Since the recurrent connections in VISOR are highly structured, it is difficult to prove that the network satisfies this condition.

Reference-contexts: However, although such schema system implementations have been proposed (Arbib 1989; Hinton 1990), and there are systems that simulate parts of the process such as hierarchical structures (Feldman 1985; Zemel et al. 1990), cooperation and competition (Rumelhart et al. 1986b), and dynamic bindings <ref> (Hummel and Biederman 1992) </ref>, no complete visual schema systems have been built so far on neural networks. The main motivation for neural network schema systems, besides an elegant implementation of the cooperative and competitive processes, is that several powerful learning mechanisms exists for neural networks.

Reference-contexts: The target output was 1 for the output unit that represented the input object, and 0 for the other units. Backpropagation training turned out to be very sensitive to the learning rate, momentum, and initial connection weights <ref> (cf. Kolen and Pollack 1990) </ref>. Many different combinations of parameters were tried before finding one set that produced satisfactory training results (with learning rate = 0:5, momentum = 0:1, and total sum-squared error &lt; 0:1). It took slightly more than 100 presentations of each object to train the network.

Reference-contexts: VISOR makes a decision preferring small shifts suggested by highly-active schemas <ref> (see Leow 1994 for details) </ref>. Consider, for example, how VISOR learned to encode the hammer as part of the training described in Section 4.1. From the first presentation of the hammer, an initially random schema started to encode the spatial structure of the hammer. <p> Especially Grossberg's model seems compatible with VISOR and could possibly be adapted to function in the LLVM <ref> (Leow 1994) </ref>. Such a combined model would make it possible to study how feedback from the schema hierarchy affects segmentation and attention. Also, VISOR does not currently include mechanisms for dealing with occluded objects. However, VISOR can recognize objects with missing parts, which is a good starting point. <p> The weight modification is most easily expressed in terms of two weight values on a single connection: W ixj at the unit b ix receiving the connections, and X ixj at the source unit A j . Both weights are adapted through a process that normalizes the total weights <ref> (Leow 1994) </ref>: d W ixj = c ix W ixj i # 33 d X ixj = c ix X ixj - # where W and X should be larger than 1, such as 10. Initially, the weights are assumed to be bounded between 0 and 1. <p> Initially, the weights have small random positive values. During the learning process, they are modified by a process that normalizes the total weights: d w ix = w ix y;- Equation 12 normalizes the total weight P x; w ix to 1 <ref> (Leow 1994) </ref>. If all the n components of the schema appear with the same probabilities, then the weights w ix representing these components will have approximately the value 1=n, while other weights have 0 values. <p> Feedback Weights m ix The schema's output unit A i also sends feedback connections to its SAM units a ix . The weights m ix of these connections are modified by a process that polarizes the weights towards 0 or 1 <ref> (Leow 1994) </ref>: dt where fl m is the decay rate, typically much smaller than 1, such as 0.1. Initially, the weights have small positive random values.

Reference-contexts: These characteristics can very naturally be implemented in neural networks. However, although such schema system implementations have been proposed (Arbib 1989; Hinton 1990), and there are systems that simulate parts of the process such as hierarchical structures (Feldman 1985; Zemel et al. 1990), cooperation and competition <ref> (Rumelhart et al. 1986b) </ref>, and dynamic bindings (Hummel and Biederman 1992), no complete visual schema systems have been built so far on neural networks.

Reference-contexts: As learning progresses and weights are modified, the category encoded by the unit may change. The network's LTM is said to be stable if each unit eventually settles to encode a fixed category. Not all learning algorithms are stable. For example, it has been shown that in competitive learning <ref> (Rumelhart and Zipser 1985) </ref>, the categories may keep switching units indefinitely and the system may never settle to a fixed categorization (Grossberg 1976).
