Abstract: In a previous paper [1], we proposed and analyzed a timeout scheme to alleviate network congestion and thus improve the throughput for a wormhole routing network in local area network (LAN) environments. This timeout scheme was proved to be effective, but the optimal timeout value varies with packet size, propagation delay, and other network parameters. To tune the timeout value automatically, two dynamic timeout methods are presented in this paper. The first method, called "Immediate Timeout Or Wait" (ITOW), compares the costs for timeout and waiting. Thus, it decides to reject a worm immediately or to allow the worm to wait until the timeout occurs. The second method, called "Cost Equilibrium Point" (CEP), sets the timeout value to the point where the timeout and waiting costs are the same, thereby determining the timeout value automatically. From simulation, the results show that the first method simplifies the choice of the timeout value and the second method performs well if a cost factor for timeout is given properly. Both methods improve the network throughput significantly.

Reference-contexts: This degrades the achievable network throughput. To overcome this throughput limitation, a deterministic timeout scheme was proposed in our earlier paper <ref> [1] </ref>. Whenever a worm head reaches a switch, a timer starts counting how long this worm resides at this switch while waiting for its outgoing link to become available (at which time it advances to the next switch or host node).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wormhole routing is a simple, low-cost switching scheme often used for supercomputer interconnections. It has the merits of low latency, low cost, and simple implementation. Recently wormhole routing has been used as the switching scheme for Local area networks (LANs). One such effort is Myricom's Myrinet <ref> [2] </ref>, which has been adopted as the LAN infrastructure for the Supercomputer SuperNet (SSN), a research project being conducted at UCLA, JPL and Aerospace Corp. [3, 4]. 1.1 Wormhole Routing Wormhole routing was developed from the earlier idea of cut-through switching [5], and was first introduced in [6]. <p> With wormhole routing, deadlocks are possible unless a deadlock-free routing strategy is employed. We measure packet length by flits, which is the amount of data that can be transmitted in one time unit. For example, the 640Mbps Myrinet <ref> [2] </ref> has one byte per flit lasting 12.5ns. A survey of wormhole routing can be found in [7]. 1.2 Timeout Reset Wormhole routing exhibits very low network latency through its use of cut-through switching [5].
