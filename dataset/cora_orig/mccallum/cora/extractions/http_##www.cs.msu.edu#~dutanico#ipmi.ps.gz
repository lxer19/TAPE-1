Abstract: An improvement of the Active Shape procedure introduced by Cootes and Taylor is presented. The new automated brain segmentation and interpretation approach incorporates a priori knowledge about neuroanatomic structures and their specific structural relationships to provide robust segmentation and labeling. The method was trained in 8 MR brain images and tested in 19 brain images by comparison to observer-defined independent standards. Neuroanatomic structures in all images from the test set were successfully identified. The presented method is applicable to virtually any task in volving deformable shape analysis.

Reference-contexts: Signed area error, labeling error and border positioning error were used as measures for comparing the observer-defined and computer-determined contours of neuroanatomic structures. The calculated indices were identical to those previously employed in <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 Results The PDM approach to brain image segmentation and interpretation correctly interpreted the brain neuroanatomic structures in all images from the test set. Fig. 2 shows the observer-traced and computer-detected contours. <p> Compared to our previously-reported brain image segmentation and interpretation approach <ref> [3] </ref>, our new method described here offers comparable segmentation and interpretation performance while the speed of the interpretation process has increased thirty times.
