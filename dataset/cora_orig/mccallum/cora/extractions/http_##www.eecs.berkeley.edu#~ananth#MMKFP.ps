Abstract: We view a ./M/K node having K exponential servers of service rate as a map on the space of stationary ergodic arrival processes of rate , &lt; K. It is well known that the Poisson process of rate is a fixed point of this map. We prove there is no other fixed point.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4 we introduce a metric on the space of point processes of rate relative to a Poisson process of rate . This metric was motivated by a similar metric introduced in Anantharam, <ref> [1] </ref>, to study the analogous problem for quasireversible queues in discrete time; the metric in [1] is a member of a family of generalizations of Ornstein's d-metric, [10], introduced by Gray, Neuhoff and Shields, [7]. <p> In Section 4 we introduce a metric on the space of point processes of rate relative to a Poisson process of rate .

We derive several basic properties of this metric, which are analogous to properties of the metrics in [7] derived in [7] and the textbook of Gray, [6]. <p> It follows that N e is an (M; M) valued random variable on (; F ; P; f t g) commuting with the shifts, i.e. it is a point process. The rate of N e is E <ref> [N e (0; 1] </ref>] by definition; we first verify that this is . To see this, note that E [N e (0; 1]] = E [N d (0; 1]]E 0 [1 (x 1 n ; t d by the definition of Palm probability, see [2], eqn. (2.2.4). <p> The rate of N e is E <ref> [N e (0; 1] </ref>] by definition; we first verify that this is .

Since E [N d (0; 1]] = , we need to verify that the second term on the right is =. <p> The rate of N z is determined by writing E <ref> [N z (0; 1] </ref>] = E [N d (0; 1]]E 0 [1 (z 1 n &gt; 0)] and then arguing exactly as in Theorem 2 to conclude that E 0 [1 (z 1 0 ffi t d n + N Y equals E 0 [N Y n ]. <p> The rate of N z is determined by writing E [N z (0; 1]] = E <ref> [N d (0; 1] </ref>]E 0 [1 (z 1 n &gt; 0)] and then arguing exactly as in Theorem 2 to conclude that E 0 [1 (z 1 0 ffi t d n + N Y equals E 0 [N Y n ]. <p> <ref> [N z (0; 1] </ref>] = E [N d (0; 1]]E 0 [1 (z 1 n &gt; 0)] and then arguing exactly as in Theorem 2 to conclude that E 0 [1 (z 1 0 ffi t d n + N Y equals E 0 [N Y n ]. Thus E [N z (0; 1]] =E 0 [N Y = (2= ( a ; a)) (5:2) The rate of N y is similarly computed to be E [N y (0; 1]] = E 0 [1 (~x 1;Y n + min (x 1;B n ) 0 ffi t d n ; N B <p> Thus E [N z (0; 1]] =E 0 [N Y = (2= ( a ; a)) (5:2) The rate of N y is similarly computed to be E <ref> [N y (0; 1] </ref>] = E 0 [1 (~x 1;Y n + min (x 1;B n ) 0 ffi t d n ; N B = E 0 [N Y 0 ffi t d n ; N R 0 ffi t d n ; N B where the second equality comes <p> N ~e ) is T ( a ) (resp. T (-a )). Further, since points in N y correspond to points in both N e and N ~e it is seen by definition that (T ( a ); T (-a )) 2= 0 = 2= 1=E <ref> [N y (0; 1] </ref>] Comparing with (5.2) and (5.3), we see that to establish the claim it suffices to prove that E 0 [N Y 0 + min (x 0 ; N R 1;R 0 )] or equivalently that 0 &lt; E 0 [ min (x 0 ; N R 1;R <p> One defines the point processes N e , N ~e , N z and N y as in Theorem 4, with the obvious change in indicator conditions. Now the Palm theory gives E <ref> [N z (0; 1] </ref>] = E [N d (0; 1]]E 0 [1 (z 1 n k 0 ffi t d )] : One can argue exactly as in Theorem 2 to conclude that E 0 [1 (z 1 0 ffi t d n + N Y equals E 0 [N Y <p> One defines the point processes N e , N ~e , N z and N y as in Theorem 4, with the obvious change in indicator conditions.

Reference-contexts: For a discussion of the difficulty here, see the concluding remarks. We will first discuss fixed points of the input output map of a ./M/1 node. In Section 2 we review some basics of the theory of stationary point processes following Baccelli and Bremaud, <ref> [2] </ref>, and Resnick, [12]. We also introduce the sample spaces on which we will work. <p> The proof is a version of the Loynes' scheme, see Loynes, [9], Baccelli and Bremaud, <ref> [2] </ref>, and Walrand, [15] for discussions of this kind of construction. This construction serves to define the input output map of a ./M/1 node of service rate as a map on stationary ergodic arrival processes of rate , 0 &lt; &lt; . <p> Some concluding remarks are made in Section 8. 2. Preliminaries In this section we recall some basic concepts from the theory of stationary point processes. The development and notation closely follows the discussion in <ref> [2] </ref>. Statements regarding the topology and measurable structure of the spaces we consider are mostly proved in [12], Chapter 3. Let (R; B) denote the real numbers with the Borel -field. <p> This space admits a P 0 preserving transformation given by the restriction of t d 1 . to 0 . For the development of Palm theory, see <ref> [2] </ref>. 3. Existence and uniqueness of stationary regime It is well known that one can uniquely specify the input output map of a ./M/1 node of service rate as a map on M e S () when 0 &lt; &lt; . <p> This is a consequence of the existence and uniqueness results for the Loynes problem, [9] for this queue, and falls out of the more general results for G/G/1 queues, see [9], <ref> [2] </ref> and [15], Chapter 7 for discussion of these results. Since we need the details of the construction, we briefly recapitulate it in our setup. <p> The P 0 - a.s. finiteness of x 1 0 is argued easily from the rate condition &lt; . First note that the f t g ergodicity of P implies the ergodicity of P 0 , see <ref> [2] </ref>, statement (8.2.1). Since fx 1 0 = 1g is a invariant event, it has P 0 probability 0 or 1. Thus to show x 1 0 is P 0 - a.s. finite it suffices to prove that P 0 (x 1 0 = 1) &lt; 1. <p> Proof : The sequence Z n+1 = 1 (x 1 0 ffi t d n + N a (t d n+1 ] &gt; 0) , n 2 Z, is easily verified to be a sequence of f0; 1g valued marks on the point process N , see <ref> [2] </ref>, Section 1.3 for a discussion of marked point processes. It follows that N e is an (M; M) valued random variable on (; F ; P; f t g) commuting with the shifts, i.e. it is a point process. <p> To see this, note that E [N e (0; 1]] = E [N d (0; 1]]E 0 [1 (x 1 n ; t d by the definition of Palm probability, see <ref> [2] </ref>, eqn. (2.2.4). Since E [N d (0; 1]] = , we need to verify that the second term on the right is =.

In this paper we prove that Poisson processes are the only stationary ergodic fixed points of ./M/K nodes, K &lt; 1.
