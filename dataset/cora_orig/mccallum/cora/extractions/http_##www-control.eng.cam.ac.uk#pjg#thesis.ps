Reference-contexts: As seen in the previous section, an upper bound on the error for weighted balanced truncation is much more difficult to obtain than for the unweighted case. The same is true for weighted and unweighted Hankel norm approximation. Anderson <ref> [2] </ref> derives a bound for weighted Hankel norm approximations which is proportional to the unweighted error. The value of the factor of proportionality is dependent solely on the weighting functions.

Reference-contexts: A comprehensive list of references may be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The properties of inner functions are discussed further in Section 2.7.1. 2.5 Coprime Factorisations As with inner functions, coprime factorisations are used extensively in both H 1 synthesis [63, 89] and model approximation <ref> [3, 32, 58, 60, 64, 65, 67, 72] </ref>. A particular advantage of such multiplicative decompositions for model approximation is the stability of the two coprime factors. <p> This form of realisation greatly reduces both computational and memory requirements. The problem of reducing complexity via reducing the state-dimension has received much attention over the last 30 years. See <ref> [3, 29, 94] </ref> for a comprehensive list of references. However, until recently, few of these approaches considered the fundamental relationship between the model reduction problem and the controller synthesis problem. <p> In this dissertation we investigate this relationship and extend current procedures by deriving sufficient conditions for reduced order controllers to satisfy a prespecified closed loop performance. The design of reduced order controllers for high order plants may be divided into three categories <ref> [3] </ref>: direct design via optimisation of controller parameters; model reduction followed by the design of a low order controller using the reduced order model; and design of a high order controller from the high order model, followed by reduction of the high order controller. <p> Since any parameter optimisation tends to be non-convex there is no guarantee that a global optimal solution will be attained. There is a fundamental relationship between the model reduction problem and the controller design problem <ref> [3, 17, 94, 96] </ref>. Since model reduction followed by the design of a low order controller using the reduced order model neglects to take this relationship into account it is generally considered an unsatisfactory approach. <p> Fraction approaches to model reduction have received much attention in the literature. The procedure presented next is variously called fractional balanced reduction by Meyer [67] and coprime 3.3 Frequency Weighted Approximation 28 factor model reduction by Liu and Anderson <ref> [58, 3] </ref> and McFarlane et al. [63, 64, 65]. It is closely related to the Riccati balanced model reduction of Jonckheere and Silverman [49]. Since the factors in a fractional representation are stable by construction, they allow use of the previous reduction techniques without the additive decomposition suggested above. <p> This property may be exploited to derive stability preservation results in terms of the Hankel singular values of h ~ N ~ M . 3.3 Frequency Weighted Approximation Controller reduction is a distinct problem from standard open loop model approximation as discussed in the preceding section. As argued in <ref> [3] </ref>, if rationally based, controller reduction schemes must take account of the plant to which the controller is ultimately to be connected. The final objective is, after all, to control the closed loop characteristics such that they meet some performance criteria. <p> 0 Q R Therefore, since R is stable for all stabilising K 0 , and is stable by design, from Lemma 3.3.5 we have that kR 11 k 1 &lt; 1 ) F u (R; ) 2 RH 1 3.4 Performance Considerations 34 This reduces to the well known condition <ref> [3, 17] </ref>, k [I P 22 K 0 ] 1 P 22 [K K 0 ]k 1 &lt; 1 ) F l (P; K) 2 RH 1 : Therefore, letting W i = I and W o = [I P 22 K 0 ] 1 P 22 in either the weighted

A difficulty encountered with this type of formulation is that the computational requirements generally increase rapidly as a function of the state dimension [7]. Hence it is desirable to keep the state-dimension as low as possible. This desire motivates the development of approximation techniques for LPV models. We begin this chapter by defining LPV systems in Section 6.2. <p> This class of systems has been studied by Becker <ref> [7] </ref> for the purpose of controller synthesis. We adopt a similar notation to Becker, and begin by stipulating conditions which guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the class of LPV models to be considered. Firstly we define F P , the set of all admissible parameter trajectories. <p> !

We also require the notions of Q-stabilisability and Q-detectability .

Reference-contexts: That is, the robustness of the design to unmodeled dynamics. One such figure of merit is expressed in terms of the H 1 norm of the closed loop transfer function. (See Fran-cis [23] or Doyle et al. <ref> [14] </ref> for an introduction to the H 1 control problem.) Given a linear, time invariant, plant model P , the standard suboptimal H 1 control problem is to design a stabilising controller such that the H 1 norm of the closed loop transfer function is less than some prespecified performance level <p> Controllers satisfying the H 1 suboptimal control problem are said to be (P; fl)-admissible. A drawback of present H 1 design procedures (see for instance <ref> [14, 38, 24, 26] </ref>) is that the order of resulting (P; fl)-admissible controllers is typically of the same order as the model. 1.2 Synthesis of Reduced Order Controllers 2 Since models for physical systems are often of high order, controllers designed to satisfy the H 1 suboptimal control problem via these <p> output Gw will be bounded and kGk 1 = sup fkGwk 2 g : Therefore, if we interpret w as a (bounded energy) disturbance signal, kGk 1 &lt; fl implies a certain level of disturbance attenuation. 2.4 Inner Functions Inner transfer functions are used extensively in both H 1 synthesis <ref> [14] </ref> and model approxi mation [34, 36, 52]. Central to the approximation techniques of Glover [34, 36] is the ability to calculate an approximation which has an all-pass error. This all-pass characteristic leads to approximants which are optimal in the Hankel norm. <p> Similarly, the error bound for balanced truncation approximation may be derived using an all-pass dilation procedure. (Optimal Hankel norm and balanced truncation approximations will be reviewed in more detail in Chapter 3.) Further, inner functions are essential to the H 1 controller design techniques of Doyle et al. <ref> [14] </ref>. In [14] it is shown, via a change of variable, that the general output feedback problem may be transformed to an equivalent, but simpler problem, which is related to the original by an inner function. Every solution to the simplified problem is also a solution to the original problem. <p> Similarly, the error bound for balanced truncation approximation may be derived using an all-pass dilation procedure. (Optimal Hankel norm and balanced truncation approximations will be reviewed in more detail in Chapter 3.) Further, inner functions are essential to the H 1 controller design techniques of Doyle et al. <ref> [14] </ref>. In [14] it is shown, via a change of variable, that the general output feedback problem may be transformed to an equivalent, but simpler problem, which is related to the original by an inner function. Every solution to the simplified problem is also a solution to the original problem. <p> Definition 2.4.2 A stable, p fi m transfer function G, where p m, is said to be co-inner if GG ~ = I. The following state space results are well known <ref> [14, 34, 63] </ref>. Lemma 2.4.3 Assume G is a stable, p fi m (p m) transfer function with minimal realisa-tion (A; B; C; D) and observability Gramian Q = Q 0 &gt; 0 satisfying equation (2.5). <p> The formulae are also considerable simpler if D 11 = 0. A derivation for this case may be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. Relaxing the rank assumptions on D 12 and D 21 in (A3) leads to singular control problems. The LMI based solution reviewed in Section 3.4.2 may be employed to solve such singular problems. <p> To simplify the exposition, as in <ref> [14] </ref> throughout this section we make the following additional assumptions on the generalised plant P . (A6) D 11 = 0. 12 C 1 = 0 and B 1 D 0 (A8) fl = 1. 4.7 Equivalence of Approaches 59 Assumptions (A6)-(A8) greatly simplify the controller formulae and allow K a <p> The subscript notation is taken from <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> : Then (a) N is inner.

Of particular importance are those techniques which give conditions for reduced order controllers to be stabilising, and if so, the associated degradation of closed loop performance.

Reference-contexts: We achieve this goal by incorporating information about the closed loop into frequency weights and then undertaking frequency weighted model reduction. Direct design procedures <ref> [28, 46, 47, 48, 61] </ref> are important since unlike the other two paths they allow the designer to impose not only a degree constraint on the solution but also a specific structure. This is particularly useful if switching is required between several controllers [45].

Reference-contexts: This form of realisation greatly reduces both computational and memory requirements. The problem of reducing complexity via reducing the state-dimension has received much attention over the last 30 years. See <ref> [3, 29, 94] </ref> for a comprehensive list of references. However, until recently, few of these approaches considered the fundamental relationship between the model reduction problem and the controller synthesis problem. <p> This elimination may be undertaken by a number of techniques <ref> [8, 12, 29] </ref>. Modal reduction is closely related to truncation of a partial fraction expansion of a given transfer function. This may be represented in state space form as a truncation of a Jordan form realisation [94].

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, they may equally be interpreted in a controller reduction framework. We concentrate on this interpretation. First we define what is meant by the graph of a transfer matrix and the gap between two transfer matrices. (For a more detailed discussion see <ref> [31, 77, 90] </ref>.) Definition 3.4.1 The graph of a transfer matrix K is the set of all possible bounded input/output pairs, G (K) = u # " U v : v 2 H 2 where K = U V 1 is a right coprime factorisation of K and y = Ku. <p> Note that the gap is the maximum of two directed gaps which are computable if a normalised coprime factorisation is used to define the graph (see <ref> [30, 31] </ref>).

Then the next theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition for H (G; K) to be stable.

Reference-contexts: The properties of inner functions are discussed further in Section 2.7.1. 2.5 Coprime Factorisations As with inner functions, coprime factorisations are used extensively in both H 1 synthesis [63, 89] and model approximation <ref> [3, 32, 58, 60, 64, 65, 67, 72] </ref>. A particular advantage of such multiplicative decompositions for model approximation is the stability of the two coprime factors. <p> This problem has been tackled by, amongst others, McFarlane et al. [63, 64, 65] using coprime factor approximation, by Mustafa [69, 70] using H 1 -balanced truncation, and by Georgiou and Smith <ref> [32] </ref> and Qui and Davidson [77] for approximation in the gap metric. A priori bounds on the degradation in closed loop performance are computable for each of these approaches. <p> A priori bounds on the degradation in closed loop performance are computable for each of these approaches.

Appropriate bounds were originally derived by Georgiou and Smith <ref> [32] </ref>. However, the following bounds, derived by Vinnicombe in his work on the --gap [90] are tighter.

Reference-contexts: There are numerous algorithms which may be employed to perform this reduction, including Pade approximation [83, 74], balanced truncation [68, 75], and optimal Hankel norm approximation <ref> [34, 36] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The first uses the state space matrices of to introduce state cancellations into the controller state-space which may be truncated to give a reduced order controller. The second method uses a constrained linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimisation approach. Introducing State Cancellations In <ref> [41] </ref>, Gu et al. propose a procedure to select so as to introduce unobservable modes into K = F l (K a ; ). These unobservable modes may then be truncated to obtain a reduced order (P; fl)-admissible controller. <p> K is therefore a reduced order (P; fl)-admissible controller. There are two general drawbacks to the state cancellation approach. Firstly, there is no systematic method of choosing matrices which a priori satisfy all of the required conditions.

Reference-contexts: The assumption being that by neglecting parameters which contribute little to the fundamental behaviour of the system a suitable reduced order model may be obtained. Such essential parameters may include time moments, Markov parameters and eigenvalues. The methods of Pade [83] and Routh <ref> [44] </ref> fall into this category. Although these techniques tend to be computationally very simple, approximation by such methods tends to be somewhat ad hoc.

Reference-contexts: For these strategies to be successful real time information about the plant operating point is required to enable accurate switching/scheduling to take place. (A comparison of the switching and scheduling strategies for an advanced fighter aircraft is given by Hyde <ref> [45] </ref>.) Unfortunately, although the switched/scheduled controllers are guaranteed to meet performance specifications at each of the frozen design points, there is no guarantee of meeting performance requirements at intermediate points. <p> In addition, make the standard assumption that p 1 m 2 and m 1 p 2 . P (s) is called the generalised plant. It includes both the actual plant to be controlled and any frequency dependent weights used in the controller synthesis process <ref> [45, 63] </ref>. The standard suboptimal H 1 control problem is to find all stabilising controllers for the gener-alised plant, P , such that the H 1 norm of the closed loop transfer function, T zw = F l (P; K), is less than some prespecified performance level fl &gt; 0. <p> This leads to (possibly) lighter, smaller and cheaper control systems with quicker processing times. Further, since there are likely to be fewer hardware or software bugs, higher integrity can be expected. As argued by Hyde <ref> [45] </ref>, controller complexity may be measured in terms of the number of calculations required per unit time, the number of controller parameters required to be stored and updated, and by the size of the controller state-dimension. <p> Direct design procedures [28, 46, 47, 48, 61] are important since unlike the other two paths they allow the designer to impose not only a degree constraint on the solution but also a specific structure. This is particularly useful if switching is required between several controllers <ref> [45] </ref>. However, the techniques employed are slightly ad-hoc since it is often not clear what constitutes an appropriate structure to impose, nor what constitutes an appropriate degree constraint. Further, the selection of a suitable initial guess for any parameter optimi-sation is not often straightforward. <p> that a controller whose Nyquist plot satisfies (F l (P (j!); K (j!))) &lt; fl 8! will stabilise the closed loop. 5.4 Example Consider the interconnection shown in Figure 5.2 where G is the SISO pitch loop (including performance weights) of the Generic VSTOL Aircraft Model (GVAM) as studied in <ref> [45] </ref>. Here we will compare the performance of standard frequency weighted model reduction to the proposed graphical approach. 5.4 Example 75 h h ? ? - w 2 w 1 z 1 = y K The model describes the GVAM in hover mode with reaction jets controlling the pitch attitude. <p> Rather, more sophisticated models (and controller synthesis techniques) are required. One such technique which has received much attention in recent years is that of gain scheduling <ref> [45, 66, 84, 85, 82, 86] </ref>. The idea is to derive LTI models at each of several operating points which cover the range of operation of the plant. An LTI controller may then be designed to meet LTI performance specifications at each of these points. <p> The performance weights are selected to emphasise objectives such as disturbance attenuation at low frequency and robustness to modeling uncertainty. Selection of appropriate weights is non-trivial and often involves a certain amount of iteration. For a more detailed discussion on weight selection see <ref> [45, 63] </ref>. Here we assume that design objectives have been prespecified and that all (P; fl)-admissible controllers satisfy the required objectives. Hence we will concentrate purely on the problem of reducing controller complexity by designing low-order (P; fl)-admissible controllers. The third example considers reducing the order of LPV controllers.

For such a setup the reduced order h i is guaranteed to be normalised and possess Hankel singular values identical to the first k Hankel singular values of h i [67].

Reference-contexts: Consequently a number of alternative reduction techniques, all employing balanced re-alisations (but aiming for good low frequency approximation) have been researched since Moore's initial work of 1981.

Reference-contexts: The third possible path, direct design, is to impose a degree constraint and structure on the controller and use parameter optimisation to obtain an acceptable performance. Extensive work has been carried out in this area by Hyland et al. [46, 47, 48] and Ly et al. <ref> [61] </ref>. This is particularly convenient if switching/scheduling is required between several controllers since the same structure may be imposed on the controller at each design point. <p> We achieve this goal by incorporating information about the closed loop into frequency weights and then undertaking frequency weighted model reduction. Direct design procedures <ref> [28, 46, 47, 48, 61] </ref> are important since unlike the other two paths they allow the designer to impose not only a degree constraint on the solution but also a specific structure. This is particularly useful if switching is required between several controllers [45].

Reference-contexts: Since such bounds play a central role in determining reduced stability margins and performance degradation when reduced order controllers are substituted for high order controllers <ref> [17, 69, 63, 34] </ref>, Hankel singular values are integral to the techniques of controller approximation. 2.3 Function Spaces In H 1 control the performance of a system is expressed in terms of the H 1 norm of the closed loop transfer function. <p> Definition 2.4.2 A stable, p fi m transfer function G, where p m, is said to be co-inner if GG ~ = I.

Lemma 2.4.3 Assume G is a stable, p fi m (p m) transfer function with minimal realisa-tion (A; B; C; D) and observability Gramian Q = Q 0 &gt; 0 satisfying equation (2.5). <p> If the input to an inner function has bounded energy then the output will be bounded by the same energy level. The properties of inner functions are discussed further in Section 2.7.1. 2.5 Coprime Factorisations As with inner functions, coprime factorisations are used extensively in both H 1 synthesis <ref> [63, 89] </ref> and model approximation [3, 32, 58, 60, 64, 65, 67, 72]. A particular advantage of such multiplicative decompositions for model approximation is the stability of the two coprime factors. <p> In addition, make the standard assumption that p 1 m 2 and m 1 p 2 . P (s) is called the generalised plant. It includes both the actual plant to be controlled and any frequency dependent weights used in the controller synthesis process <ref> [45, 63] </ref>. The standard suboptimal H 1 control problem is to find all stabilising controllers for the gener-alised plant, P , such that the H 1 norm of the closed loop transfer function, T zw = F l (P; K), is less than some prespecified performance level fl &gt; 0. <p> Fraction approaches to model reduction have received much attention in the literature. The procedure presented next is variously called fractional balanced reduction by Meyer [67] and coprime 3.3 Frequency Weighted Approximation 28 factor model reduction by Liu and Anderson [58, 3] and McFarlane et al. <ref> [63, 64, 65] </ref>. It is closely related to the Riccati balanced model reduction of Jonckheere and Silverman [49]. Since the factors in a fractional representation are stable by construction, they allow use of the previous reduction techniques without the additive decomposition suggested above. <p> Further, given that K is stabilising, it is possible to bound, a priori, the degradation in closed loop performance. This problem has been tackled by, amongst others, McFarlane et al. <ref> [63, 64, 65] </ref> using coprime factor approximation, by Mustafa [69, 70] using H 1 -balanced truncation, and by Georgiou and Smith [32] and Qui and Davidson [77] for approximation in the gap metric. A priori bounds on the degradation in closed loop performance are computable for each of these approaches. <p> The performance weights are selected to emphasise objectives such as disturbance attenuation at low frequency and robustness to modeling uncertainty. Selection of appropriate weights is non-trivial and often involves a certain amount of iteration. For a more detailed discussion on weight selection see <ref> [45, 63] </ref>. Here we assume that design objectives have been prespecified and that all (P; fl)-admissible controllers satisfy the required objectives. Hence we will concentrate purely on the problem of reducing controller complexity by designing low-order (P; fl)-admissible controllers. The third example considers reducing the order of LPV controllers.

Reference-contexts: selected to be close enough together, and that the switching/scheduling parameter should vary slowly, are satisfied, then it is reasonable to assume that satisfactory performance will be achieved across the whole operating range. (See the work of Shamma and Athens [84, 85], Sharuz and Behtash [82] and Meressi and Paden <ref> [66] </ref> for a detailed discussion of these stability and performance rules.) Given that it is possible to model a plant across its whole operating range by a linear parameter varying (LPV) model, much work has recently been directed towards exploiting linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques to design controllers which guarantee performance <p> Rather, more sophisticated models (and controller synthesis techniques) are required. One such technique which has received much attention in recent years is that of gain scheduling <ref> [45, 66, 84, 85, 82, 86] </ref>. The idea is to derive LTI models at each of several operating points which cover the range of operation of the plant. An LTI controller may then be designed to meet LTI performance specifications at each of these points.

Reference-contexts: There are numerous algorithms which may be employed to perform this reduction, including Pade approximation [83, 74], balanced truncation <ref> [68, 75] </ref>, and optimal Hankel norm approximation [34, 36]. However, although the low order controller is designed to perform well with the low order model, there is no guarantee that performance specifications will be met if it is connected to the high order model let alone the actual plant. <p> Obviously eigenvalues can therefore be used to give an indication of the controllability or observability of any particular mode. (For a more detailed discussion of this geometric interpretation see Moore <ref> [68] </ref> or Enns [17]). The eigenvalues of the product P Q are invariant under invertible state transformations and hence form a set of input-output invariants. <p> hence should be retained, depends heavily on the specific problem formulation and designer preference, while the lack of performance guarantee leads to a (possibly) time consuming trial and error approach. 3.2 Open Loop Approximation 24 The second category of approximation techniques covers such methods as modal reduction and balanced truncation <ref> [68] </ref>. The common idea is to transform any given realisation of G (s) into an appropriate, essentially unique, realisation, then truncate those parts of the new realisation considered to contribute least to system behaviour. <p> The contribution of such states to the overall system input-output response is considered to be negligible and hence they may be ignored without undue loss of accuracy. However, in general, a strongly controllable state may be weakly observable or vice versa. Moore <ref> [68] </ref> showed how this problem may be overcome by deriving a similarity transformation for stable systems such that the controllability and observability Gramians of the transformed co-ordinates are equal (or balanced). Taking the geometric view of Section 2.2.1, the semiaxes of the controllability and observability ellipsoids will be lined up. <p> Definition 3.2.2 ([68]) A transfer function G 2 RH 1 with minimal realisation (A; B; C; D) is balanced if its controllability and observability Gramians, P and Q respectively, satisfy P = Q = = diag ( 1 ; : : : ; n ). (See <ref> [34, 62, 68] </ref> for a transformation to take a general realisation to a balanced realisation.) We now present some results on balanced realisations. Consider the following conformal partitioning of a balanced realisation.

Reference-contexts: Since such bounds play a central role in determining reduced stability margins and performance degradation when reduced order controllers are substituted for high order controllers <ref> [17, 69, 63, 34] </ref>, Hankel singular values are integral to the techniques of controller approximation. 2.3 Function Spaces In H 1 control the performance of a system is expressed in terms of the H 1 norm of the closed loop transfer function. <p> We will use the notation G s (s) = [G (s)] + and G un (s) = [G (s)] . A bounded H 1 norm has two interpretations of interest in a control framework <ref> [69] </ref> ; firstly in specifying a level of stability robustness to modeling uncertainty; and secondly an input/output interpretation specifying a level of disturbance attenuation. 2.3.1 Stability Robustness G The stability robustness interpretation of kGk 1 &lt; fl relies upon the small gain theorem. <p> Further, given that K is stabilising, it is possible to bound, a priori, the degradation in closed loop performance. This problem has been tackled by, amongst others, McFarlane et al.

However, although this choice minimises the closed loop entropy (for a given fl <ref> [69] </ref>), in certain two block designs the central controller has the undesirable property of attempting to cancel the zeros of the plant [81]. Hence it may be desirable to use the freedom allowed in selecting to choose another (P; fl)-admissible controller from the possible set of all (P; fl)-admissible controllers.

Reference-contexts: Often is chosen to be zero, which is equivalent to selecting the central controller. However, although this choice minimises the closed loop entropy (for a given fl [69]), in certain two block designs the central controller has the undesirable property of attempting to cancel the zeros of the plant <ref> [81] </ref>. Hence it may be desirable to use the freedom allowed in selecting to choose another (P; fl)-admissible controller from the possible set of all (P; fl)-admissible controllers. Here we review two techniques which exploit the freedom in to obtain reduced order (P; fl)-admissible controllers.

Reference-contexts: There are numerous algorithms which may be employed to perform this reduction, including Pade approximation <ref> [83, 74] </ref>, balanced truncation [68, 75], and optimal Hankel norm approximation [34, 36]. <p> The assumption being that by neglecting parameters which contribute little to the fundamental behaviour of the system a suitable reduced order model may be obtained. Such essential parameters may include time moments, Markov parameters and eigenvalues. The methods of Pade <ref> [83] </ref> and Routh [44] fall into this category. Although these techniques tend to be computationally very simple, approximation by such methods tends to be somewhat ad hoc. <p> The main criticisms being that there is no clear choice of which parameters are the best to retain, nor is there an a priori guarantee of how good the approximation will be. Given a stable model, classical Pade approximation doesn't even guarantee to calculate a stable approximant <ref> [83] </ref>.

This class of systems has been studied by Becker [7] for the purpose of controller synthesis. We adopt a similar notation to Becker, and begin by stipulating conditions which guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the class of LPV models to be considered.

Reference-contexts: Such reduced order models possess a good match of the impulse response, however, the step response tends to give steady state errors close to the above upper bound <ref> [88] </ref>. (For k = n 1 the upper bound is achieved at DC [17].) The technique is therefore better for approximation at high frequency than at low frequency, which is not necessarily desirable as most control systems operate at low or middle frequencies. <p> Consequently a number of alternative reduction techniques, all employing balanced re-alisations (but aiming for good low frequency approximation) have been researched since Moore's initial work of 1981. Perhaps the best known of these are those employing a reciprocal transformation <ref> [20, 21, 22, 59, 88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: what is meant by the term H 1 and give two interpretations of an H 1 norm bounded transfer function. 2.3 Function Spaces 10 In the context of this dissertation we will use the following definitions. (For a more general discussion of signals, systems, and their norms, see for instance <ref> [23, 89, 101] </ref>). Definition 2.3.1 The Hilbert space L 2 is the space of signals, u (t), with bounded energy, i.e. <p> If the input to an inner function has bounded energy then the output will be bounded by the same energy level. The properties of inner functions are discussed further in Section 2.7.1. 2.5 Coprime Factorisations As with inner functions, coprime factorisations are used extensively in both H 1 synthesis <ref> [63, 89] </ref> and model approximation [3, 32, 58, 60, 64, 65, 67, 72]. A particular advantage of such multiplicative decompositions for model approximation is the stability of the two coprime factors. <p> In this section we define what is meant by a left coprime factorisation of a transfer function and present some properties of such a fractional representation. Although not stated here, dual results hold for right coprime factorisations. (A detailed discussion of coprime factorisations may be found in <ref> [89] </ref>.)

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, they may equally be interpreted in a controller reduction framework. We concentrate on this interpretation. First we define what is meant by the graph of a transfer matrix and the gap between two transfer matrices. (For a more detailed discussion see <ref> [31, 77, 90] </ref>.) Definition 3.4.1 The graph of a transfer matrix K is the set of all possible bounded input/output pairs, G (K) = u # " U v : v 2 H 2 where K = U V 1 is a right coprime factorisation of K and y = Ku. <p> To calculate this degradation a priori, we must be able to bound ffi (K 0 ; K). Appropriate bounds were originally derived by Georgiou and Smith [32]. However, the following bounds, derived by Vinnicombe in his work on the --gap <ref> [90] </ref> are tighter.

Reference-contexts: This form of realisation greatly reduces both computational and memory requirements. The problem of reducing complexity via reducing the state-dimension has received much attention over the last 30 years. See <ref> [3, 29, 94] </ref> for a comprehensive list of references. However, until recently, few of these approaches considered the fundamental relationship between the model reduction problem and the controller synthesis problem. <p> Since any parameter optimisation tends to be non-convex there is no guarantee that a global optimal solution will be attained. There is a fundamental relationship between the model reduction problem and the controller design problem <ref> [3, 17, 94, 96] </ref>. Since model reduction followed by the design of a low order controller using the reduced order model neglects to take this relationship into account it is generally considered an unsatisfactory approach. <p> Iterative schemes, which alternate between model and controller reduction, such as that proposed by Wortelboer et al. <ref> [94, 96] </ref>, may help overcome such drawbacks. The approach to be taken in this dissertation is that of designing a high order controller from a high order plant, followed by reduction of the high order controller. <p> These techniques are the basis of modern model approximation. In Section 3.2 we present results on open loop model approximation. These generally fall into three categories <ref> [94] </ref>: parameter matching, projection of dynamics and minimum distance approximation. Those open loop techniques which are readily extended to include frequency weights are discussed in Section 3.3. Included is a new derivation of a sufficient condition for reduced order controllers to maintain stability. <p> This successive application of a transformation followed by a truncation is referred to as projection of dynamics <ref> [94] </ref>. Although these methods do not attempt to optimise with respect to any criterion they are computationally simple and generally work well. In addition, balanced truncation has been shown [17, 34] to satisfy an upper bound on the H 1 norm of the error (see Section 3.2.2). <p> This elimination may be undertaken by a number of techniques [8, 12, 29]. Modal reduction is closely related to truncation of a partial fraction expansion of a given transfer function. This may be represented in state space form as a truncation of a Jordan form realisation <ref> [94] </ref>. <p> For a more general discussion of modal reduction see <ref> [94] </ref>. 3.2.2 Balanced Truncation The basis of balanced truncation is the elimination of those states which are least controllable and least observable. The contribution of such states to the overall system input-output response is considered to be negligible and hence they may be ignored without undue loss of accuracy. <p> In Section 7.3 we examine robust performance for the pitch loop of a highly manoeuverable experimental aircraft model. In Section 7.4 we examine tracking control in a Compact Disk mechanism. This has recently been studied by Wortelboer <ref> [94] </ref>, and we compare his results to those obtained from our design techniques. Except when specifically stated otherwise, the results shown come from employing the one block frequency weighted optimal Hankel norm reduction procedure of Section 3.3.2. <p> This problem has been studied extensively by Wortelboer and his co-workers at Philips Research in Eindhoven (see <ref> [94, 87] </ref> and the references therein.) Here we compare controllers derived using the A () approach with one derived by Wortelboer [94]. The principle control problems of a compact disk mechanism are those of tracking and focusing. <p> This problem has been studied extensively by Wortelboer and his co-workers at Philips Research in Eindhoven (see [94, 87] and the references therein.) Here we compare controllers derived using the A () approach with one derived by Wortelboer <ref> [94] </ref>. The principle control problems of a compact disk mechanism are those of tracking and focusing. The tracking function is performed by swinging a radial arm in a horizontal plane below the disk to keep the laser spot pointing at the track as the CD is rotating. <p> For mass production, it is particularly important for a controller to be robust to component tolerances. Here we concentrate on the tracking problem and assume that focusing is guaranteed. This enables us to compare the controllers derived from the approaches proposed in this dissertation with controllers derived by Wortelboer <ref> [94] </ref> using his so called frequency interval balanced reduction. The underlying time domain specifications for the problem to be studied may be found in [87]. <p> We thank Pepijn Wortelboer [95] for supplying the data (and many of his MATLAB 4 scriptfiles), which may also be found in <ref> [94] </ref>. Initially a 120 state model G 120 , which captures the vibration modes with natural frequencies less than 10kHz is available. Before the controller synthesis step, this is reduced to a 32 state model G 32 . The weighting functions have a combined state-order of 5. <p> The weighting functions have a combined state-order of 5. Hence the generalised plant, P , required for H 1 synthesis has 37 states. We choose K 0 to be a 37 state near optimal controller giving kF l (P; K 0 )k 1 5 = fl. In <ref> [94] </ref>, Wortelboer uses frequency interval balanced reduction to perform a closed loop approximation of K 0 . This involves an iteration phase to obtain model reduction weights which emphasise the frequency regions of greatest interest, followed by a closed loop balanced truncation scheme.

Reference-contexts: For two sided weighted optimal Hankel norm approximation both the input and output weights must be invertible. In <ref> [100] </ref>, Zhou presents a procedure to solve the one sided approximation problem with noninvertible weights. Since the design techniques to be presented in Chapter 4 lead to a two sided frequency weighted approximation problem with invertible weights, it is this framework which is now discussed. <p> Although the lower bound is not necessarily attainable, this combined approach leads to approximants with smaller errors than using frequency weighted approximation alone. This will be borne out in Chapter 7 where we use the following combined Hankel norm/convex optimisation approach <ref> [100] </ref> to calculate reduced order controllers. <p> Unfortunately the zeroth order controllers obtained by frequency weighted model reduction without optimisation don't even stabilise the closed loop.

Definition 2.3.1 The Hilbert space L 2 is the space of signals, u (t), with bounded energy, i.e. <p> 11 (I M 22 N 11 ) 1 M 21 M 12 (I N 11 M 22 ) 1 N 12 # F l (M ; F l (N ; *)) = F l (T ; *) For more extensive results on the properties of LFTs and their manipulation see <ref> [15, 101] </ref>. 2.7.1 Inner Functions and LFTs The following theorem on inner matrices and LFTs is central to our development. <p> A derivation for this case may be found in [14]. Relaxing the rank assumptions on D 12 and D 21 in (A3) leads to singular control problems. The LMI based solution reviewed in Section 3.4.2 may be employed to solve such singular problems. In <ref> [101] </ref> a procedure is given which transforms any plant with D 12 full column rank and D 21 full row rank into one which satisfies (A2). Assumptions (A4) and (A5) are required for the corresponding LQG problem to be closed loop asymptotically stable. They are made here for technical reasons. <p> The following definitions are used throughout: W 2 4 o and W 1 = W 1 To calculate a solution via the Nehari Extension Theorem <ref> [1, 23, 101] </ref> we follow the procedure of [54, 39] and solve the equivalent problem inf 1;(k) o (K Q)M ~1 where M o , M 1 o , M i , M 1 i 2 RH 1 such that M ~ o M o = W 2 W ~ i <p> + LC 2 )) &lt; 0, then all controllers which stabilise F l (P; K) are parameterised as K = F l (J ; Q) where J = 6 A + B 2 F + LC 2 L B 2 C 2 I 0 7 and Q 2 RH 1 <ref> [101] </ref>. <p> Note that coprime factorisations exist if G is Q-stabilisable and Q-detectable and may be constructed analogously to their LTI formulations (see for instance <ref> [62, 101] </ref>). Lemma 6.4.2 Assume K is an LPV controller which Q-stabilises the LPV plant G such that kH (G ; K )k i;2 &lt; fl.
