Abstract: c flNEC Research Institute, Technical Report 95 07 Abstract Recently, it has become clear that determining a ranked set of assignments allows computation of very good approximations to the data association problem. Several algorithms have been proposed but only two return the k-best assignments in reasonable time. One is Danchick and Newnams' [DN93] algorithm, which is based on the recognition that determining the best assignment is a classical assignment problem, and that determining a ranked set of assignments may be accomplished by solving a series of modified copies of the initial assignment problem. The other algorithm is originally due to Murty [Mur68] and was most recently described by [CM95] within the context of multi-target tracking. In this paper, we evaluate the two algorithms on simulated and random data and show that Murty's algorithm performs significantly better in all scenarios. We show the relationship between the two algorithms and how Danchick and Newnams' algorithm can be very easily modified to Murty's algorithm. Experimental results using Murty's algorithm suggest that a solution to the real-time data association problem is now feasible.

Reference-contexts: They then proposed to find the second best etc, by modifying the cost matrix and solving the resulting assignment problems. Independent of Danchick and Newnam, Cox and Miller <ref> [CM95] </ref> also recognized that a legal hypothesis was a bipartite graph match, and could therefore be determined by classical assignment algorithms. To find the k-best hypotheses, they suggested using an algorithm first due to Murty [Mur68]. <p> Murty only finds any given solution once, eliminating all these redundant assignment calls. Finally, the third advantage of Murty is that, in the average case, the size of the problem partitioned 5 diminishes rapidly with every sweep <ref> [CM95] </ref>. In DN, the size hardly diminishes at all. <p> The next milestone was Nagarajan et al's [NCS87] insight of collapsing real and clutter targets into one category. Danchick and Newnam [DN93] recognized that the Nagarajan et al formulation was in essence a classical linear assignment problem.

Reference-contexts: Many different methods exist for finding the single best solution to an assignment problem <ref> [GK93] </ref>, and the performance of DN or Murty is highly dependent on which method is selected. However, for a problem of a given size, execution time is approximately proportional to the number of calls made to the assignment routine, since each such call takes roughly the same time.

Reference-contexts: To examine the relative effect of diminishing problem sizes on execution time, we conducted timing trials on two different implementations of each algorithm. DN (JV) is a Fortran implementation of DN, written by Danchick and Newnam and employing Jonker and Volgenant's optimal assignment algorithm <ref> [JV87] </ref>. This assignment algorithm has worst-case performance of O (N 3 ), and average-case performance which we observe to be a little worse than O (N 2 ) on random problems.

For better direct comparison, we implemented the two algorithms in C++, using the original Hungarian method of Kuhn <ref> [Kuh55] </ref>, as M (H) and DN (H). The code for these two implementations is almost identical; in fact, the code for M (H) is exactly the same as that for DN (H), except that a few lines have been added to implement Murty's partitioning.

Reference-contexts: M (JV) is a C implementation of Murty's algorithm, written by Miller, which also employs Jonker and Volgenant's assignment algorithm. M (JV) includes a number of optimizations that dramatically improve performance, and are reported in a companion correspondence <ref> [MSC95] </ref>. However, because of differences in languages, data structures, and heuristics, the execution-times of DN (JV) and M (JV) are not directly 6 weighted 20 fi 20 matrix. comparable. <p> By replacing the original Hungarian method with the faster Jonker Volgenant algorithm, and performing several other optimization discussed in a companion paper <ref> [MSC95] </ref>, we demonstrated that Murthy's algorithm, M (JV), has the potential to produce hundreds of ranked hypotheses in a fraction of a second for measurement-to-target assignment matrices with row and column dimensions also in the hundreds. <p> Danchick and Newnam [DN93] recognized that the Nagarajan et al formulation was in essence a classical linear assignment problem.

To find the k-best hypotheses, they suggested using an algorithm first due to Murty <ref> [Mur68] </ref>. This algorithm determines the k-best hypotheses in low order, O (N 4 ), time and is linear in k. By contrast, the worst-case execution time of Danchick and Newnams' algorithm is exponential in k. Nevertheless, the two algorithms are surprisingly similar.

Reference-contexts: A legal assignment of measurements to targets must satisfy the constraints that (1) a measurement can originate from only a single source target (often called the uniqueness constraints <ref> [Ull79] </ref>) and that (2) a target can give rise to no more than one measurement per cycle.
