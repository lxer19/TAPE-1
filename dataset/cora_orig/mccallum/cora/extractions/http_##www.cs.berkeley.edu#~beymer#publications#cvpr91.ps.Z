Title: Finding Junctions Using the Image Gradient

Abstract: Junctions, the intersection points of three or more intensity surfaces in an image, are useful low-level features in machine vision, with applications in recognition, motion, grouping, and 3D line interpretation. However, the popular edge detectors in use today, which use differential edge operators, fragment edges at junctions, leaving these important features undetected. We propose a junction detector that works by filling in gaps at junctions in edge maps. It uses the image gradient to guide extensions of disconnected edges at junctions. A new representation for the gradient, the bow tie map, is used to implement the endpoint growing rules, which include following gradient ridges and using saddle points in the gradient magnitude. We demonstrate the junction detector on real imagery.

Reference-contexts: This effect becomes worse as the amount of smoothing is increased. Further analysis of the properties of zero crossings at junctions may be found in Beymer <ref> [1] </ref>. We have explored the local properties of the image gradient near a junction to discover useful information to help fill in the gaps. We chose to use gradient information rather than, say, geometrically extending broken edges.

Reference-contexts: Poggio and Torre [5] have shown that the zero crossings of the Laplacian of the Gaussian operator intrinsically form closed contours. This implies that edges will break off into pairs at junctions. Edge detectors that look for maxima in the first directional derivative (Canny <ref> [2] </ref>, Haralick [4]), will often break entire edges off from the junction, creating endpoints. These disconnected edges, however, are actually paired with phantom edges (see Clark [3]), which are basically local minima in the first derivative.

Reference-contexts: This gradient interaction is an unavoidable consequence of smoothing the image, which is introduced by camera optics and purposefully used to filter out noise. The gaps at junctions mistakenly created by gradient-based edge operators have been theoretically analyzed in terms of zero crossings. Poggio and Torre <ref> [5] </ref> have shown that the zero crossings of the Laplacian of the Gaussian operator intrinsically form closed contours. This implies that edges will break off into pairs at junctions.
