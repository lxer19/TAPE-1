Abstract: We discuss a robotic module called a Molecule. Molecules can be the basis for building self-reconfiguring robots. They support multiple modalities of locomotion and manipulation. We describe the design, functionality, and control of the Molecule. We show how a set of Molecules can aggregate as active three-dimensional structures that can move and change shape. Finally, we discuss global motion algorithms for Molecular structures.

Reference-contexts: One degree of freedom allows rotation about one connector. The second degree-of-freedom allows rotation of the atom about the bond. Detailed descriptions of the design and control of the Molecule can be found in <ref> [ Kotay et al, 1998b ] </ref> . A set of such Molecules can self-aggregate as arbitrary three-dimensional structures. We show this result by demonstrating several different tilings of the plane with the Molecule. The tilings can be stacked so that the resulting structures are three-dimensional.
