Abstract: As software control of time-critical functions in embedded systems becomes more common, a means for the precise specification of their behavior becomes increasingly important. Modechart is a graphical specification language introduced to meet this need. This paper presents a method for verifying properties of systems specified in Modechart. The proposed approach makes use of a computation graph which takes advantage of the structuring inherent in a Modechart specification. Three classes of properties are presented for which decision procedures are developed.
