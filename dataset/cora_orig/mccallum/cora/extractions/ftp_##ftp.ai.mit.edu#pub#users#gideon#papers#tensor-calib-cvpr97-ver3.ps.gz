Title: Lens Distortion Calibration Using Point Correspondences

Abstract: This paper describes a new method for lens distortion calibration using only point correspondences in multiple views, without the need to know either the 3D location of the points or the camera locations. The standard lens distortion model is a model of the deviations of a real camera from the ideal pinhole or projective camera model. Given multiple views of a set of corresponding points taken by ideal pinhole cameras there exist epipolar and trilinear constraints among pairs and triplets of these views. In practice, due to noise in the feature detection and due to lens distortion these constraints do not hold exactly and we get some error. The calibration is a search for the lens distortion parameters that minimize this error. Using simulation and experimental results with real images we explore the properties of this method. We describe the use of this method with the standard lens distortion model, radial and decentering, but it could also be used with any other parametric distortion models. Finally we demonstrate that lens distortion calibration improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: The two image method Given a point in one view we know that the corresponding point in the other view must line along an epipolar line. Given at least 8 point correspondences we can find the epipoles and epipolar lines in a linear manner <ref> [6] </ref> (5 using non-linear methods). With more than 8 points we can find the least squares solution. The epipolar constraint holds for ideal pinhole cameras. Due to noise in the feature detection and due to lens distortion we get some error.

Reference-contexts: Image capture and processing was performed on an SGI Indy workstation. The camera parameters were found using a nonlinear optimization program based on the subroutine LMDIF from the software package MINPACK-1 <ref> [7] </ref>. This subroutine uses a modified Levenberg-Marquart algorithm. 6.2. Experiment 1: finding the lens distortion pa rameters Using all 75 points in the 3 images (figures 2a,2b,2c) I computed the trilinear tensor (see section 3) and then the reprojection error from images 2b and 2c to image 2a.

Reference-contexts: Due to noise and lens distortion, the reprojection is not perfect. We define our cost function as the RMS reprojection error and find lens distortion parameters that minimize it. 2. Related work Known world coordinates: The classic method for lens distortion calibration is the bundle adjustment method <ref> [8] </ref>. It uses one or more views of a calibration object with known 3D coordinates (control points). Using iterative methods it then finds both external parameters (position and orienta-tion) and internal camera parameters. <p> The perspective projection model with lens dis tortion These projective constraints assume a perfect pinhole model. This is a good model for long focal lengths but medium to wide angle lenses have noticeable lens distortion. The standard model for lens distortion <ref> [8] </ref> is a mapping from the distorted image coordinates, (x d ; y d ), that are observable, to the undistorted image plane coordinates, (x u ; y u ), which are not physically measurable using the equation: x u = x d + x 0 0 2 0 4 y <p> d = (x 2 d c yr ) 2 (4) It has been shown in [12] that allowing the center of radial distortion, (c xr ; c yr ) to be different from the principal point is a good approximation to adding the terms for decentering distortion as given in <ref> [8] </ref>. 4. The algorithm The step by step algorithm is as follows: 1. Find point correspondences between 3 views. 2. Make an initial guess of the distortion parameters: an appropriate guess for (Cx,Cy) is the center of the image. <p> Especially, since most of the computational machinery required for tasks such as finding the trilinear tensor or fundamental matrix probably already exists in the overall system. The Manual of Photogrammetry <ref> [8] </ref> warns us that the strong coupling that exists between interior elements of orientation [principal point, focal length] and exterior elements can be expected to result in unacceptably large variances for these particular projective parameters when recovered on a frame-by-frame basis.

Reference-contexts: The error function is in general well behaved and the distortion parameters can easily be found by nonlinear search techniques. 1.2. The three image method Corresponding points in three images are related by 4 independent trilinear equations. <ref> [9] </ref>. These equations have 27 parameters which can be found in a linear manner given at least 7 point correspondences. These parameters allow us to reproject corresponding points given in two of the images into the third image. Due to noise and lens distortion, the reprojection is not perfect. <p> The trilinear tensor tonstraint Shashua <ref> [9] </ref> shows that given a set of 3D points there exists a set of trilinear equations between the projections of those points into any three perspective views. In total there exist 9 such equations for each point with at most 4 being independent.

Reference-contexts: There are a total of nine column vectors ff ij for a total of 27 coefficients. Seven point correspondences give 28 equations which are enough to recover the coefficients up to a scale factor. The 27 coefficients can be arranged into a 3 fi 3 fi 3 tensor <ref> [10] </ref>. Given 7 points in 3 images one can recover the tensor. Given the tensor and the location of a further corresponding point in two of the images one can calculate the location of that point in the third image. 3.2.

Reference-contexts: Figure (3d) shows the RMS reprojection error using the images Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b. The minimum error is obtained near the value of K1 found using the distortion calibration. 6.4. Experiment 3: euclidean reconstruction Projective reconstruction from the three images was performed according to <ref> [11] </ref>. Transformation to Euclidean 3D coordinates then required 5 control points. Three points were chosen from the planar surface and two other points were chosen such that the five were in general position, no 4 points coplanar.
