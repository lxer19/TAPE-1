Abstract: We investigate the performance of wormhole-routed networks under hybrid traffic loads to examine the impact of long and short messages on each other. The short messages not only experience increased average latency but also experience a large increase in the variance of that latency. The negative performance impact of long messages increases proportionally with both the fraction and size of the long messages. We also explore two techniques: virtual lanes and adaptive routing to improve network performance under the hybrid traffic loads. Performance losses due to long messages can be dramatically reduced with either technique. The two techniques are complementary, so employing them simultaneously yields the best performance of all, virtually eliminating performance losses experienced by short messages. This means that pack-etization may not be necessary in such networks.

Reference-contexts: All of these multicom-puter systems use direct networks, meaning that the computing nodes are embedded in the network topology, and as a result, some nodes are closer than others. In addition to use in multicomputers, direct networks are gaining acceptance in shared memory machines such as the MIT Alewife <ref> [2, 1] </ref>, Stanford DASH [21], and Tera Computer's TERA machine [4]. The performance of these highly parallel systems is closely tied to the throughput and latency provided by their routing networks.
