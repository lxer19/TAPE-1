Abstract: The NASA Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) project is exploring the use of computer simulation to facilitate the design of new jet engines. Several key issues raised in this research are being examined in an NPSS-related research project: zooming, monitoring and control, and support for heterogeneity. The design of a simulation executive that addresses each of these issues is described. In this work, the strategy of zooming, which allows codes that model at different levels of fidelity to be integrated within a single simulation, is applied to the fan component of a turbofan propulsion system. A prototype monitoring and control system has been designed for this simulation to support experimentation with expert system techniques for active control of the simulation. An interconnection system provides a transparent means of connecting the heterogeneous systems that comprise the prototype.

Reference-contexts: There are four, mostly orthogonal, parts to Schooner: a specification language, an intermediate data representation and accompanying data exchange library, a set of stub compilers, and a runtime support system. The Universal Type System (UTS) provides both the specification language and the intermediate data representation <ref> [7] </ref>. The specification language is machine and language-independent and is used to describe the inter-face for each component application. The UTS intermediate data representation provides a medium for exchanging data across machine architectures and handling data structure differences among languages.
