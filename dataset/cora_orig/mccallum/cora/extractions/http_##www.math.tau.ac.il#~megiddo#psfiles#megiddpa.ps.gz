Title: Essay 9 On Probabilistic Machines, Bounded Rationality and Average-Case Complexity  
Author: Nimrod Megiddo 
Abstract: The analogs of pure, mixed and behavior strategies in the context of algorithms are studied. It is shown that probabilistic machines are more powerful than probability distributions over deterministic ones, that best response may sometimes requires randomization, and that if na-ture's choices are computable then there exists a deterministic best response.

Reference-contexts: A strategy which makes probabilistic choices at every decision point is called a behavior strategy. It is well known that a mixed strategy is at least as powerful as a behavior strategy and the two are of equivalent power if the game has perfect recall <ref> [1] </ref>. Also, a best response to the opponent's mixed strategy can be played without randomization. In recent years, there has been a growing literature on playing games through computing machines (see, for example, [2]), attempting to understand bounded rationality.

On the other hand, complexity theory sometimes uses ideas from game theory (see, for example, [3]). With some reservations, algorithms can be viewed as strategies, so concepts similar to mixed and behavior strategies can be defined with respect to algorithms.

We show here that algorithms exhibit phenomena which are quite different from the ones we know from game theory.
