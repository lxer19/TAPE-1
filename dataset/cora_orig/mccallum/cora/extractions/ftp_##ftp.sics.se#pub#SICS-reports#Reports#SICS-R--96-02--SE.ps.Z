Abstract: Report R96:02 ISRN : SICS-R-96/02-SE ISSN : 0283-3638 Abstract This survey is meant to serve computer scientists, mathematicians and others who need to get quickly acquainted with the most relevant results in the biology and psychology of the tactile senses but have little or no prior exposure to the field. The survey is written from the point of view of a computer scientists studying artificial neural networks (ANNs). Questions of relevancy what to include and what to exclude in the survey are always very subjective. This survey tries to include biological and psychological knowledge and results that could provide ANN research with new ideas and insights. Also, the survey includes matters that could make the opposite to take place: ANN research providing biology and psychology with new ideas or insights.

Reference-contexts: Thie threshold varies depending to (at least): 1. The location of the stimulus on the surface of the body [27] 2. The sex of the subject [31]. 3. The frequency and temperature and the waveform of the stimulus <ref> [1] </ref>, if vibratory. 4. The area of the contactor 6 , the duration of the stimulus and the presence of surround [8] 5.

Reference-contexts: In some receptors the membrane potential and the impulse discharge occur in two different cells while in other receptors they occur in the one and same cell. Examples of both can be found, for instance, in <ref> [2] </ref> and [25]. Taking an engineering point of view, we can find at least three, mutually exclusive points which could be said to form the interface between the sensory receptor and the nervous system proper: 1. The point of impulse discharge.

Reference-contexts: If the distance between the points of stimuli is less than the two-point limen, the subject perceives the two points as one. However, it has been shown , that practice can reduce the limen considerably <ref> [3] </ref>. Another widely used measure is the error of localization. In this measurement, there are always two stimuli that are separated by a small time interval. The subject is then asked to indicate whether the same point was touch at both times or not.

Reference-contexts: Double-filter model Double-filter model <ref> [4] </ref> is a theory attempting to explain and to set bounds for the order in which tactile skills develop during infancy. The starting point of the model is the realization that in order to get information about a particular tactile attribute may require certain motor skills. <p> This explains why the perception of texture and compressibility is developed at an earlier age than the perception of weight even though the necessary motor skills for the both develop at the same time. Bushnell and Boudreau <ref> [4] </ref> suggest that the double-filter model is suitable for making predictions on the development of perception of tactile attributes.

Reference-contexts: Here are some of the results. If two tactile stimuli are separated by about 5 ms or more, they are perceived as separate events. If the separation is less, they are perceived as one <ref> [7] </ref>. For hearing the threshold is about 0.01 ms and for vision it is about 25 ms [26]. The ability two perceive that two stimuli are sequential as opposed to simultaneous does not necessarily give the ability to determine what the sequence, or order of the stimuli, is.

Reference-contexts: For hearing the threshold is about 0.01 ms and for vision it is about 25 ms [26]. The ability two perceive that two stimuli are sequential as opposed to simultaneous does not necessarily give the ability to determine what the sequence, or order of the stimuli, is. Some experiments <ref> [11] </ref>, suggest that the threshold for determining the order of two successive stimuli is about 20 ms for all the three senses: vision, hearing and touch.

Reference-contexts: The homunculus is located in the primary somatosensory cortes or S I.

The understanding of how these two areas are interconnected and how they interact has changed over the years. A quite complex picture has emerged. For instance, it was assumed that serial processing took place in the association cortex, while information was transferred from S I to S II.

Reference-contexts: Some experiments [11], suggest that the threshold for determining the order of two successive stimuli is about 20 ms for all the three senses: vision, hearing and touch. Also, the ability to count the number of stimuli has been studied <ref> [16] </ref>, and it seems that tactile sense is better for counting than vision but not as good as hearing. 2.2. Spatial differences Similarly to what has been done with the temporal aspects of tactile stimuli, there has been many studies on the spatial aspects.

Reference-contexts: Intermodality Most studies done on intermodality focus on touch and vision. In general, vision dominates over touch [10],[32], but not always. For instance, if the subject is given texture recognition tasks such dominance is not always observed <ref> [17] </ref> Also, if the subject is asked to estimate temporal rates, audition tends to dominate over vision [21].

Later it was shown that this is not the case, see <ref> [20] </ref>. Instead, it turned out that several subparts of the thalamus pass somatosensory information on to one or more somatosensory areas.

Another related geometrical concept is a cortical column. It was found that cortical units that fall on the same line tend to process information about the same submodality if the line is perpendicular to the surface of the cortex and different submodalities if the line is not perpendicular.

Reference-contexts: The connection relay cells preserve geometrical representation of the body found in the ventral posterior nucleus and project it onto the somatosensory cortex. The geometrical representation at the cortex is know as the homunculus and Homunculus was first studied by Penfield et al <ref> [22] </ref>. The body parts which have high acuity of perception, such as lips or fingers, comprise large areas of the homunculus and less acute parts comprise much smaller areas. The homunculus is located in the primary somatosensory cortes or S I.

Touch receptors The main sensory receptors of skin are listed for example in <ref> [ 25 ] </ref> . The receptor types can be grouped in several alternative ways according to their properties. One main property is the type of the neural fiber to which the neuron is connected. Receptors connected to Abeta fibers are: 1. <p> In some receptors the membrane potential and the impulse discharge occur in two different cells while in other receptors they occur in the one and same cell.
