Title: Hierarchical Techniques for Global Illumination Computations Recent Trends and Developments

Abstract: Since the beginning of computer graphics, one of the primary goals has been to create convincingly realistic images of three-dimensional environments that would be impossible to distinguish from photographs of the real scene. The goal to create photo-realistic images has lead to the development of completely new software techniques for dealing with the inherent geometric and optical complexity of real world scenes. This paper gives an overview of advanced algorithms for photo-realistic rendering and in particular discusses hierarchical techniques for global illumination computations.

Reference-contexts: As Fredholm equations of the second kind <ref> [Atk76] </ref>, they cannot be solved analytically, except for trivial cases. Instead, numerical algorithms for computing a solution must be used, all of which are derived from two basic numerical approaches: Finite Element and Monte-Carlo (or point sampling) techniques. In this paper, we focus on the hierarchical Finite Element approach.

Reference-contexts: Wavelets and Higher Order Function Spaces Most of the hierarchical algorithms use simple constant basis functions for representing illumination on a patch, requiring only a single coefficient for this representation. The Galerkin construction of Finite-Element algorithms also works for higher order basis functions <ref> [CW93] </ref>. The formal mathematical basis for a hierarchical construc-tion is the Wavelet theory that describes hierarchical function spaces [Dau92]. Hierarchical wavelet algorithms have been used in various ways in rendering, e.g. for radiosity computations [GSCH93,SGCH93], or for full radiance computations [CSSD94,Sch94,PB94].

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, if the two surfaces are far apart or exchange only very little energy, it might be sufficient to compute the exchange between large patches in upper levels of the quadtrees <ref> [HSA91] </ref> (see Figure 2). During the computation the hierarchical algorithms automatically selects the coarsest level at which the accuracy requirements can be met. The same surface may receive and send illumination at various levels of the discretiza-tion hierarchy. It is therefore necessary to keep the different levels consistent. <p> A refinement procedure selects the coarsest level at which the transport can be computed within a user selected error threshold. can be described as a single push/pull procedure, that keeps the different representations of illumination consistent <ref> [HSA91] </ref>. Representing and Solving the Linear System A matrix is certainly not an appropriate way to represent the exchange coefficients of the linear system. The complex interactions between different levels in the hierarchy can best be represented by storing the exchange coefficients explicitly as links between the two patches. <p> Fig. 3. Links between two patches generated by using Multi-Wavelets of various orders. Constant: 1 coefficient per link (left), Bi-linear: 16 coefficients (center), bi-quadratic: 81 coefficients (right). For hierarchical radiosity computations several different refiners have been proposed. The most important refiners use the exchange coefficient itself (F-refinement) <ref> [HSA91] </ref>, resulting radiance on the receiver (BF-refinement), or reflected flux (BFA-refinement) for estimating the error that is committed by transporting light across a link. The BFA-refiner seems to work best for all kinds of environments and is used in most implementations.

Reference-contexts: The BFA-refiner is well behaved and usually works without a minimum size for patches, which is imperative for the other two refiners. Several modified versions of these refiners have also been proposed (e.g. <ref> [HSD94] </ref>). Wavelets and Higher Order Function Spaces Most of the hierarchical algorithms use simple constant basis functions for representing illumination on a patch, requiring only a single coefficient for this representation. The Galerkin construction of Finite-Element algorithms also works for higher order basis functions [CW93]. <p> The problem is that the benefits of linear complexity of the hierarchical algorithms are only exploited during adaptive refinement. A simple solution would be to avoid initial linking wherever possible <ref> [HSD94] </ref>. Another approach extends the hierarchical algorithm. In order to use the benefits of adaptive computation of hierarchical algorithms, we must extend the hierarchy that exists below the level of a surface to a full hierarchy covering the whole scene. This can be done by grouping related surfaces into clusters.

Reference-contexts: If tight conservative bounds are computed for the input parameters, the resulting exchange coefficients can also be bounded by applying interval or affine arithmetic [Moo66,CS93,Sny92]. The location of points and their normals can efficiently be bound with the cone of normals technique <ref> [SA93] </ref> and bounding boxes. Based on this data, bounds on the set of connecting rays, cosines factors, distances, and solid angles can be computed. Bounds can also be computed for visibility between patches. Finally, these terms are combined for obtaining a conservatively bounded estimate of the exchange coefficient [SSS97b].

Reference-contexts: In order to avoid some of the resulting artifacts, light energy received by a cluster can immediately be propagated to all surfaces in its hierarchy. This allows to use the direction of the incident light while it is still known and computing its contribution to each surface separately <ref> [SAG94] </ref>. Note, that this is different and still much more efficient than computing the form factor to each surface separately. The cluster algorithms can also be extended for using non-isotropic interactions with its environment by storing the directional distribution of emitted energy with each cluster [SDS95]. Fig. 5. <p> The lower bound is always assumed to be zero. This approach ignores much of the information that is available or can easily be computed for a link <ref> [SAG94] </ref>. Such information includes geometric quantities like the extent of sender and receiver, their distance, and the variation of normal vectors across each surface. The variation of normal vectors is of particular importance for the ability to treat curved surfaces efficiently.

Reference-contexts: These values can then be used by the new refinement strategy for deciding where to refine links. Links are refined, when the difference between upper and lower bound becomes too large. The new refiner also has enough information for deciding whether to refine the sender or the receiver <ref> [SSS97a] </ref>. The decision is based on their relative influence on the error. This is an important benefit over previous refiners, where no such information is available. exchange between a planar patch and a cylinder. <p> This allows a wide variety of objects Fig. 6.

As shown in <ref> [SSS97a] </ref> the same strategy can be extended to work equally well for environment with clusters. Although it is more difficult to compute bounds for clusters, the algorithms and refiners still benefit considerably for having accurate bounds available.

Reference-contexts: This can be done by grouping related surfaces into clusters. These clusters can in turn be grouped hierarchically into larger clusters until the whole scene is contained in a single root cluster [Sil95,SAG94,GH96]. Although "hand made" cluster hierarchies often perform slightly better <ref> [SSS97c] </ref>, automatic clustering algorithms are preferred, because they are applicable to general and complex scenes. Here, hierarchical bounding volume algorithms seem to give best results compared to octrees or k-d trees [SD95,SSS97c] .

Reference-contexts: Even the larger approximation power of bi-quadratic or bi-cubic functions cannot adequately represent these features and still requires subdivision resulting in additional links that are much more expensive than in the constant case. In these situations the larger approximation power cannot compensate the increased memory requirements for storing links <ref> [WH97] </ref>. One possibility to avoid subdivision in these situations is by approximately representing visibility separately using a shadow mask [SSSS95,Zat93]. 4 Clustering The main problem with hierarchical algorithms as described in the previous section is that the algorithms still have quadratic complexity in the number of input surfaces.
