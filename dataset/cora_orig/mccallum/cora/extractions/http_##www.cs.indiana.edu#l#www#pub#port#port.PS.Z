Abstract: The phenomenon of incomplete neutralization and the subtlety of this incompleteness reveals vividly that speech sounds do not fall into discretely distinct phonetic types, and also that auditory impressions cannot be relied upon to identify them. AMR appreciates that these failures pose a serious problem for phonology. The reason is that the segmental units of standard phonology inherit the properties of discreteness and auditory identifiability from universal phonetics. So if phonetics is not always discrete, and practical identification is inherently unreliable, then phonology must restructure itself from the ground up. Phonology would then have no way to account for its discrete phonological objects (whether phonemes, rules, syllable trees, metrical grids, rule rankings, allophonic rules, etc). This seems to be the theoretical bad dream that concerns AMR. I will argue that all
