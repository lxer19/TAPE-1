Reference-contexts: The designer's task is to determine the application conditions for each modification that results with high enough frequency in superior designs. Machine learning techniques [56] can be used to automate the construction of evolutionary rules. Furthermore, planning techniques <ref> [2] </ref> can help to organize the application of new sets of initial and evolutionary heuristics in better design strategies. 7.2.3 Use more sophisticated model formulation techniques At its current phase, DIAS supports compositional modeling techniques [15] for formulating physical knowledge models based on the current design description and the current sets

QPT is especially suitable for modeling chemical processes, because its process-centered ontology is able to capture the physical principles on which unit operations in Chemical Engineering are based <ref> [6] </ref>. 59 4.2.1 Qualitative Analysis There are two major styles of qualitative analysis: (i) qualitative simulation and (ii) model construction. Qualitative simulation generates qualitative descriptions for the behavior of a physical system.

Reference-contexts: Figure 4.2 provides the definitions for all the objects in the qualitative model. A physob is the simplest kind of object in the domain theory. In order to describe all the fluid pieces of stuff that are present in a column we use the contained stuff ontology <ref> [11] </ref>. More specifically, a Contained-Binary-Mixture is defined by the substances it is composed of, by the phase it is in and by the container which holds it. This definition is similar to the one used for contained stuffs in [12].

Reference-contexts: The model is used to compute cost estimates for possible flowsheets during the conceptual design of separation systems. At this early stage of design, these cost estimates are rough approximations for pruning the number of design choices <ref> [13] </ref>. The model does not describe the dynamic behavior of columns for multicomponent mixtures. The qualitative domain theory consists of four objects; separation systems (a sequence of separation units (e.g. distillation columns)), columns, mixtures and substances. <p> In the case of binary mixtures, the numerical models consist of a set of equations that describe the dynamic and steady-state behavior of binary columns. In the case of multicomponent mixtures, the numerical models are based on the Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland short-cut method for designing distillation and extractive distillation units <ref> [13] </ref>. equations in the system. Each defEquation form consists of four parts: 1. The Name part provides a name for the equation. This name is stored along with any solutions obtained using this equation in order to support debugging and explanation tasks in the future. 2. <p> Calculate the minimum theoretical stages for the desired separation. This is done using a version of the Gilliland-Fenske equation for multicomponent mixtures <ref> [13] </ref>. 4. Calculate the minimum reflux ratio. The Underwood equation [54] provides a good approximation for this calculation. Most of these calculations require the relative volatilities between the separation keys and the distillate and product flow rates for the separation scheme. <p> It turns out that there is not enough information to compute a numerical value for the number of stages in the column at this point. As a result, the system looks for equations that provide estimates for any of the design parameters. The Gilliland-Fenske equation <ref> [13] </ref> provides an estimate for the number of stages in the column that corresponds to a 13-stage column. The results of the qualitative and numerical analysis analysis along with the contents of the design knowledge component are fed into the heuristic analysis stage of the design algorithm (Figure 5.35). <p> B.5) which is a special-purpose parameter used for computing the reflux ratio for a given separation using the Underwood equation [35]. Note that there is a constant relative volatility value used in this equation for each pair of substances. All of the shortcut design procedures rely on this assumption <ref> [13] </ref>. In addition, the sharp separation assumption in the preconditions of this equation allows us to use the feed flow rate for each substance instead of the distillate flow rate for that substance. Finally, we assume that the feed to the current column is always liquid. <p> The minimum reflux ratio is used in Figure B.7 in the Operating-Reflux-Ratio-1 equation to compute an estimate of the operating reflux ratio (the quantity Reflux-Ratio) for the column. The particular value of the Operating-Reflux-Estimate used is 1.2 as suggested by <ref> [13] </ref>. This value is supplied to the model as one of the design assumptions in the problem specification.

Reference-contexts: Qualitative simulation generates qualitative descriptions for the behavior of a physical system. The Qualitative Process Engine (QPE) <ref> [17] </ref> is an example of a system that is based on QPT and produces qualitative simulations of physical systems. Model construction generates models that are consistent with a domain model and a scenario. The domain model contains qualitative descriptions of the domain's physics. <p> The qualitative and the numerical models in the physical knowledge along with the heuristic rules in the design knowledge are translated into rules that are fed into an assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS) [9]. A rule engine (ATMoSphere) <ref> [17] </ref> provides the interface to the ATMS. The heuristic analysis uses the design knowledge to construct focus environments [19] that determine the set of `promising' separation alternatives at each design step. <p> Heuristic rules along with the rest of the design knowledge are implemented as rules that are fed into an assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS) [9]. A rule engine (ATMoSphere) <ref> [17] </ref> provides the interface to the ATMS. All of the heuristics are translated into ATMoSphere rules. The conventions used in ATMoSphere are explained in [20].

Reference-contexts: Its domain of applicability specifies the constraints and/or the parameter values under which the model is valid. The accuracy of the model indicates how close are the model predictions with the observed behavior. In terms of ontologies, there are two main modeling approaches: process-centered and device-centered ontologies. Process-centered ontologies <ref> [18] </ref> postulate a set of processes as the agents of causation in the world. For example, the boiling process is responsible for the conversion of water into steam in the kettle I forgot on the stove while writing this piece 1 . <p> For example, mapping the values of quantities into their signs is a common technique in this reasoning style. OUZO investigates the use of process-centered qualitative models in capturing the physical knowledge used in the design of separation systems. We use Qualitative Process Theory (QPT) <ref> [18] </ref> as our modeling language. Appendix A provides a brief review of QPT for readers not familiar with it.

Reference-contexts: A rule engine (ATMoSphere) [17] provides the interface to the ATMS. The heuristic analysis uses the design knowledge to construct focus environments <ref> [19] </ref> that determine the set of `promising' separation alternatives at each design step. These environments are combined with the instantiated qualitative model fragments to determine the actual numerical models at each point in the design process. 4.5 Numerical models Representation. <p> This information is stored in the ATMS-Context, Focus-Predicates and Execution-Order slots. The ATMS-Context slot determines the problem-solving context under which the heuristic rules are applied. In the current implementation, the problem-solving context is determined by an ATMS focus environment <ref> [19] </ref>. This consists of a set of assumptions representing the major design decisions considered by the system at the current stage. There are two possible problem-solving contexts. <p> There are two possible problem-solving contexts. Under the :Implied-By context specified in Figure 5.30, all the application conditions for each heuristic rule must be implied by the current focus environment in the ATMS in order for the heuristic rule to trigger <ref> [19] </ref>. In the :In context all the applications conditions for each heuristic rule must hold for the rule to fire. A generic focus environment is used in this case.

Reference-contexts: A rule engine (ATMoSphere) [17] provides the interface to the ATMS. All of the heuristics are translated into ATMoSphere rules. The conventions used in ATMoSphere are explained in <ref> [20] </ref>. When necessary we use LISP to create new assertions. 5.1.2 The Interpreter Primitives The design interpreter in OUZO contains thirteen primitives for implementing the actions suggested by the heuristic rules. These primitives are commands to the interpreter describing how to update the set of design choices.

Reference-contexts: The scenario contains a structural description of the system that is analyzed (i.e. what objects exist and how they are related) along with the modeling assumptions underlying the analysis. Model construction is usually a subset of what a qualitative simulator does. SIMGEN <ref> [21] </ref> is an example of a system that uses this kind of analysis. OUZO uses a subset of the qualitative analysis in SIMGEN. 4.3 Binary Distillation Columns 4.3.1 Overview The following sections provide a detailed description of the qualitative model for a binary distillation column. <p> Appendix C describes these rules in detail. 5.2 Controlling OUZO The controller algorithm in OUZO is a design cycle consisting of the following phases (Fig. 5.35): (1) Qualitatively analyze the current design description. The qualitative analysis performed by the system is the same as the one used in SIMGEN <ref> [21] </ref>. It is used to determine the operating conditions under which each model fragment in the domain theory is active. (2) Construct and solve the numerical model. The activation of the model fragments in the numerical model depends on the results of the qualitative analysis and the current focus environment. <p> As a result, qualitative models have to support what seems to be the computation-ally most expensive stage of the design process. However, we believe that adapting the current analysis routines (which were taken from SIMGEN <ref> [21] </ref>) to fit more closely the needs of design, will have a positive effect on the run-time behavior of OUZO. For example, we believe that using a justification-based truth maintenance system (JTMS) in the examples we described above will improve significantly the performance.

Reference-contexts: Section 4.3.2 describes the model components that support this task. The second one is to provide the physical knowledge that is necessary to solve the design problem for binary distillation columns <ref> [35] </ref>. The part of the model used in OUZO consists of the dynamic behavior component (Section 4.3.2) overlayed by the model fragments implementing the steady-state analysis (Section 4.3.3). The qualitative domain theory consists of three main objects; mixtures, stages and column. <p> The equilibrium stages assumption is introduced when the predicate (Consider (Equilibrium-Stages-in ?column)) is asserted in the scenario. The conditions under which these assumptions are valid are described in more detail in <ref> [35] </ref>, [22], [36], [24]. This set of idealizations is commonly used in describing the dynamic behavior of staged binary distillation columns for nearly ideal systems operating at `medium' pressures. <p> This model is not able to capture the effects of changes in the temperature or the pressure under which the column operates. Constant molal overflow, constant relative volatility, equilibrium stages and steady-state assumptions are standard simplifications used in solving the design problem for binary columns <ref> [35] </ref>. These assumptions along with the negligible vapor holdup are also typical assumptions made in simple models for the dynamic behavior of binary columns [36]. All these assumptions are always in force for all the tasks the model is used in (design & simulation). Fluid mass flows. <p> Stedy-State Behavior of Binary Columns. An analytical version of the McCabe-Thiele method <ref> [35] </ref> is used to capture the steady-state behavior of a binary column. This model is based on the one described above for the dynamic behavior of a column. <p> Both simulators produced the same results. All the models for the binary columns were used in a system for solving the design problem for binary distillation <ref> [35] </ref>. The multicomponent model was used in a program for the evolutionary design of multicomponent separation systems. <p> Figure 5.33 contains the evolutionary part of the strategy. Finally, OUZO supports a pure heuristic strategy for the binary distillation design problem that is based on the McGabe-Thiele method <ref> [35] </ref>. Figure 5.34 describes the implementation for this strategy. 5.1.5 Configuration Synthesis Rules This is a set of rules that provide a set of procedures for changing the current design description and monitoring the state of design. <p> In addition, four well-known separation cases from the chemical engineering literature were used to test the physical and design knowledge components for the multicomponent mixtures. 6.2 The Binary Distillation Design Problem 6.2.1 The Design Specifications In the binary distillation design problem <ref> [35] </ref> the desired separation is specified along with the flow at some point (usually the reflux). What has to be determined is the number of stages that are necessary to achieve the given separation. In the particular instance of the problem we describe below (taken from [35]), we considered a benzene <p> binary distillation design problem <ref> [35] </ref> the desired separation is specified along with the flow at some point (usually the reflux). What has to be determined is the number of stages that are necessary to achieve the given separation. In the particular instance of the problem we describe below (taken from [35]), we considered a benzene toluene distillation process with the pressure set at 1 atm and with a constant relative volatility between the two substances set at 2.25 throughout the column. The rest of the variables were set as follows: 1. <p> Figure 6.3 contains the proposed design. 6.2.3 Statistics This example ran on an IBM RS/6000, Model 320, with 64MB of RAM running Lucid Common Lisp. The results from OUZO (a column with 12 equilibrium stages) were consistent with the ones found in <ref> [35] </ref>. These results correspond to the program trace we described above. <p> The method starts by calculating the parameter Phi (in equation Ternary-Mixture-Underwood-Phi-Calculation, Fig. B.5) which is a special-purpose parameter used for computing the reflux ratio for a given separation using the Underwood equation <ref> [35] </ref>. Note that there is a constant relative volatility value used in this equation for each pair of substances. All of the shortcut design procedures rely on this assumption [13].

Reference-contexts: The design process ends when the design description remains unchanged during a design cycle. In this case, if the design specifications are satisfied OUZO terminates with success, otherwise it exits with failure. 5.3 Discussion As we mentioned in chapter 3 there are three important problems in process synthesis <ref> [42] </ref>: 1. The Representation Problem consists of developing a representation of the problem that is both expressive and effective. 2. The Evaluation Problem consists of finding ways of efficiently evaluating the design alternatives. 3. The Strategy Problem is the development of strategies that optimize the screening of alternatives.

Reference-contexts: The particular numerical value for the estimate (1.3) is part of the Nath & Motard method <ref> [43] </ref>. Disregard separations with very small relative volatilities between the keys (9).

The formula calculates what is called the coefficient of the difficulty of a separation (CDS) for a separation scheme. The lower the CDS value for an alternative the more promising this appears to be. <p> Figure 5.10 contains the representation for this heuristic rule. The form (No-Good (Possible (Separation ....))) in the figure represents possible separation alternatives that were already examined in some previous design cycle. 1 The set of criteria include <ref> [43] </ref>: (i) Favor separations with large relative volatilities between the keys (ii) Favor balanced columns (i.e. columns in which the flow rates for the distillate and the bottoms products are approximately the same) (iii) Favor sloppy splits for the keys (i.e. separations that do not require high recoveries for the keys) <p> Figure 5.15 contains the description for this rule. Evolutionary Heuristics in the Nath & Motard method Table 5.2 taken from <ref> [43] </ref> describes the evolutionary heuristics used in the Nath & Motard design strategy.

Currently, OUZO supports two of the most significant evolutionary strategies for the synthesis of separation sequences <ref> [43] </ref>, [54]. For the Nath & Motard strategy the representation for the method that creates the initial design flowsheet is given in Figure 5.31. Figure 5.30 contains the representation for the evolutionary part of the strategy. <p> The version we are going to describe below is the same as <ref> [43] </ref>. Table 6.2 contains the problem definition that we used. In this case we have a mixture of three components (n-Hexane, Benzene and Cyclohexane) which we want to separate into pure component products. The composition, the flow rate, the temperature and the pressure of the input mixture are given. <p> We implemented two evolutionary design strategies in OUZO for this problem, the Seader & Westerberg [54] and the Nath & Motard <ref> [43] </ref> strategies. The traces for both methods are described below. 6.3.1 The Nath & Motard Strategy Trace The design process begins with a qualitative and numerical analysis of the problem description. <p> The corresponding numerical models for alt-1 are constructed and solved.

Both methods relied on the use of heuristic strategies to prune the number of design alternatives. The designs proposed by the Nath & Motard method were consistent with the ones reported in <ref> [43] </ref>. We know of no published results for the Seader & Westerberg method on the C 6 separation problem. In terms of performance the two methods were not equivalent. <p> The version we are going to describe below is the same as the one presented in <ref> [43] </ref>. Table 6.5 contains the problem definition that we used. The qualitative description for this problem is given in Table 6.8. First, the feed to the column is described. It is a multicomponent mixture consisting of six substances (Propane, n-Butane, Butene-1, trans-Butene-2, cis-Butene-2, n-Pentane). <p> The heuristics in the Challenge-Heuristic-10 class notice that the separation in COLUMN1 is much easier than the one in COLUMN2. It has been observed that choosing a very easy separation at some stage may not always lead to an optimum design <ref> [43] </ref>, since the next separation may be a very difficult one. In order to explore this possibility the heuristics in class Challenge-Heuristic-10 evolve a new design, excluding the use of alt-1 as a possible separation for COLUMN1. The flowsheet shown in part (a) of Figure 6.12 is created. <p> The final flowsheet is shown in part (b) of Figure 6.12. No more evolutionary heuristics are applicable at this point and OUZO exits with the flowsheet in part (a) of Figure 6.12 as the proposed design. The design trace is consistent with the one reported in <ref> [43] </ref>. 176 6.4.3 Results Table 6.7 presents the performance results for the n-Butylene purification problem. The Designs column in the table refers to the number of designs examined by the system until an optimal solution was found. <p> It took four flowsheets for the Nath & Motard strategy to come up with a final design. All of the results were consistent with the ones reported in [54], <ref> [43] </ref>. 6.5 Discussion Despite the fact that OUZO is able to deal with fairly complex problems the run times for most of the examples are not optimal. In particular, most of the running time for the program ( 80%) is spent in the qualitative analysis stage.

Reference-contexts: Designers for multicomponent separation systems use a set of nineteen general heuristics to construct an initial separation flowsheet (see Table 5.1 taken from <ref> [45] </ref>). In addition to these heuristics, evolutionary design methods use their own sets of heuristics for refining the initial structure. The heuristic library in OUZO contains fourteen general heuristics along with nine evolutionary heuristic rules for multicomponent separation systems. <p> Control system synthesis, in particular, presents a major challenge for our approach, since 191 critical design decisions like the establishment of critical variables or the identification of significant interactions between design features and steady-state control are largely based on qualitative knowledge (e.g. order of magnitude reasoning) <ref> [45] </ref>. Other engineering domains where there is a singificant interest in using AI techniques (e.g. mechanical or aeronautical engineering) pose a new set of challenges for our approach.

Reference-contexts: These include the minimum and the actual reflux ratios for the column under each separation (Min-Reflux-Ratio and Reflux-Ratio respectively), the relative volatilities for the possible keys at operating conditions, the Phi quantity which is a special-purpose quantity used in the Underwood method <ref> [54] </ref> for calculating minimum reflux ratios and the minimum number of stages for each alternative.

The analysis of multicomponent columns is based on a simplified version of the Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland method <ref> [54] </ref> for multicomponent distillation. The major steps are: 114 1.

Since we assume that we have sharp separation units, all the nonkey components end up in one of the products. <p> Calculate the minimum theoretical stages for the desired separation.

The traces for both methods are described below. 6.3.1 The Nath & Motard Strategy Trace The design process begins with a qualitative and numerical analysis of the problem description. <p> Also, alt-5 and alt-1 are found better than all the extractive distillation alternatives by the Ordinary-vs-Extractive-Distillation heuristic in the Perform-Least-Tight-Separation-First class (Figure 5.7). Finally, the small difference in the relative volatilities between alt-5 and alt-1 (&lt; *alpha-difference*) triggers the Difficulty-of-Separation-2 heuristic (Figure 5.7). Similar to what happens in <ref> [54] </ref> the user is prompted to select the most promising split. We choose alt-1 in order to be consistent with [54] and the heuristics in class Order-Choices (Figure 5.3) update the focus environment to reflect this development. <p> Finally, the small difference in the relative volatilities between alt-5 and alt-1 (&lt; *alpha-difference*) triggers the Difficulty-of-Separation-2 heuristic (Figure 5.7).

No more evolutionary heuristics are applicable at this point and the design system exits with F-3 as the proposed design. The design trace is consistent with the one reported in <ref> [54] </ref>. 6.4.2 The Nath & Motard Strategy Trace The design process begins by creating the description for the first column (COL-UMN1) in the separation system in a way similar to what is the case for the Seader & Wsterberg strategy in section 6.4.1. <p> It took four flowsheets for the Nath & Motard strategy to come up with a final design.

Reference-contexts: There are many ways in which models may vary from each other. Some of these include the ontologies they use, their scope, the domain of applicability, their accuracy and the resolution they offer <ref> [67] </ref>. The scope of a model refers to the range of phenomena it describes. Its domain of applicability specifies the constraints and/or the parameter values under which the model is valid. The accuracy of the model indicates how close are the model predictions with the observed behavior. <p> Accuracy and computational efficiency play equally important roles in model selection. Therefore, the compositional modeling techniques in our approach need to be extended to capture the effects of these additional parameters during the analysis phase.

Reference-contexts: The Critical-Pressure and Critical-Temperature quantities indicate the conditions under which each substance reaches its critical point. The critical point is a set of conditions under which all three phases for a substance are present. The Alpha-1, Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 quantities correspond to the Antoine equation coefficients <ref> [72] </ref> for the substance. This equation provides a way of calculating the vapor pressure of a substance based on its critical pressure and its temperature. The K-Ideal-Reference-Temperature for the substance is a reference temperature used in the calculation of the equilibrium ratios for the substance. <p> In particular, extractive distillation is based on the addition of a polar solvent in a mixture that can change the relative volatilities between the substances in the feed mixture.
