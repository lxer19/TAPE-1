Title: Conceptual Analogy  
Author: Katy Borner

Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is an approach that integrates conceptualization, i.e., memory organization based on prior experiences and analogical reasoning (Borner 1994a). It was implemented prototypically and tested to support the design process in building engineering (Borner and Janetzko 1995, Borner 1995). There are a number of features that distinguish CA from standard approaches to CBR and AR. First of all, CA automatically extracts the knowledge needed to support design tasks (i.e., complex case representations, the relevance of object features and relations, and proper adaptations) from attribute-value representations of prior layouts. Secondly, it effectively determines the similarity of complex case representations in terms of adaptability. Thirdly, implemented and integrated into a highly interactive and adaptive system architecture it allows for incremental knowledge acquisition and user support. This paper surveys the basic assumptions and the psychological results which influenced the development of CA. It sketches the knowledge representation formalisms employed and characterizes the sub-processes needed to integrate memory organization and analogical reasoning.

Reference-contexts: The latter is used if generalization or abstraction is applied to derive the common structure, i.e., prototype of a case class. Combinations of generalization and abstraction and/or geometrical transformations are possible, cf. <ref> (Borner 1994b) </ref>. Weighted modifications are employed to denote the degree of difficulty in learning the case class 3 , its size 4 , the variability of its instances 5 , and the diag-nosticity of certain case attributes 6 . <p> Weights on modifications induce some ordering of the application of c rules. Similarity is defined by identity or subsumption of the modified problem situation and the prototype, cf. <ref> (Borner 1994b) </ref>. The applied definition of structural similarity provides not only the most appropriate category it also mediates and guides solution transfer and adaptation. Similarity depends on the relevance of case features and the adaptation knowledge available.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2 depicts these four strongly interacting processes. Grounding Conceptual analogy conforms with the assumption that it is impossible to foresee and handcode all the memory structures (i.e., cases, similarity relations, and adaptation knowledge) that might be needed to handle different design tasks <ref> (Brooks and Stein 1993) </ref>. Consequently, the computation of memory structures needs to be grounded on the exchange of attribute-value representations of concrete experiences and the tasks of the system.

Reference-contexts: It should be mentioned that most work in case-based design and case-based planning follows a solution path perspective. For example, derivational analogy <ref> (Carbonell and Veloso 1988) </ref> constructs cases from derivational traces of planning episodes. Cases represent knowledge about how to derive solutions for problems and are employed to support reasoning. This works well if operational knowledge is actually available. In our domain prior layouts are the main knowledge source.

Reference-contexts: During extrapolation case classes are fur-ther divided to better reflect the common structure of cases. As for construction, algebraic case representations (e.g., terms without variables) are the basis for inductive determination of the prototype and corresponding weighted modifications for every case class. As proposed by <ref> (Gero 1990) </ref>, the prototype represents common features by constants or functions. Distinctive features are represented by variables. The c rules and the a rules define the replacement of subterms with variables and how variables may be instantiated, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Thus different tasks require different interpretations of and different solutions to solve the attribute-value description of the problem. that properly connect the outlet to the single accesses (pipes are represented by line segments). As the basic knowledge representation we employ A4 <ref> (Hovestadt 1993) </ref>, developed at the Institute of Industrial Building Design, University of Karlsruhe, Ger-many. It represents every designed object by its geometric attribute values (i.e., placement and extension in three dimensions) and its type attribute values (e.g., room, door, furniture, lamp, etc.).

Reference-contexts: Conceptualization As for conceptualization, pragmatic and structural features force the bottom-up acquisition and organization of past experience. Aiming at the support of design tasks there are no natural units that may define the granularity of cases 2 . The methodology of task-oriented knowledge acquisition <ref> (Janetzko, Borner, Jaschke and Strube 1994) </ref> may be applied here.

Reference-contexts: Due to its complexity, there is hardly any operational information available on how to support design steps. Architects frequently use prior CAD layouts to inspire and guide their work. This points to case-based reasoning (Cbr) <ref> (Kolodner 1993, Aamodt and Plaza 1994) </ref> as the predominant problem solving method. A typical subtask occurring in building engineering is the design of interconnections between accesses and outlets. Fig. 1 (left) depicts a collection of accesses (represented by small squares) and one outlet (indicated by a larger square).

Reference-contexts: A fixed quality threshold value determines the number of case classes representing a set of cases. With a 7 The definition of a prototype is similar to the definition of least general antiunifier (au) <ref> (Muggleton 1992) </ref>, or most specific generalization (msg) of a set of terms (Plotkin 1970).

Reference-contexts: Prior CAD layouts are retrieved and adapted to solve actual design problems. Due to the characteristics of the domain several problems arise. First of all, graphical user interaction has been identified as a desirable feature of design support systems <ref> (Pearce, Goel, Kolodner, Zimring, Sentosa and Billing-ton 1992) </ref>. This restricts the input and output of Cbd systems to CAD layouts, i.e., to sets of designed objects each represented by its attribute values.

Reference-contexts: Following <ref> (Ram 1993) </ref>, CA uses two processes for the bottom-up conceptualization. Firstly, the incremental construction of memory structures from input data and secondly, the extrapolation, i.e., the extension of existing memory structures in response to novel and unfamiliar situations.

Reference-contexts: Memory Structure Memory structures in CA represent each case class by a prototype and the set of weighted modifications which lead to the prototype when applied to the cases. Corresponding to psychological work, the term prototype refers either to a best instance of a case class <ref> (Rosch 1975) </ref>, or to an abstract description of a CC that is more appropriate to some members than it is to others (Smith, Osherson, Rips and Keane 1988). The former holds if background knowledge (e.g., geometrical transformations) is available, which reduces every case into one unique instance of the CC.
