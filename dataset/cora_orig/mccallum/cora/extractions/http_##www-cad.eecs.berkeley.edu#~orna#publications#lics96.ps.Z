Reference-contexts: Claim 3 follows from Lemma 4.2 and the fact that BW = RW . Finally, Claim 2 follows from Theorem 3.1.

Reference-contexts: It is known, for example, that formulas of CTL can be translated to BT [VW86b]. As the LTL formula F Gp can not be translated to a DBW , it follows from Theorem 4.3 that the CTL ? formula AF Gp can not be expressed in CTL <ref> [EH86] </ref> and that the CTL formula AF AGp is not strongly linear [CD88].
