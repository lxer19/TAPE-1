Reference-contexts: So although Biacino and Gerla's theorem is the kind of result needed to validate a mereotopological calculus, the particular interpretation to which it applies is too weak to be topologically interesting. Another approach to mereotopology in which semantics plays an important part is taken by Asher and Vieu <ref> [1] </ref>. They present a calculus|also based on a binary relation of connection|together with 1 a formal semantics in which the individuals are identified with certain subsets of a particular type of topological space. Soundness and completeness proofs are duly provided.

Reference-contexts: More technically, we must ask whether physical space|at least approximately, and on everyday scales|is a model of the proposed axioms under the intended interpretation, and if so, how completely those axioms capture its features. This question has been answered for Clarke's system by Biacino and Gerla <ref> [2] </ref>, who prove a completeness result guaranteeing that the regular sets of a Euclidean space are a model of Clarke's axioms (regular sets are explained below).

Reference-contexts: Since we can choose ff i;1 , ff i;2 and ff i;3 so that they intersect only at q i , this gives us a planar embedding of the graph K 3;3 , which is well-known to be non-planar (see, e.g. Bollobas <ref> [3] </ref>, p.19). 2 Lemma 4.13 Let r; s; t 2 S be Jordan regions such that r s t = 1 and r + s and r + t are connected. Then F (r) " F (s) and F (r) " F (t) are Jordan arcs. <p> It is well-known that every finite plane graph G in the closed plane can be continuously deformed into piecewise linear plane graph G 0 . (See, e.g. Bollobas <ref> [3] </ref>, p.16.) Indeed, this can be done in such a way that piecewise linear edges in G are unaffected. In effect, finite plane graphs can have their edges `straightened out' by a homeomorphism, without affecting any points in those faces whose frontiers involve only straight edges. <p> Axiom schema 4: By lemma 4.17. Axiom 5: Suppose r 1 ; : : : ; r 5 satisfied the condition inside the existential quantifiers. Then by lemma 4.9, we could construct a planar representation of the graph K 5 , which is known to be nonplanar (Bollobas <ref> [3] </ref>, p.19). Axiom 6: As for axiom 5, but with K 3;3 instead of K 5 . Axiom 7: The closed plane is connected. Axiom 8: Refer to fig. 5a). Let r x ; r y ; r z satisfy the antecedent of this axiom in S. <p> By a well-known theorem of Kuratowski, it suffices to show that G contains no subgraph identical to either K 5 or K 3;3 to within nodes of degree 2 (Bollobas <ref> [3] </ref>, p.19). For definiteness, we concentrate on the case K 5 . Let H be a subgraph of G identical to K 5 to within nodes of degree 2.

Reference-contexts: Recent interest in "mereotopology", much of it from within the AI community, dates from the work of Clarke [5],[6], following earlier work of Whitehead [13]. See, for example, Randall, Cui and Cohn [11], Gotts, Gooday and Cohn [7], and Borgo, Guarino and Masolo <ref> [4] </ref>. A mereotopological calculus is an axiomatic system in a formal language whose variables are to be thought of as ranging over spatial regions, and whose non-logical constants are to be thought of as expressing primitive topological properties and relations involving these regions.

Reference-contexts: We say that x X is regular if x = x 00 . The following well-known theorem underlies the importance of the regular sets to mereotopology. We state it here without proof. (See, e.g. Johnstone <ref> [8] </ref>, chapter I, section 1.13.) Theorem 2.1 Let X be a topological space.

Reference-contexts: Now p 2 and q 2 lie in the same component of Z 2 n (r x n jfl 1 j), since p 2 2 [y], q 2 2 [z] and fl 1 connects [y] and [z]. It is a standard result (Newman <ref> [9] </ref>, chapter V., 16 theorem 11.7) that, if fl is a cross-cut in a nonempty open connected set U with endpoints in the same component of Z 2 n U then U n jflj has two components.

Many of these facts are obvious and some readers may therefore wish to skip to the next section.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps, then, we can develop more efficient and parsimonious ways of representing and reasoning about space by taking regions, rather than points, as primitive. The best known theory of this kind is Tarski's <ref> [12] </ref> axiomatization of Euclidean geometry based on spheres. But the policy of taking regions as primitive is perhaps most attractive when considering problems involving mereological (part-whole) and other topological notions|that is, where no metric information is to hand.

Reference-contexts: The case K 3;3 proceeds identically, except that we rely on axiom 6. 2 Definition 5.2 Let G be a plane graph. Its geometric dual G fl is obtained in the following way (cf. <ref> [14] </ref>, p.72). A point v fl i is chosen inside each face of G. These chosen points are the nodes of G fl .
