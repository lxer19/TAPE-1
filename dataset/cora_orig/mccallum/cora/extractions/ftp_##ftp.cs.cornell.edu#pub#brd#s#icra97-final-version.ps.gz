Abstract: Distributed manipulation experiments were performed using a massively-parallel, microfabricated actuator array. An organic ciliary array of thin-film polyimide bi-morph microactuators exploiting combined thermal and electrostatic control was employed to implement task-level, sensorless manipulation strategies for macroscopic objects. The tasks of parts-translation, -rotation, -orientation, and -centering were demonstrated using small integrated circuit (IC) dice. Strategies were programmed in a fine-grained SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) fashion by specifying planar force vector fields. When a part is placed on the array, the programmed vector field induces a force and moment upon it. The part's equilibrium states may be predicted and cascaded (using a sequence of fields) to bring the part to a desired final state.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The theory of programmable vector fields 1 <ref> [2] </ref> arguably represents the first systematic attack on massively-parallel distributed manipulation based on geometric and physical reasoning.

Vector fields with potential have been shown to be theoretically well-suited for manipulation strategies, by classifying a sub-family of potential fields in which every part has stable equilibria [2]. <p> potential exists, it always lifts to a smooth configuration space (R 2 fi S 1 ) potential for the manipulated part <ref> [2] </ref>. Vector fields with potential have been shown to be theoretically well-suited for manipulation strategies, by classifying a sub-family of potential fields in which every part has stable equilibria [2]. Hence, such fields have been proposed for manipulation tasks in which we desire to cascade equilibria in order to uniquely pose or orient a part [3]. The theory of programmable vector fields permits calculation of stable equilibria for macroscopic parts in potential fields [2] (see Figure 12). 2 In our <p> which every part has stable equilibria <ref> [2] </ref>. Hence, such fields have been proposed for manipulation tasks in which we desire to cascade equilibria in order to uniquely pose or orient a part [3]. The theory of programmable vector fields permits calculation of stable equilibria for macroscopic parts in potential fields [2] (see Figure 12). 2 In our new experiments, we 2 While this question has been well-studied for a point mass in a field, the issue is more subtle when lifted to a body with finite area, of different sizes are first centered and subsequently separated depending on their size. <p> Reproduced from <ref> [2] </ref>. employed vector fields with potential for parts-orientation and -posing tasks, and the theory was used to predict the equilibrium poses of specific parts (Figure 11). The poses predicted by the equilibrium analysis were observed in our experiments (Figures 10-left). <p> The poses predicted by the equilibrium analysis were observed in our experiments (Figures 10-left). Perhaps surprisingly, the theory has also predicted the existence of pathological fields which do not induce well-behaved equilibria. In particular, the "lower bounds" of <ref> [2] </ref> show that there exist perfectly plausible vector fields which induce no stable equilibrium in very simple parts. Although these fields are very simple, they result in limit cycles and quite complex behavior. We implemented such fields on the cilia array. <p> These experiments suggest that MEMS actuator arrays are useful for parts-orientation, -posing, -transfer, -singulation, and -sorting.

P is in orientational equilibrium if the moments acting on P are balanced. Total equilibrium is simultaneous translational and orienta-tional equilibrium. Claim 3 <ref> [2] </ref> Every squeeze field f (see Definition 1) has potential, of the form U (z) = Z f ds, where ff is an arbi trary path to z from a fixed reference point. <p> If d z denotes the perpendicular distance of z from the squeeze line, then U (d z ) = jd z j. Claim 4 <ref> [2] </ref> Let P be a connected polygonal part with finite contact area and n vertices. Then in any squeeze field, P has O (kn 2 ) orientation equilibria, where k is the maximum number of edges that a bisector of P can cross. <p> If P is convex, then the number of equilibria is O (n). Equilibria can be calculated numerically or, for polygonal parts, exactly: see Figure 12 and <ref> [2] </ref> for details. Claim 5 [2] Let P be a polygon whose interior is connected. There exists a sensorless alignment strategy consisting of a sequence of squeeze patterns that uniquely orients P up to symmetries. <p> If P is convex, then the number of equilibria is O (n).

There exists a sensorless alignment strategy consisting of a sequence of squeeze patterns that uniquely orients P up to symmetries. <p> Parts may exhibit several equilibria, hence after one squeeze the part orientation may be ambiguous. This ambiguity can be removed with the strategies of Claim 5: by executing a sequence of squeezes at particular angles, the part is uniquely oriented (see Figure 2, for details see <ref> [2] </ref>). Experiments and Results. The long, thin part depicted in Figures 10-left and 11 exhibits a unique stable equilibrium (modulo 180 ffi field symmetry). When placed in a squeeze field, its longitudinal axis aligns with the squeeze line. <p> This part alignment experiment has also been performed with similar results for several other small pieces of glass and silicon of a few mm length and several mg of mass. 4.2 Skewed Squeeze Fields Definition 6 <ref> [2] </ref> A skewed field f S is a vector field given by f S (x; y) = sign (x)(1; *), where 0 6= * 2 R. field (* = 1).

Claim 9 A diagonally skewed field (* = 1) induces no stable equilibrium on a square-shaped part. <p> The square with center on the squeeze line will rotate indefinitely. Moreover, it has no stable equilibrium in this field. Claim 7 <ref> [2] </ref> No skewed squeeze field has a potential.
