Title: On Open Defaults  
Author: Vladimir Lifschitz and

Abstract: In Reiter's default logic, the parameters of a default are treated as metavariables for ground terms. We propose an alternative definition of an extension for a default theory, which handles parameters as genuine object variables. The new form of default logic may be preferable when the domain closure assumption is not postulated. It stands in a particularly simple relation to circumscription. Like circumscription, it can be viewed as a syntactic transformation of formulas of higher order logic.

These subsets will be important in view of their good computational properties.

Reference-contexts: As our starting point, we take a characterization of extensions for the case of closed defaults based on <ref> [ Guerreiro and Casanova, 1990 ] </ref> . This characterization uses a fixpoint construction which is similar to Reiter's, except that the fixpoints in question are classes of models, rather than sets of sentences. <p> In the realm of models, we can talk about elements of the universe directly. In Section 2 we review, for motivation and further reference, the fixpoint constructions from [ Reiter, 1980 ] and <ref> [ Guerreiro and Casanova, 1990 ] </ref> . The new definition of an extension is given in Section 3. Then we discuss its relation to traditional default logic (Section 4) and to circumscription (Section 5). <p> This largest V 0 always exists: Proposition 1. The union of all classes V 0 of models of W which satisfy (flfl) satisfies (flfl) also. This class V 0 is denoted by (V ). As essentially established in <ref> [ Guerreiro and Casanova, 1990 ] </ref> , extensions can be characterized in terms of the fixpoints of : Proposition 2. A set of sentences is an extension for (D; W ) if and only if it has the form Th (V ) for some fixpoint V of . <p> of (D; W; C) if and only if B is logically entailed by DL (D; W; C). 8 Related Work The correspondence between extensions and classes of models on which our main definition is based was first used by Etherington [1987b], although his construction is less transparent than that of <ref> [ Guerreiro and Casanova, 1990 ] </ref> . The possibility of introducing "nonground instances of defaults" is discussed by Poole [1987b] for his formulation of default logic, equivalent to the normal subset of Reiter's 9 system.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the problem of finding precise equivalence results for Konolige's translation turned out to be quite difficult. Several "groundedness" conditions have been proposed in order to filter out the autoepistemic extensions that have no counterparts in default logic. The first attempt <ref> [ Konolige, 1988 ] </ref> was unsuccessful, and this has led to the invention of "supergrounded" and "robust" extensions (see ( [ Marek and Truszczynski, 1989 ] , Sections 2.3 and 3).

Reference-contexts: Konolige [1989] discusses another approach; he also studies the problem of reducing circumscription to autoepistemic logic without assuming domain closure. Introspective circumscription <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1989b ] </ref> is a system analogous to au-toepistemic logic, in which unrestricted quantification is allowed. Like the formalism of this paper, it subsumes some forms of "minimizing" circumscription.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Default logic <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> is one of the most expressive and most widely used nonmono-tonic formalisms. In one respect, however, the main definition of default logic, that of an extension, is not entirely satisfactory. <p> In the realm of models, we can talk about elements of the universe directly. In Section 2 we review, for motivation and further reference, the fixpoint constructions from <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> and [ Guerreiro and Casanova, 1990 ] . The new definition of an extension is given in Section 3. Then we discuss its relation to traditional default logic (Section 4) and to circumscription (Section 5). <p> Related work is surveyed in Section 8. Most proofs are deferred to the appendix. 2 Extensions According to Reiter and Guerreiro Casanova According to <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> , a default theory (in a given first order language) is a pair (D; W ), where D is a set of defaults of the form (1), and W is a set of sentences. <p> Perhaps we will not have to select any one of the classical approaches ( [ McCarthy, 1980 ] , [ McDermott and Doyle, 1980 ] , <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> ) as a basis for the nonmonotonic formalism of the future, and reject the others; we may be able to combine the advantages of different models of nonmonotonic reasoning in the same system.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the availability of an epistemic modal operator is an attractive feature of a knowledge representation language, in connection with the problem of representing integrity constraints <ref> [ Reiter, 1988 ] </ref> . Hopefully, future research will lead to the invention of an elegant modal system, such that default logic will be linked to it by means of Konolige's translation or a similar mechanism.
