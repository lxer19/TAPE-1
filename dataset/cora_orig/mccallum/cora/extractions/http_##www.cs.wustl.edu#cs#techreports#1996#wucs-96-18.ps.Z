Abstract: We are also working on creating an H.261 gateway to allow conferencing with low bandwidth sources. Presently, the connection management system is centralized, so this limits the scalability of the system. This centralization occurs in both the Playground and the ATM connection management systems. In the next implementation of Playground, the connection management system will be distributed this will solve the problem in Playground. The ATM connection management system is centralized because we are using dynamic PVCs. By switching to SVCs, we should also be able to distribute the ATM system. We thank Bala Swaminathan and Ram Sethuraman for their work in developing the Playground library. This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants CCR-91-10029 and CCR-94-12711, and by the Advanced Research Projects Agency under contract DABT-63-95-C-0083.
