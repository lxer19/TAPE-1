Abstract: Shape modeling is an important constituent of computer vision as well as computer graphics research. Shape models aid the tasks of object representation and recognition. This paper presents a new approach to shape modeling which retains some of the attractive features of existing methods, and overcomes some of their limitations. Our techniques can be applied to model arbitrarily complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made. A single instance of our model, when presented with an image having more than one object of interest, has the ability to split freely to represent each object. This method is based on the ideas developed by Osher and Sethian to model propagating solid/liquid interfaces with curvature-dependent speeds. The interface (front) is a closed, nonintersecting, hypersurface flowing along its gradient field with constant speed or a speed that depends on the curvature. It is moved by solving a "Hamilton-Jacobi" type equation written for a function in which the interface is a particular level set. A speed term synthesized from the image is used to stop the interface in the vicinity of object boundaries. The resulting equation of motion is solved by employing entropy-satisfying upwind finite difference schemes. We present a variety of ways of computing evolving front, including narrow bands, reinitializations, and different stopping criteria. The efficacy of the scheme is demonstrated with numerical experiments on some synthesized images and some low contrast medical images.

A complete discussion of the narrow band techniques for interface propagation may be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. As a consequence of our update strategy, the front can be moved through a maximum distance of ffi=2, either inward or outward, at which point we must rebuild an appropriate (a new) narrow band. <p> With our relatively simple speed motion, the free-end boundary condition is adequate, however, in more complex applications such as crystal growth, and flame propagation, accurate specification of boundary conditions is necessary <ref> [1] </ref>. We now show that this new faster approach provides a correct approximation to the propagating front problem. In figure (6), we show the result of applying narrow-band algorithm to a star shaped front propagating with speed F = K, where K is the curvature as in equation (11).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper, we describe a modeling technique based on a level set approach for recovering shapes of objects in two and three dimensions from various types of image data. The modeling technique may be viewed as a form of active modeling such as "snakes" <ref> [15] </ref> and deformable surfaces [34] since, the model which consists of a moving front, may be molded into any desired shape by externally applied halting criteria synthesized from the image data. <p> Generalized spline models with continuity constraints are well suited for fulfilling the goals of shape recovery (see [6, 33]). Generalized splines are the key ingredient of the dynamic shape modeling paradigm introduced to vision literature by Kass et 2 al. <ref> [15] </ref>. Incorporating dynamics into shape modeling enables the creation of realistic animation for computer graphics applications and for tracking moving objects in computer vision. <p> Incorporating dynamics into shape modeling enables the creation of realistic animation for computer graphics applications and for tracking moving objects in computer vision. Following the advent of the dynamic shape modeling paradigm <ref> [15, 34] </ref>, considerable research followed, with numerous application specific modifications to the modeling primitives, and external forces derived from data constraints [39, 18, 11, 24, 36, 37].

To make the final result relatively insensitive to the initial conditions, Cohen [10] suggested the use of an inflation force which makes the snake behave like an edge seeking active model. <p> Since the idea is to extract objects' shapes from a given image, the front should be forced to stop in the vicinity of the desired objects' boundaries. This is analogous to the force criterion used to push the active contour model towards desired shapes <ref> [15] </ref>. We define the final shape to be the configuration when all the points on the front come to a stop, thereby bringing the computation to an end. <p> This (diffusion) term smooths out the high curvature regions of the front and has the same regularizing effect on the front as the internal deformation energy term in thin-plate-membrane splines <ref> [15] </ref> (see the figure (9)). <p> Clearly, with every increment in the value of ", the level set f = 0g attains a configuration that is relatively smoother. This is analogous to the smoothness provided by the second order term in the internal energy of a thin flexible rod <ref> [15] </ref>. In our third experiment we recover the complicated structure of an arterial tree. The real image has been obtained by clipping a portion of a digital subtraction angiogram. This is an example of a shape with extended branches or significant protrusions.

Reference-contexts: We show that by using our approach, it is also possible to extract the bounding contours of shapes with holes in a seamless fashion (see figure 13). Our method is inspired by ideas first introduced in Osher and Sethian <ref> [23, 29] </ref>, which grew out of work in Sethian [28], to model propagating fronts with curvature-dependent speeds. Two such examples are flame propagation and crystal growth, in which the speed of the moving interface normal to itself depends on transport terms modified by the local curvature. <p> The challenge in these problems is to devise numerical schemes for the equations of the propagating front which will accurately approximate these highly unstable physical phenomena. Osher and Sethian <ref> [23] </ref> achieve this by viewing the propagating surface as a specific level set of a higher-dimensional function. The 4 equation of motion for this function is reminiscent of an initial value "Hamilton-Jacobi" equation with a parabolic right-hand side and is closely related to a viscous hyperbolic conservation law. <p> In section 5, we present some experimental results of applying our method to some synthetic and low contrast medical images. We conclude in section 6. 2 Front Propagation Problem In this section we present the level set technique due to Osher and Sethian <ref> [23] </ref>. For details and an expository review, see Sethian [29]. <p> Third, topological changes are difficult to manage as the evolving interface breaks and merges. And fourth, significant bookkeeping problems occur in the extension of this technique to three dimensions. As an alternative, the central idea in the level set approach of Osher and Sethian <ref> [23] </ref> is to represent the front fl (t) as the level set f = 0g of a function . <p> The first is that the evolving function (x; t) always remains a function as long as F is smooth. However, the level surface f = 0g, and hence the propagating hypersurface fl (t) may change topology, break, merge, and form sharp corners as the function evolves, see <ref> [23] </ref>. 7 The second advantage of this Eulerian formulation concerns numerical approximation. Because (x; t) remains a function as it evolves, we may use a discrete grid in the domain of x and substitute finite difference approximations for the spatial and temporal derivatives. <p> This entropy condition yields the front which corresponds to the limiting solution as " ! 0 of the smooth case. In order to build a correct entropy-satisfying approximation to the difference operator, we exploit the technology of hyperbolic conservation laws. Following <ref> [23] </ref>, we use a modification of an Engquist Osher schemes [12]. That is, given a speed function F (K), we update the front by the following scheme. <p> By simply extending the array structures and gradients operators, propagating surfaces are easily handled. Since its introduction in <ref> [23] </ref>, the above level set approach has been used in a wide collection of problems involving moving interfaces. Some of these applications include the generation of minimal surfaces [8], singularities and geodesics in moving curves and surfaces in [9], flame propagation [25, 40], fluid interfaces [31, 22]. <p> Our approach retains some of the desirable features of existing methods for shape modeling and overcomes some of their deficiencies. We adopt the level set techniques first introduced in Osher and Sethian <ref> [23] </ref> to the problem of shape recovery. With this approach, complex shapes can be recovered from images. The final result in our method is relatively independent of the initial guess. This is a very desirable feature to have, specially in applications such as automatic shape recovery from image data.

Reference-contexts: We show that by using our approach, it is also possible to extract the bounding contours of shapes with holes in a seamless fashion (see figure 13). Our method is inspired by ideas first introduced in Osher and Sethian [23, 29], which grew out of work in Sethian <ref> [28] </ref>, to model propagating fronts with curvature-dependent speeds. Two such examples are flame propagation and crystal growth, in which the speed of the moving interface normal to itself depends on transport terms modified by the local curvature. <p> These discrete markers are updated in time by approximating the spatial derivatives in the equations of motion, 5 and advancing their positions. However, there are several problems with this approach, as discussed in Sethian <ref> [28] </ref>. First, small errors in the computed particle positions are tremendously amplified by the curvature term, and calculations are prone to instability unless an extremely small time step is employed. <p> As brief motivation for these schemes, consider a periodic cosine curve propagating in its normal direction with speed F = 1 "K, where K is the curvature. This problem has been discussed extensively in <ref> [28] </ref>. For " &gt; 0, the front stays smooth for all time. For " = 0, the parameterized analytic solution corresponds to a front which passes through itself and develops a swallowtail solution.

For details and an expository review, see Sethian <ref> [29] </ref>. <p> The correct technique for approximating the spatial derivative in the above comes from respecting the appropriate entropy condition for propagating fronts, discussed in detail in <ref> [29] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In one space dimension, we have n+1 i t f (max (D i ; 0)) 2 g 1=2 F 1 (K)r n i Extension to higher dimensions are straightforward; we use the version given in <ref> [30] </ref>. 8 The third advantage of the above formulation is that intrinsic geometric properties of the front may be easily determined from the level function . <p> Thus, our goal is to construct an image-based speed function ^ F I that is globally defined. We call it an extension of F I off the level set f = 0g because it extends the meaning of F I to other level sets <ref> [30] </ref>. Note that the level set f = 0g lies in the image plane and therefore ^ F I must equal F I on f = 0g. The same argument applies to the coefficient k I . <p> The value of image-based speed term at the current point is simply its value at the point q. 2. With the value of extended speed term ( ^ k n I ) i;j and n i;j , calculate n+1 i;j using the upwind, finite difference schemes given in <ref> [30] </ref>. 3. Construct an approximation for the level set f = 0g from n+1 i;j . This is required to visualize the current position of the front in the image plane. A piecewise linear approximation for the front fl (t) is constructed as follows. <p> With the above value of extended speed term ( ^ k m I ) i;j and m i;j , calculate m+1 i;j using the upwind, finite difference scheme given in <ref> [30] </ref>. 4. Construct a polygonal approximation for the level set f = 0g from m+1 i;j . A contour tracing procedure is used to obtain a polygonal approximation.

Reference-contexts: Since its introduction in [23], the above level set approach has been used in a wide collection of problems involving moving interfaces. Some of these applications include the generation of minimal surfaces [8], singularities and geodesics in moving curves and surfaces in [9], flame propagation [25, 40], fluid interfaces <ref> [31, 22] </ref>. Extensions of the basic technique include fast methods in [1] and extensions to triple points in [3]. The fundamental Eulerian perspective presented by this approach has since been adopted in many theoretical analyses of mean curvature flow, in particular, see [13]. <p> However, this is an O (N 3 ) operation, if we assume that there are N points in each coordinate direction, plus approximately O (N ) points on the interfaces. An alternative to this reconstruction is provided by <ref> [31] </ref>, based on an idea of Morel.

Reference-contexts: In the context of static problems, more recently, particle systems have been used to model surfaces of arbitrary topology <ref> [32] </ref>. Here, particles can be added and deleted dynamically to enlarge and trim the surface respectively. The schemes described in this paper offer a new approach to some of the above problems. To begin, the convergence to the final result is relatively independent of the shape initialization.

Reference-contexts: The modeling technique may be viewed as a form of active modeling such as "snakes" [15] and deformable surfaces <ref> [34] </ref> since, the model which consists of a moving front, may be molded into any desired shape by externally applied halting criteria synthesized from the image data. <p> Incorporating dynamics into shape modeling enables the creation of realistic animation for computer graphics applications and for tracking moving objects in computer vision.

The final recovered shape in these schemes can depend on the initial guess made to start the numerical reconstruction procedure.
