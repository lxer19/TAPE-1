Title: TRANSFORM CODING USING ADAPTIVE BASES AND QUANTIZATION

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of universal transform coding based on estimating the Karhunen-Loeve transform from quantized data. The use of quantized data in the estimation allows the encoder and decoder to maintain the same state without any side information. A theorem is presented that proves, under certain conditions, that consistent estimation of all the required moments is possible from uniformly scalar quantized data regardless of the quantization coarseness. This consistent estimation requires the solution of nonlinear equations. Very simple approximations that avoid these nonlinear equations are used to develop a practical adaptive coding technique. Promising experimental results obtained with this method are presented.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Although there are many popular and effective adaptive lossless compression methods, such as Lempel-Ziv coding [1], dynamic Huffman coding [2], and arithmetic coding <ref> [3] </ref>, there are no adaptive lossy compression methods with such universal acceptance. A primary reason for this disparity is computational complexity: While asymptotically optimal universal lossy compression schemes have been presented in the literature, these schemes suffer from high complexity because they depend on high dimensional vector quantization.

Reference-contexts: In general, this approach will lead to a nonlinear system of equations relating the parameters and bin probabilities. Ortega and Vetterli <ref> [4] </ref> proposed using a continuous, piecewise linear model for the signal p.d.f. This method is particularly practical because it yields a tridiagonal linear system relating the parameters and bin probabilities.

Reference-contexts: In light of the desire for backward adaptivity, we would like to know how coarsely the data can be quantized and still allow model parameters to be determined. The answer was described first in <ref> [5] </ref> and is summarized below. Let X have a parametric p.d.f. f 1 ; 2 ;:::; k (x). <p> This method is particularly practical because it yields a tridiagonal linear system relating the parameters and bin probabilities. In addition, the performance is quite good even when the source p.d.f. can not be closely approximated by a piecewise linear function <ref> [5] </ref>. 3. ADAPTIVE VECTOR QUANTIZATION 3.1. Adaptive VQ with no side information One approach to backward adaptive VQ is to simply extend the ideas of the previous section. It is interesting to note that even very coarse scalar quantization can yield enough information to fit a reasonable parametric model.

Reference-contexts: Also, there is some performance penalty from the requirement that adaptation be strictly causal. A method for adaptive scalar quantization without side information ([4],[5]) is reviewed and generalization to vector quantization (VQ) is discussed. For adaptive VQ, a scheme using some side information is also presented <ref> [6] </ref>. The bulk of the paper addresses the issue of adaptive transform coding. It is shown that the transform (and, as above, the scalar quantizers) can be adapted based purely on past quantized data to give an optimal universal transform coding system. <p> One lower complexity alternative to adaptive VQ is presented in the following subsection. 3.2. Dictionary-based Adaptive VQ Given the difficulty in designing vector quantizers based on parametric source models, iterative approaches have normally been taken for this purpose. As an alternative, <ref> [6] </ref> presented a one-pass technique for VQ codebook construction and adaptation for individual source signals. The technique, called rate-distortion Lempel-Ziv (RDLZ), is an effort to extend the Lempel-Ziv algorithm to a practical universal lossy compression algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Recently, very good transform coding results have been reported using classification based methods, i.e. schemes in which the signal space is divided into a finite set of classes and a fixed transform is designed for each class <ref> [7] </ref>. Classification methods generally rely on training for defining classes and/or designing a transform code for each class. In this paper we consider only methods that do not rely on a priori training.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider only methods that do not rely on a priori training. The optimality of the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) for transform coding of a stationary source under high resolution and arbitrary real bit assignment assumptions is well known <ref> [8, x8.6] </ref>. Adaptive versions of KLT coding are not widely used because in traditional adaptive systems (with side information) transmission of the KLT coefficients can be prohibitively expensive. 2 By advocating a backward adaptive KLT, we completely avoid performance penalties associated with side information.
