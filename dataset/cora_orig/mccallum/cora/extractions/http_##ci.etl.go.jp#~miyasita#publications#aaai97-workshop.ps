Abstract: We propose a new integrated architecture for distributed planning and scheduling that exploits constraints for problem decomposition and coordination. Our goal is to develop an efficient method to solve densely constrained planning / scheduling problems in a distributed manner without sacrificing solution quality. We implemented a prototype system, called CAMPS, in which hierarchy of intelligent agents try to coordinate their actions for "satisficing" planning / scheduling results by handling several intra- and inter-agent constraints. In this paper, we show the repair-based methodology for distributed planning / scheduling and the constraint-based mechanism for dynamic coalition formation among agents.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In the research of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI), there has been research on cooperative distributed problem solving (CDPS) <ref> (Decker, Durfee, & Lesser 1989) </ref> or coordinated problem solving (Gasser & Hill 1990). In those systems, a loosely coupled distributed network of semi-autonomous agents, each of which is capable of sophisticated problem solving, cooperatively interact with other agents to solve a problem with a single goal (Lesser & Corkill 1987).

Reference-contexts: Overview of The Problem Our problem is formulated as a job shop planning / scheduling problem, which is a well-known NP-complete problem <ref> (French 1982) </ref>. In the problem, each job consists of a set of operations with fixed duration to be scheduled according to a partial operation ordering.

The planning and scheduling activities in a manufacturing enterprise can be naturally modeled as CDPS. The goal of planning / scheduling is, in its broadest sense, to maximize profit of the enterprise.

Reference-contexts: In our new architecture for distributed planning and scheduling, agents iteratively repair its local solution to pursue a globally "satisficing" result. In Anchor & Ascend approach by Liu <ref> (Liu 1996) </ref>, the specific problem structure such as bottleneck resources is used to control iterative repair by several agents while keeping search space of the agents tractable. But this approach is effective only when the appropriate problem structure exists for target objectives (e.g. bottleneck resources for tardiness minimization).

Reference-contexts: And in the study of distributed scheduling, the aim of the systems has been to find a feasible solution (CORTES (Sycara et al. 1991)) or a satisfactory solution in terms of a simple objective (e.g. time-shift preferences in DIS-DSS <ref> (Neiman, Hildum, & Lesser 1994) </ref>). In those systems, a solution is built constructively by scheduling agents which communicate abstract resource profiles and meta-level information (such as lending possibility) among them. The agent interaction is hard-coded a priori in the systems and can't be adjusted during the course of problem solving.
