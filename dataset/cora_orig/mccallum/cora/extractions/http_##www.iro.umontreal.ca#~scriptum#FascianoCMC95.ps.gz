Abstract: Graphics are often seen as an essential part of a report but their appropriate use has remained quite elusive. This work seeks to define the rules for the automatic generation of the appropriate graphics given an author's intention. We describe a system that implements these rules in the context of statistical reports.

Reference-contexts: on the graphics generation but the system does not need more information to generate the accompanying text that helps the reader to focus on the important points of the graphics. 1 2 Writer's intention and the characteristics of graphics Mackinlay [3] describes an algorithm based on the work of Bertin <ref> [1] </ref> who characterizes the variables as nominal, ordinal or quantitative. This algorithm specifies graphical methods for each type of variables. We adapted it by integrating some more theoretical results from Tufte [5, 6] and Zelazny [7].

Reference-contexts: A picture shows but a text describes. In a statistical report, graphics show the data that is analyzed in the text. This paper describes an important part of a system, called Postgraphe because it combines with a text generator called Pretexte <ref> [2] </ref>, which generates a report integrating graphics and text from a single set of writer's intentions. The system is given the data in tabular form as might be found in a spreadsheet; also input is a declaration of the types of values in the columns of the table.

Reference-contexts: We extended these findings to a whole set of graphics discussed in the full paper. While research has most often been on the reader's model <ref> [4] </ref>, we focus instead on the writer's intention and goals which influence the way the graphics are generated and combined with the text.
