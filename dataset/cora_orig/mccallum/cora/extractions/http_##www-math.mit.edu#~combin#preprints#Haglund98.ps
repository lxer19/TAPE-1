Title: FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING ROOK POLYNOMIALS WITH ONLY REAL ROOTS  
Author: James Haglund 
Date: March 12, 1998  
Note: Preprint,  
Abstract: We present a number of conjectures involving rook polynomials having only real zeros. Many of these generalize a previous conjecture of the author, K. Ono, and D. G. Wagner, namely that if A is a real n fi n matrix which is weakly increasing down columns, then the permanent of zA + J n has only real zeros. In some cases these conjectures are motivated by factorization theorems for Ferrers boards. Special cases are shown to follow from a theorem of Szego. We also present a weighted version of the Poset Conjecture of enumerative combinatorics.

Reference-contexts: Later we will use Newton's inequality [HLP,p.52], which says that if P n k=0 z k b k is a polynomial with only real nonpositive roots, then b 2 n 2 k1 k+1 Other inequalities satisfied by the coefficients were discovered by Aissen, Schoenberg, and Whitney <ref> [ASW] </ref>. The MCP Conjecture has a natural interpretation in terms of rook theory. A placement of rooks on the squares of A is nonattacking if no two rooks are in the same column, and no two are in the same row.

Reference-contexts: Recently the author, K. Ono, and D. G. Wagner made the following conjecture <ref> [HOW] </ref>: Monotone Column Permanent (MCP) Conjecture. Let A be a real n fi n matrix whose entries are weakly increasing down columns, i.e. a i;j a i+1;j . Then all of the roots of per (zA+J n ), viewed as a polynomial in z, are real. <p> Hence the MCP Conjecture implies that the hit polynomials of boards which are weakly increasing down columns have only real zeros. This case was proven in <ref> [HOW] </ref> as follows; by flipping these boards upside down, and permuting the columns (which doesn't change the rook numbers) appropriately, we can assume we are dealing with Ferrers boards.

Reference-contexts: If A is a board, then t k (A) is called the kth hit number, and equals the number of ways of placing n nonattacking rooks on A where exactly k rooks lie on nonzero entries <ref> [KaRi] </ref>. A Ferrers board is a board with the property that a ij = 1 =) a kp = 1 for 1 k i and j p n, i.e. all the entries of A to the right and above square (i; j) also equal 1. <p> (v) = f1 3 ; 2 1 g, the 4 permutations of M (v) are 1112 1121 1211 2111; and (3) reduces to 3z 2 + z. 4 JAMES HAGLUND Kaplansky and Riordan showed that m Y v i ! k1 is the hit polynomial for the "Simon Newcomb board" <ref> [KaRi] </ref> (see Fig. 2). This is the matrix where the entries in the first v 1 columns are all zero, the next v 2 columns have ones in the top v 1 rows and zeros below, etc.
