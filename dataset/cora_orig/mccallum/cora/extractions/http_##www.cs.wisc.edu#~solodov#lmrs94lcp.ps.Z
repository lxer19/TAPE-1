Abstract: Recently [MaS93] it was shown that every nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) is equivalent to the unconstrained minimization of a certain implicit Lagrangian. In particular, it was shown that this implicit Lagrangian is nonnegative everywhere and its set of zeros coincides with the solution set of the original NCP. In this paper, we consider the linear complementarity problem (LCP), and show that the distance to the solution set of the LCP from any point sufficiently close to the set can be bounded above by the square root of the implicit Lagrangian for the LCP. In other words, the square root of the implicit Lagrangian is a local error bound for the LCP. Our proof is based on showing that the square root of the implicit Lagrangian is equivalent to the residual function used in a known local error bound [Rob81, LuT92b]. When the matrix associated with the LCP is nondegenerate, the new error bound is in fact global. This extends the error bound result [MaP90] for the LCP with a P-matrix.

Reference-contexts: We need to make a definition. Definition 4.1. An nfin matrix Q is called nondegenerate if all of its principal minors are nonzero. For a discussion of such matrices see the recent book by Cottle, Pang and Stone <ref> [CPS92] </ref>. Recall that the class of P-matrices consists of those square matrices with positive principal minors. Thus, the class of nondegenerate matrices contains the class of P-matrices and hence the class of positive definite matrices. We now state and prove our global error bound result. Theorem 4.2. <p> For example, it contains the class of nondegenerate matrices, the class of P-matrices and the class of positive definite matrices. It also contains the class of strictly semimonotone matrices (see Theorem 3.9.11 of <ref> [CPS92] </ref> for the characterizations of such matrices). Our result is the following. Theorem 5.3. Let F (x) = Qx + q and ff &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: Using entirely different arguments, Fukushima <ref> [Fuk92] </ref> also showed the same result for ff = 1. Similar to (2.1), we let I x 11 and use N 0 (x; ff) to denote the partial derivative of N (x; ff) with respect to the parameter ff.

Reference-contexts: An error bound is global if it holds for all x. Error bounds for LCP and related problems have been well studied (see [LuT92c], [Man85], [MaS87] and [MaP90]) and have found many important applications in the convergence analysis of some well known algorithms (see [Pan87], <ref> [LuT92a] </ref>, [LuT92b]). These error bounds provide effective termination criteria for iterative algorithms (see [Pan86]) and can be used for sensitivity analysis when the problem data is subject to perturbation. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss some basic properties of the implicit Lagrangian M (x; ff).

Here, ffi and are two positive constants independent of x. To establish this equivalence, we need the following lemma. Lemma 3.1. Let ff &gt; 1.

We start with a globalization result which says that if an extra factor maxf1; kxkg is added to the right hand side of the error bound (3.5), then it becomes global. Theorem 4.1. Suppose P is nonempty.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the error bound (3.5) cannot hold for the sequence fx t g. In other words, (3.5) is not a global error bound in general. Another consequence of Theorem 3.1 has to do with the globalization of the error bound (3.5). In particular, in <ref> [Man92] </ref> it has recently been shown that, for the class of nondegenerate monotone LCPs (i.e., Q is positive semi-definite and there exists some x fl 2 P such that x fl + Qx fl + q &gt; 0), (1 + kxk)r (x), or by a slight change of the argument maxf1;

Reference-contexts: We assume throughout that the solution set of the above NCP, denoted by P , is nonempty. Recently <ref> [MaS93] </ref> an interesting relation between the NCP (1.1) and the following implicit Lagrangian for (1.1) was established M (x; ff) := 2ffhx; F (x)i + Here () + denotes the orthogonal projection operator onto the nonnegative orthant [0; 1) n , k k denotes the standard Euclidean 2-norm, and ff &gt; <p> Q.E.D. We remark that Lemmas 2.1-2.3 hold not just for LCP, but also for NCP, since we have not used the linearity of F in the proof of these lemmas. From these lemmas, we can easily infer the result of <ref> [MaS93] </ref>. In particular, for each ff &gt; 1, we have from Lemma 2.1 M (x; ff) = M (x; ff) M (x; 1) Z ff M 0 (x; fi)dfi 0; where the last step follows from M 0 (x; fi) 0 (cf. Lemma 2.3). <p> By Lemma 2.3, the latter condition is further equivalent to x 2 P . Thus, the zero set of M (x; ff) coincides with the solution set P of the NCP. This recovers Theorem 2.1 of <ref> [MaS93] </ref>. 3 A New Local Error Bound In this section, we shall establish the desired local error bound (1.3). <p> positive constant t such that dist (x; P ) t 1=2 (3) If an extra term maxf1; kxkg multiplies to each of these three quantities, then they each become a global upper bound for dist (x; P ). 5.2 Error Bounds Using the Restricted Implicit Lagrangian In Theorem 2.5 of <ref> [MaS93] </ref> it was also shown that, for positive ff, the zeros in the nonnegative orthant of the following restricted implicit Lagrangian N (x; ff) = 2ffhx; F (x)i + coincide with the solutions of the NCP. <p> These new error bounds are based on the implicit Lagrangian M (x; ff) recently introduced and studied in <ref> [MaS93] </ref>. It is interesting to note that these error bounds hold for all choices of the penalty parameter ff, so long as ff &gt; 1.

We briefly describe our notation. <p> Fix some ff &gt; 1, and then use Theorem 4.2 and the equivalence of r (x) and (M (x; ff)) 1=2 (see Theorem 3.1). Q.E.D. Theorem 4.3 strengthens the global error bound result by Mathias and Pang <ref> [MaP90] </ref> who showed that (4.7) holds when Q is a P-matrix. [Recall that any P-matrix is necessarily nondegen erate, but the converse is not true.] We remark that our proof of the global error bound result (4.7) is by way of the equivalence of r (x) and (M (x; ff)) 1=2
