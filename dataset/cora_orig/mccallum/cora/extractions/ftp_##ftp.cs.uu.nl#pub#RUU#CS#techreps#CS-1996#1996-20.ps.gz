Abstract: The probabilistic path planner (PPP) is a general planning scheme that yields fast robot path planners for a wide variety of problems, involving, e.g., high degree of freedom articulated robots, nonholonomic robots, and multiple robots. In this paper we go into theoretical aspects regarding the behaviour of PPP. We formulate general properties that guarantee probabilistic completeness of PPP, and we show how these apply to various robot types. Furthermore, we present results which, under certain assumptions on the free configuration space, give estimates of the expected running times. For example, under one such assumption, we show that the expected running time of PPP grows only logarithmically with the complexity of the problem that it solves.

Reference-contexts: PPP applied to tractor-trailer robots is the topic of [ SV95, S SLO95]. Probabilistic completeness of the planners for nonholonomic robots is proven in [ SO95b]. Recently some first results on the expected running times of PPP, under certain geometric assumptions on the free configuration space, have been obtained <ref> [KLMR95, KKL96, BKL + 95] </ref>.

Finally, extensions of PPP addressing multi-robot path planning problems have been presented in [ SO95a, SO96]. <p> In Section 2 the PPP-scheme is described (in a simplified form). In Section 3 probabilistic completeness of the method is discussed, and proofs of probabilistic completeness are given for various (holonomic and nonholonomic) robots.

In this way, we can give running time estimates for locally controllable nonholonomic robots that are realistic in the sense that we can actually build the planners that we analyse.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Robot path planning, which asks for the computation of collision free paths in environments containing obstacles, has received a great deal of attention in the last decades <ref> [Lat91, HA92] </ref>. We consider the basic problem, where there is one robot present in a static and known environment, and the task is to compute a collision-free path describing a motion that brings the robot from its current position to some desired goal position.

Reference-contexts: A first version of the planner for free-flying planar robots was described by Overmars in [Ove92] and subsequently expanded into a general learning approach, for various robot types, in [O S94]. Independently, "PPP-like" preprocessing schemes for holonomic robots where introduced in [KL94] and <ref> [HST94] </ref>. These schemes also build probabilistic roadmaps in the free C-space, but focus on the case robots with many degrees of freedom (dofs). In [K SLO95] the ideas developed in [O S94] and [KL94] have been combined, resulting in a even more powerful planner for high-dof robots.
