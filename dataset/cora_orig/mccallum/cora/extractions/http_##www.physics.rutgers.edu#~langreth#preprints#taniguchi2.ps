Abstract: Physical arguments and non-equilibrium calculations based on the time dependent Anderson model are given that the highly correlated Kondo and mixed valent states are under certain circumstances relevant for an atom in motion outside a metal surface. It is predicted that anomalous temperature, energy, or velocity dependence may as a result occur in physically measured properties.

Charge Transfer to an Atom Moving Away from a Surface We have recently proposed <ref> [23] </ref> that measurement of charge transfer to or from an atom scattering or desorbing from a metal surface may be an ideal way to observe the dramatic temperature dependent effects associated with the highly correlated mixed valent state Fig. 1 (b). <p> The effect also was found to occur over a wide range of velocities from 0.001 to 0.05 a.u. To eliminate Doppler broadening of the mixed valent resonance, which will weaken the effect, one should detect atoms escaping as close to the surface normal as possible. Careful estimates <ref> [23] </ref> show that substrate phonons do not significantly affect the results. <p> The cleanest recommended example of an N = 2 system which we recommend is of this type, consisting of alkaline earth atoms over noble metal surfaces. In Ref. <ref> [23] </ref> we discuss further systems and the possibility of larger N .
