Title: A PHONE-DEPENDENT CONFIDENCE MEASURE FOR UTTERANCE REJECTION

Abstract: An acoustic confidence measure for acceptance/rejection of recognition hypotheses for continuous speech utterances is proposed. This measure is useful for rejecting utterances that are out of domain, or contain out-of-vocabulary words or speech disfluencies. A phone-based approach is implemented so that a single global threshold can be applied to hypothesis rejection for any word sequence. Phone confidence is computed for each frame of speech as the posterior phone probability given the acoustic observation. Word sequence confidence is evaluated as the average phone confidence, either by weighting all frames equally or by normalizing by phone duration. The confidence measure is tested on a database of spoken company names. When normalized by phone duration, it achieves, in some cases with less computational expense, rejection performance comparable to a baseline system implementing a common filler-model approach. When all frames are equally weighted, performance is substantially poorer.

Reference-contexts: The ability to reject out-of-domain utterances is essential for the design of user-friendly interfaces. A number of rejection approaches have been suggested in the past for rejection of putative hits in keyword spotting (e.g., <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] </ref>), for detection of out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., [8]), and for utterance rejection (e.g., [8, 9]). Some of these systems use a filler model to match non- keyword speech. A typical filler model is a set of context- independent phonetic models. <p> Let O = fO 1 ; O 2 ; :::; O T g be the acoustic observation sequence for the utterance.

Note that b [1] = 1 and e [N ] = T . Although our recognition system uses context- dependent phones, context-independent phones are used (for implementation reasons) to calculate the acoustic confidence measure (ACM ), for which there are two variations, ACM 1 and ACM 2 .

The baseline uses a rejection model implemented previously in a number of other systems (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>), based on a filler model consisting of a set of context- independent phones. A weight is used to adjust the tradeoff between correct acceptance (i.e., not rejecting an in-domain utterance) and correct rejection performance (i.e., rejecting an out-of-domain utterance).

Also, some systems use anti- keyword models. For example, in the digit recognition system in <ref> [9] </ref>, for each digit, an anti-digit model was trained on all digits except the target digit. A central issue in all these approaches is the normalization of acoustic likelihood scores of recognition hypotheses. We propose a phone-based confidence measure for rejecting recognition hypotheses.
