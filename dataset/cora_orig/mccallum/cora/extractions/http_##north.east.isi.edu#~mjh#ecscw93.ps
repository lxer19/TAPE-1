Title: Support for Collaborative Authoring via Email: The MESSIE Environment  
Author: Martina Angela Sasse, Mark James Handley and Shaw Cheng Chuang

Abstract: Abstact: MESSIE is a collaborative authoring environment to support the production of large-scale documents by teams of geographically distributed groups of authors working with hetereogenous systems. The environment allows authors to submit text at various stages of gestation (e.g. list of topics, first draft) to a shared filestore via email. All authors collaborating on a document can read each others' contributions, and add suggestions, comments and additional material directly to the document. The system integrates automatically answered electronic mail, shared file store administration, and a version control tool in a UNIX environment. The paper describes design and implementation strategy, and reports observations and a number of changes which were made during a 4-month trial period with three collaborative authoring teams.

Reference-contexts: Being involved in many such projects, we began to look for collaboration support which could reduce the number of meetings related to joint authoring activities. We conducted a case study to investigate the use of Multimedia Conferencing as a support environment <ref> (Baydere et al., 1993) </ref>. We found that Multimedia Conferencing provided the rich channels of communication which creative groupwork supposedly requires (Chalfonte et al., 1991), and is normally only achieved through face-to-face meetings. Most teams of authors, however, do not have access to expensive Multimedia Conferencing systems.

Reference-contexts: For instance, if the system is to be strongly locally administered, providing a "delete" command for remote users may be undesirable. However, if the system is to be administered in a more distributed fashion, more powerful (and potentially dangerous) commands <ref> (as described by Borenstein, 1992) </ref> will need to be provided for remote use.

Reference-contexts: We found that Multimedia Conferencing provided the rich channels of communication which creative groupwork supposedly requires (Chalfonte et al., 1991), and is normally only achieved through face-to-face meetings. Most teams of authors, however, do not have access to expensive Multimedia Conferencing systems. Even if they did, previous research <ref> (Grudin, 1990) </ref> has shown that less technology-experienced users than the ones in the case study would be likely to reject such a sophisticated groupware system because of the learning overhead required. <p> We decided to start with a simple, basic environment and add functionality as requested by users. We adopted this design strategy in an attempt to dodge the fate of some sophisticated groupware systems, which were rejected by their intended users <ref> (Grudin, 1990) </ref>, and feel that the approach was successful. Clearly, there is some debate over exactly which commands should be provided for the users. This is largely due to different groups' models for interaction with the system.

Reference-contexts: It has been suggested that MESSIE be used for collaborative authoring of software. An--other project to which we aim to apply it is ESPRIT project MICE <ref> (Kirstein, 1992) </ref> to handle the booking of resources for full-scale video conferences between a number of European sites. In general, MESSIE may be suitable for many tasks that require loose collaboration, but where the overhead involved in porting synchronous software to all possible remote systems is too great.
