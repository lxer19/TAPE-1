Abstract: We introduce a new focus for data mining, which is concerned with knowledge discovery in image databases. We expect all aspects of data mining to be relevant to image mining but in this first work we concentrate on the problem of finding associations. To that end, we present a data mining algorithm to find association rules in 2-dimensional color images. The algorithm has four major steps: feature extraction, object identification, auxiliary image creation and object mining. Our algorithm is general in that it does not rely on any type of domain knowledge. A synthetic image set containing geometric shapes was generated to test our initial algorithm implementation. Our experimental results show that image mining is feasible. We also suggest several directions for future work in this area.

Reference-contexts: A blob is described by its color, texture and spatial descriptors. The descriptors are represented by multidimensional vectors. At this point, we will consider in detail, the problem of finding associations. The problem of generating association rules was first introduced in <ref> [1] </ref> and an algorithm called AIS was proposed for mining all association rules. In [13], an algorithm called SETM was proposed to solve this problem using relational operations. In [2], two algorithms called Apriori and AprioriTid were proposed. These algorithms achieved significant improvements over the previous algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Various content-based retrieval systems (QBIC, Chabot and Photobook) have focused on material-oriented queries and have used low-level image properties (e.g., color and texture) to implement these queries. On the other hand, a content-based retrieval system developed at the University of California at Berkeley <ref> [3, 5] </ref> focuses on object-oriented queries. That is, queries that search for images that contain particular objects. <p> The blobworld representation is based on image segmentation using the Expectation-Maximization 3 algorithm on combined color and texture features. The salient feature of the Berkeley work is their approach to object recognition. Their approach <ref> [3] </ref> is based on the construction of a sequence of successively abstract descriptors through a hierarchy of grouping and learning processes. The image descriptors at a low level are color, texture, contrast, polarity, etc. and the grouping is based on spatiotemporal coherence of the local descriptors.

Reference-contexts: Database mining is the process of generating high-level patterns that have acceptable certainty and are also interesting from a database of facts. Knowledge Discovery has been applied effectively to solve many diverse problems. Examples include discovering rules of mass spectrometry from spectrogram data <ref> [4] </ref>, assessment of credit card applicants [6], discovering rules for query optimization [17, 18], diagnosing diseases from medical data [14], inferring risk profiles of insurance policy holders [19], and so on. Knowledge discovery derives much of its success from reasoning techniques in artificial intelligence, expert systems, machine learning and statistics.

By preprocessing the image data, we will identify and label objects contained in the images using the image query processing algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. The output of the preprocessing step will be a set of records, R i , one for each image, containing the object identifiers for the objects contained in the image. This step is quite intensive since it is a similarity search between images, actually image descriptors. <p> The algorithm can handle such information without modification, provided those additional attributes are treated as boolean values. Similarity Function The similarity function <ref> [5] </ref> between two blobs is essential for our image mining program. This function takes four parameters, the two blobs to be compared, a similarity threshold and a vector of standard deviations.

Reference-contexts: The image descriptors at a low level are color, texture, contrast, polarity, etc. and the grouping is based on spatiotemporal coherence of the local descriptors. The central notion in grouping is coherence and four major issues have been identified in <ref> [8] </ref> which are segmenting images into coherent regions based on integrated region and contour descriptors; fusing color, texture and shape information to describe primitives; using learning techniques for developing the relationship between object classes and color, texture and shape descriptors; and classifying objects based on primitive descriptors and relationships between primitives. <p> This preprocessing can be done automatically. In a general image mining setting, having a human label every possible object in a vast collection of images is a daunting task. However, we intend to capitalize on the recent work in CBIR, in particular, Blobworld <ref> [8] </ref>. As discussed previously, we intend to build our data mining system on top of a content-based image retrieval system. One premise behind supporting object-based queries in a CBIR system is to eliminate the need for manual indexing of image content. The CBIR system we will use is from Berkeley [8]. <p> <ref> [8] </ref>. As discussed previously, we intend to build our data mining system on top of a content-based image retrieval system. One premise behind supporting object-based queries in a CBIR system is to eliminate the need for manual indexing of image content. The CBIR system we will use is from Berkeley [8]. We will refer to it as the Blobworld system. This system produces a blobworld representation of each image. A blob is just a 2-D ellipse which possesses a number of attributes. An image is made up of a collection of blobs, usually less than ten.

Reference-contexts: The information is a statement that describes the relationship among a set of objects contained in the database with a certain confidence such that the statement is in some sense simpler than enumerating all the relationships between the individual instances of objects <ref> [9] </ref>. For example, in a database of employees and their salaries, each instance represents the relationship between an individual employee and his salary.

Reference-contexts: With a CBIR system, users will be able to retrieve relevant images based on their contents. CBIR researchers have typically followed two distinct directions <ref> [10] </ref> based on * modelling the contents of the image as a set of attributes which is produced manually and stored, for example in a relational database 2 * using an integrated feature-extraction/object-recognition system. <p> Certainly tradeoffs must be made in building a CBIR system. For example, having automatic feature extraction is achieved at the expense of domain independence. Having a high degree of domain indepence is achieved by having a semiautomatic (or manual) feature extraction component. With CBIR systems <ref> [10] </ref>, querying is facilitated through generic query classes. Examples of some query classes include color, texture, shape, attributes, text and domain concepts. Color and texture queries allow users to formulate the description of the images to be retrieved in terms of like color and texture.

Reference-contexts: Efficiency is, in general, important for any computational problem. However, for database mining it also determines whether a particular technique can be applied or not. For example, the number of possible ways to cluster N objects into m clusters in unsupervised learning is exponential in N <ref> [12] </ref>. Hence, an algorithm which uses exhaustive search for clustering is impractical for real-world databases. In general any algorithm which grows faster than O (n 2 ) is unlikely to be useful for large databases. Over the years, database systems, mainly relational, have made great strides in improving efficiency.
