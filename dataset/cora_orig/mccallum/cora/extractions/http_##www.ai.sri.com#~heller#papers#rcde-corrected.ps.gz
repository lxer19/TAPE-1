Reference-contexts: It has been honed through use as the primary vehicle for image understanding research at SRI and dozens of other academic and industrial research laboratories throughout the world, as well as in more applied work such as the infrastructure for the RADIUS Testbed System <ref> [ Gerson and Wood, 1994 ] </ref> . A rough chronology of the system's evolution follows. 2.1 ImagCalc TM (1982-1984) ImagCalc is an image analysis system that provides flexible access to two-dimensional image processing tools, including displays at multiple resolutions, perspective projections, and a wide range of image operators.

Reference-contexts: TerrainCalc introduced the idea of the image perspective transformation and the fly-through, created by texture-mapping aerial imagery onto digital terrain models. 2.3 The Cartographic Modeling Environment TM (1986-1990) The Cartographic Modeling Environment <ref> [ Hanson et al., 1987, Hanson and Quam, 1988 ] </ref> , commonly referred to as CME, is an environment for deriving, editing, viewing, and rendering 3-D cartographic models. This system merged the capabilities of ImagCalc and TerrainCalc with additional interactive 3-D modeling facilities of its own.

Reference-contexts: The RCDE can also accommodate images generated by dynamic sensors, in which the image formation process involves movement of parts of the sensor or the entire sensor platform itself, such as the strip cameras used for aerial mapping or the imaging systems used in photo-reconnaissance satellites <ref> [ McDonald, 1995 ] </ref> . Full mathematical models of sensors of this type typically require two orders of magnitude more computation than for a central projection camera.

If accurate, georeferenced ground control (possibly augmented by image-to-image tie points) is available, absolute parameters are derived. If only image-to-image tie points are available, relative parameters are computed. The primary interface to this functionality is the Registration Tool.
