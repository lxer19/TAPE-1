Abstract: Inspired by a visual motion detection model for the rabbit retina and by a computational architecture used for early audition in the barn owl, we have designed a chip that employs a correlation model to report the one-dimensional field motion of a scene in real time. Using subthreshold analog VLSI techniques, we have fabricated and successfully tested a 8000 transistor chip using a standard MOSIS process.

Reference-contexts: The latter is a local computation that scales to different velocity ranges gracefully without suffering from the problems of extended interconnection. Inspired by visual motion detection models <ref> (Barlow and Levick, 1965) </ref> and by a computational architecture found in early audition (Konishi, 1986), we have designed a chip that contains a large array of velocity-tuned "cells" that correlate two events in time, using a delay-line structure.

Reference-contexts: An interesting feature of our model that also manifests itself in the visual system of the fly <ref> (Buchner 1984) </ref> is spatial aliasing, leading in the worst case to motion reversal. Spatial aliasing is due to the discrete sampling provided by photoreceptor spacing.

Reference-contexts: Many biological motion detection systems have been shown to use a cor-relation model <ref> (Grzywacz and Poggio, 1990) </ref>. To make use of this model, previous artificial systems, that typically look at sampled images of a scene changing in time, have had to cope with the correspondence problem, i.e. the problem of matching features between two images and measuring their shift in position.

Reference-contexts: The one-dimensional array of on-chip hysteretic photoreceptors (Delbruck and Mead, 1989) receives the light and reports rapid changes in the signal for both large and small changes.

By orienting the axons in alternating directions, as shown in Figure 1, any two adjacent receptors generates pulses that will "race" toward each other and meet at some point along the axon.
