Abstract: We investigate properties of reductions of S-terms. The combinator S has the reduction rule S x y z ! x z (y z). We prove that 1.) this rewriting system is top-terminating and 2.) admits no ground loops.

Reference-contexts: Example. The expression A A A has an infinite reduction. It had been found by H. Barendregt, see <ref> [Bar84] </ref>. Again the reduction can be described by a pattern, but it is not so obvious. Y 0 = S A (S A A) ; Y n+1 = A Y n First we show that the pattern is reached.

Reference-contexts: A cycle is a reduction X ! + X. A cycle can be composed with itself infinitely often, so the presence of cycles shows non-termination of the rewriting system. The following is known: 2.2. Proposition. CL (S) admits no cycles. Proof. (Due to J. Bergstra and J. W. Klop, <ref> [BK79] </ref>) The size of a S-term X is the number of S it contains. We denote this by jXj, where jSj = 1; jXY j = jXj + jY j.

Reference-contexts: Now K looks rather unsuspicious. One is lead to assume that the difficulty comes from S. That's the reason for studying the system CL (S). A first result in that direction is that having a normal form is decidable for S-terms. (conjectured in [Zac78], proved (independently) in <ref> [Wal97] </ref>). Still, the S rule is far from being completely understood, and even simple questions are difficult to answer, if at all. It is easy to see that there are no cycles in CL (S). It has been conjectured that there this system even admits no loops.

It has already been described by E. Zachos in <ref> [Zac78] </ref> X 0 X m = S T T X m ! T X m (T X m ) = X m+1 X m+1 The redexes are X 0 X 0 ; X 1 X 1 ; X 0 X 1 ; X 2 X 2 ; X 1 X 2
