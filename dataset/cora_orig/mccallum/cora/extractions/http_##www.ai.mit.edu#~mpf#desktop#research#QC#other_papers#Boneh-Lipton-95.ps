Abstract: Recently there has been a great deal of interest in the power of "Quantum Computers" [4, 15, 18]. The driving force is the recent beautiful result of Shor that shows that discrete log and factoring are solvable in random quantum polynomial time [15]. We use a method similar to Shor's to obtain a general theorem about quantum polynomial time. We show that any cryptosystem based on what we refer to as a `hidden linear form' can be broken in quantum polynomial time. Our results imply that the discrete log problem is doable in quantum polynomial time over any group including Galois fields and elliptic curves. Finally, we introduce the notion of `junk bits' which are helpful when performing classical computations that are not injective.

Reference-contexts: We hope that Fourier methods analogous to the ones used in this paper can be used to detect periods over S n . This will show that the graph isomorphism problem can be solved in random quantum polynomial time. We mention that Beals <ref> [1] </ref> has shown that the Fourier transform over the group S n can be carried out in quantum polynomial time. We have also introduced the concept of Junk bits which enables quantum machine to carry out certain non invertible functions in a way that does not effect the interference patterns.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the value of J (x) and f (x) should be almost independent of one another. Condition (1) implies that the map sending x to (f (x); J (x)) can be computed in QP using a result due to Bennett <ref> [2] </ref>. It should be clear that once we have computed (f (x); J (x)), the computation can proceed to use the value of f (x) as if J (x) was not written on the tape.

Reference-contexts: An immediate application of this result shows that the general discrete log problem for any finite group G can be solved in QP. Thus, QP can break any of the cryptosystems discussed above. Simon <ref> [14] </ref> observed that in QP it is possible to find a period of a function defined over Z n 2 . We show that it is possible to detect the period of any function defined over Z, even when the function is not one to one in its fundamental domain.

We begin by introducing some terminology. A function h : Z ! S has period q if for any integer x we have h (x + q) = h (x). <p> Indeed, as we shall see, in many important applications the value of q is not known. 3 Applications There are several applications of these theorems. First, we generalize the original results of Shor <ref> [15] </ref> to show how to compute discrete log over an arbitrary group. To achieve this we show how to phrase the general discrete log problem as a hidden linear form. Let h : Z ! G be a homomorphism and let fi = h (ff). <p> Theorem 2 can be used to find the period of h and hence the order of g. The ability to find the order of an element in Z fl q enables us to factor as is described in <ref> [15] </ref>. ut Another application of Theorem 1 concerns what are sometimes called "garbled" linear equations. Consider the following family of linear equations over Z q : . . . where e 1 ; : : : ; e m are unknown "errors" and the x's are known values. <p> It remains to prove that the set V satisfies the three properties specified in Section 5: 1. Given an observable (s; b) in V Condition (1) implies that we can find a non trivial factor z of q using a method similar to Shor's <ref> [15] </ref>. We can then define a new function h 0 (x) = h (zx) which will have period q=z. The algorithm can be applied recursively on h 0 to recover q=z. This shows that given a "good" observable we can find the period q. 2.
