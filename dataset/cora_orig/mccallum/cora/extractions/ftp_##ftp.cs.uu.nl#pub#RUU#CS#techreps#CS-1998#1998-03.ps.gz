Abstract: The increasing number of knowledge-based systems that build on a Bayesian belief network or influence diagram acknowledge the usefulness of these frameworks for addressing complex real-life problems. The usually large number of probabilities and utilities required for their application, however, is often considered a major obstacle. The use of qualitative abstractions may to some extent remove this obstacle. Qualitative belief networks and associated algorithms have been developed before. In this paper, we address qualitative influence diagrams and outline an efficient algorithm for qualitative decision making.

Reference-contexts: The belief-network and influence-diagram frameworks have demonstrated their practicability in a wide range of problem domains. Experience shows, however, that the usually large number of probabilities and utilities required poses a major obstacle to their application <ref> [Druzdzel and Van der Gaag 1995] </ref>. Motivated by this experience, the framework of qualitative belief networks was introduced in the early 1990s by M.P. Wellman (1990). 1 A qualitative belief network abstracts from numerical probabilities by encoding qualitative probabilistic relationships among its variables.

As the algorithm of Druzdzel and Henrion creates fewer ambiguities than Wellman's, our algorithm is able to solve more decision problems.

Reference-contexts: The framework of influence diagrams is tailored to decision making <ref> [Howard and Matheson 1981] </ref>.

A Bayesian belief network may be extended to an influence diagram to allow for decision making under uncertainty <ref> [Howard and Matheson 1981] </ref>. The formalism of influence diagrams provides for encoding not only a probability distribution on a set of variables, but also the decisions that a decision maker can take and the desirability of their uncertain consequences.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the late 1980s, the framework of Bayesian belief networks was introduced for reasoning with uncertainty <ref> [Pearl 1988] </ref>. The framework provides a formalism for encoding a joint probability distribution on a set of statistical variables and offers algorithms for probabilistic inference. In practice, reasoning with uncertainty is often performed to support a decision maker in solving complex real-life problems. <p> In Section 5 we give some conclusions and directions for further research. 2 Belief networks and influence diagrams The framework of Bayesian belief networks for reasoning with uncertainty is rooted in probability theory <ref> [Pearl 1988] </ref>. It offers a formalism for encoding a joint probability distribution on a set of statistical variables, in which information about independences is explicitly separated from numerical quantities. A belief network consists of a qualitative part and an associated quantitative part. <p> Note that the presence of any of these causes suffices to considerably increase the probability of a severe sore throat in a child. fl A belief network uniquely represents a probability distribution. It thus provides for computing any probability of interest. To this end efficient algorithms are available <ref> [Pearl 1988, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter 1988] </ref>. A Bayesian belief network may be extended to an influence diagram to allow for decision making under uncertainty [Howard and Matheson 1981].

Reference-contexts: If the influence of A on B is not monotonic, we say that it is ambiguous, denoted S ? (A; B). The set of influences of a qualitative belief network exhibits various convenient properties <ref> [Wellman 1990, Renooij 1996] </ref>. The property of symmetry guarantees that, if the network includes the influence S + (A; B), then it also includes S + (B; A).

Reference-contexts: For reasoning with a qualitative belief network, an elegant algorithm is available from M.J. Druzdzel and M. Henrion (1993). As belief networks may be extended to influence diagrams, qualitative belief networks may be enhanced to qualitative influence diagrams <ref> [Wellman 1990] </ref>. A qualitative influence diagram abstracts from the numerical quantities involved in a decision problem under study by encoding qualitative probabilistic and preferential relationships among its variables. Since their introduction, research has focused mainly on qualitative belief networks, with less attention for qualitative influence diagrams. <p> The preferred sequence of decisions is a sequence with highest expected utility. Efficient algorithms are available for decision making with influence diagrams [Shachter 1986]. 3 Qualitative belief networks Qualitative belief networks, introduced by M.P. Wellman as qualitative abstractions of belief networks, bear a strong resemblance to their quantitative counterparts <ref> [Wellman 1990] </ref>. A qualitative belief network comprises a graphical representation of the independences among a set of statistical variables, once more taking the form of an acyclic digraph. Instead of conditional probabilities, however, a qualitative belief network associates with its digraph qualitative probabilistic relationships. <p> If the influence of A on B is not monotonic, we say that it is ambiguous, denoted S ? (A; B). The set of influences of a qualitative belief network exhibits various convenient properties <ref> [Wellman 1990, Renooij 1996] </ref>. The property of symmetry guarantees that, if the network includes the influence S + (A; B), then it also includes S + (B; A). <p> In addition to influences, a qualitative belief network includes synergies modeling interactions among influences. An additive synergy between three nodes expresses how the values of two nodes jointly influence the probabilities of the values of the third node <ref> [Wellman 1990] </ref>. <p> To conclude, T and E exhibit a positive additive synergy on utility. The resulting qualitative influence diagram is shown in Figure 4. fl For decision making with qualitative influence diagrams, M.P. Wellman has designed an algorithm based on the idea of recursively reducing a diagram <ref> [Wellman 1990] </ref>. Unfortu nately, this algorithm tends to create more ambiguities than necessary and, hence, is able to 7 R T , V + compute a preferred decision for fewer problems than possible [Druzdzel and Henrion 1993].
