Title: A Central Axis Algorithm for 3D Bronchial Tree Structures  
Author: Chandrasekhar Pisupati Lawrence Wolff Wayne Mitzner Elias Zerhouni 
Abstract: We designed a two pass algorithm to compute the central axis tree of bronchial tree structures. In the first pass, the topological branching tree structure T is obtained by using a top-down region growing algorithm on the tree volume. In the second pass, T is used to region grow bottom-up from the leaves, in order to obtain accurate centroid points that lie along the axes of the branches. Using these centroid points at each bifurcation, the branch point and the three direction vectors along the branches are computed, by solving a non-linear optimization problem. By connecting the computed branch points at each bifurcation with straight lines, we obtain the central axis tree on which we make the measurements. We also ran our algorithm on 3D tree models (cylindrical branches) that simulate bronchial trees and the computed central axis compared favorably with the ground truth central axis in terms of the measured physiological parameters.

Reference-contexts: This results in a cleaner, more proper central axis for the bronchial trees. Since there are no standard tools to measure the performance of our algorithm or verify its correctness, except, through subjective assessments, we decided to run our algorithm on 3D tree models that simulate bronchial trees <ref> [7] </ref>.

The 3D stick model is input to the model generator <ref> [7] </ref>. The input is in the form of a binary tree (ground truth central axis) with each segment of the stick model containing the 3D coordinates of the endpoints, and the radius of that branch segment.
