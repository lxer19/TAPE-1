Abstract: This paper presents an alternative approach to the segmentation of a page of unconstrained handwritten cursive script into lines and the estimation of the zoning information of handwriting. Approximating spline functions are used to describe complete lines of writing, iteratively providing more precise information about the location of the zones. The method is capable of dealing with various distortions at page and line level including rotated or overlapping lines of script, curved baselines, changing height of the middle zone and ascenders and descenders of varying length (ref. Fig. 1 for a typical example). Tests performed on 50 pages of handwriting have shown this approach to be superior to alternative methods.

Reference-contexts: A horizontal projection method is used in [4] and [5] , others project local maxima found in the writing or combine both methods [3] .

Lines of real and unconstrained handwriting, however, are not necessarily straight or horizontal. The width of the zones may vary within a line of writing and even within single words.

Reference-contexts: The top, half-, base and bottom-line (the zone-lines, Fig. 1) separate the zones, the centre-line describes the centre of the middle zone.

Reference-contexts: Lines of real and unconstrained handwriting, however, are not necessarily straight or horizontal. The width of the zones may vary within a line of writing and even within single words. This can be represented with a set of approximating spline-functions <ref> [6] </ref> (from here on referred to as splines ) approximating significant points according to their importance while optimising the smoothness of the curve. As the resulting spline function tends to oscillate for varying horizontal distances, the original points are resampled before approximation.
