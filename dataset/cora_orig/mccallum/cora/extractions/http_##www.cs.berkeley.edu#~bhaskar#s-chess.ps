Abstract: Chess is one of the most ancient games known. Suicide-Chess is a variation of chess in which the objective of the game is to lose all of one's pieces rather than capture the opponent's King. In order that this makes sense, captures are not optional but forced moves. Chess programs have barely been able to achieve Grand-Master level of play. The reason for this is the huge exponential growth of the game's search tree. However, in suicide-chess, the growth factor is much smaller than in chess due to the fact that there are forced moves on several occasions. This has motivated us to attempt at coming up with a good suicide-chess playing program. In this work, we present a survey of different strategies in chess programs. We do this in the light of their relevance to the problem at hand. This leads us to propose several features that can be incorporated in a suicide-chess program. We have implemented a program having many of the proposed features.

Reference-contexts: Unlike in standard chess, there are a few known positions relatively early in the game that to even an experienced player seem good, but turn out to be a forced win for the other side <ref> [Bra] </ref> (discovered through brute-force search outside of play). By storing a table of recognized positions, the engine can quickly recognize if it a given position is a forced win/loss, and incorporate this into its evaluation function. There are several known end-games in suicide-chess [WWWa].

Reference-contexts: Material Scoring In normal chess, a side is given points for each piece it has on the square. Typical scores are (the ratio) Q = 9; R = 5; B = 3; N = 3; P = 1; K = 200 ([New75a], [New75b], [New75c], <ref> [Fre78a] </ref>). For suicide-chess, we could simply use negative values with the King having no special status (K = 1). The negative points simply mean that pieces are a liability in suicide-chess. <p> Mobility The more the number of squares controlled by one's pieces, the better it is in normal chess. Hence points are given for every square controlled by any piece of a side ([New75a], [New75b], [Lev76a], <ref> [Fre78a] </ref>). In suicide chess, it's good if very less number of squares are covered. Hence a penalty should be associated with each square controlled. Chess programs give additional weight to control squares in the center & those near the opponent's King. <p> This is because, if a piece is protected at a position & the opponent captures it, one would be forced to capture the opponent's piece immediately. Pawn Structure In normal chess, a penalty is associated with doubled pawns, backward pawns & isolated pawns ([New75a], [New75b], [New75c], <ref> [Fre78a] </ref>). Isolated pawns & backward pawns are neither a disadvantage nor an advantage (at least more experience is needed to tell either way). However, for the same reason as why any pawn is a liability, doubled pawns are more of a liability. They are more difficult to get rid of. <p> Hence an additional penalty is appropriate for doubled pawns in suicide-chess. Other factors Chess programs consider several other factors in the EF. These fall into categories. The first category consists of factors like checks & mates, king-safety, king-mobility etc ( [New75b], [New75c], <ref> [Fre78a] </ref>) which are clearly not 6 necessary for suicide-chess. The second category includes factors like pawn promotion, piece development, castling etc ([Fre78a], [New75c], [New75b]) which may be considered. <p> The reason is that the horizon effect is far more severe in suicide-chess. An unexamined move could have been good since it would have resulted in a series of forced moves for the opponent starting at the 4th ply. In fact, the North-Western chess program <ref> [Fre78a] </ref> avoids forward pruning altogether for the same reason. Ordering moves The moves to be considered at a node are ordered according to a plausibility score that is aimed to result in maximum fffi pruning ([New75c], [Fre78a]). <p> In fact, the North-Western chess program <ref> [Fre78a] </ref> avoids forward pruning altogether for the same reason. Ordering moves The moves to be considered at a node are ordered according to a plausibility score that is aimed to result in maximum fffi pruning ([New75c], [Fre78a]). The plausibility score considers several factors (such as castling, captures, pawn-advance etc) in chess. For suicide-chess, we could simply consider moves that force the next move on the opponent ahead of the other moves.

Reference-contexts: We believe that such techniques are required for suicide-chess also. But more experience is needed to formulate such rules for suicide-chess. Middle-game This is the stage that is most appropriate for a tree-search algorithm. End-Game The end-game is very difficult to play using a tree-search <ref> [Fre78b] </ref>. The horizon-effect is severe & pattern recognition (which computers are bad at & our neural-net brain is good at) plays an important role. A deep-ply search is required. For this, pruning should be very effective which can result from a good ordering function (plausibility score).

Reference-contexts: Hence they should be given as much penalty as a Bishop, Knight or a Rook. Mobility The more the number of squares controlled by one's pieces, the better it is in normal chess. Hence points are given for every square controlled by any piece of a side ([New75a], [New75b], <ref> [Lev76a] </ref>, [Fre78a]).

Reference-contexts: Relative Importance of the Factors Given that there are multiple factors to consider for the EF, it makes sense to talk about their relative importance. In normal chess, material is given the maximum weightage ([New75b], <ref> [Lev76b] </ref>). However, since material advantage does not always decide which move is good, we need other factors to play an important role. Most chess programs give the other factors a weight comparable to the material factor. However, in suicide-chess, material should be given the maximum weight.

Reference-contexts: Forward Pruning Several chess programs choose a subset of the moves possible at a given position & explore only these moves ([Lev76a], [New75c]). Some programs consider a large number of moves at lower depths & lesser number of moves at larger depths ([New75c], <ref> [Lev76c] </ref>). A bunch of factors are considered in deciding the subset of moves to be considered. 7 We argue that such forward pruning can be dangerous in suicide-chess. The reason is that the horizon effect is far more severe in suicide-chess.

Reference-contexts: For suicide-chess, we could simply consider moves that force the next move on the opponent ahead of the other moves. Secondary search In order to avoid the horizon-effect, a secondary search is made at the leaf of a principal continuation of the mini-max search <ref> [Lev76d] </ref>. If the backed-up score from the secondary search results in a worse score for the side to move, the new score is considered instead of the score from the EF. Since the horizon-effect is severe in suicide-chess, a secondary search is very important.

Reference-contexts: Other strategies A few other strategies that are commonly used in chess programs are as follows. * Remembering old moves: In chess, a good move usually remains good for a while. Good moves are remembered from the previous search to guide the new search <ref> [Lev76e] </ref>. We expect that this wont be a significant gain in suicide-chess since the game passes through active phases very often.

Reference-contexts: Material Scoring In normal chess, a side is given points for each piece it has on the square. Typical scores are (the ratio) Q = 9; R = 5; B = 3; N = 3; P = 1; K = 200 ([New75a], <ref> [New75b] </ref>, [New75c], [Fre78a]).

In suicide chess, it's good if very less number of squares are covered. Hence a penalty should be associated with each square controlled. Chess programs give additional weight to control squares in the center & those near the opponent's King. <p> While the consideration of the second factor is clearly not necessary in suicide-chess, whether or not control of center squares is worse than controlling other squares is debatable. We think that this is rather unimportant anyway. Piece Safety Chess programs consider protecting a piece as a desirable feature <ref> [New75b] </ref>. It should be the opposite for suicide-chess. This is because, if a piece is protected at a position & the opponent captures it, one would be forced to capture the opponent's piece immediately. <p> This is because, if a piece is protected at a position & the opponent captures it, one would be forced to capture the opponent's piece immediately.

We discuss tree-traversal strategies next. Variable depth searching It makes sense to consider only promising moves for a deeper search ([New75a], <ref> [New75b] </ref>). For example, Turing [New75b] suggested that only considerable moves be examined at greater depths. He defined considerable moves as (a) recapturing moves (b) capture of undefended piece (c) capture of pieces of higher value by pieces of lower value & (d) moves giving check-mate. <p> Apart from the generic ff fi algorithm, chess programs have to use other strategies to do effective pruning.

For the same reason as above, this may not be appropriate or important for suicide-chess. What is a good move & what is a bad move may change definition very rapidly in suicide-chess. 3.4 Overall game play A chess game is divided into opening, middle-game & end-game.

Reference-contexts: It is difficult to come up with a good generic plausibility score function for chess. However, we feel that the simple rule of thumb of considering forcing moves ahead of others should be good for suicide-chess. We plan to test this claim by playing known end-games <ref> [WWWa] </ref> in suicide-chess using our program. 4 Implementation We have implemented a suicide-chess program incorporating some of the ideas discussed above. This section describes our implementation briefly & discusses its behavior. <p> By storing a table of recognized positions, the engine can quickly recognize if it a given position is a forced win/loss, and incorporate this into its evaluation function. There are several known end-games in suicide-chess <ref> [WWWa] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Chess is one of the most ancient games known. The game in its richness has several variations that can be defined <ref> [WWWb] </ref>. A relatively recent & increasingly popular variation of chess is the game of Suicide-Chess 1 . Here the objective of the game is to lose all of one's pieces rather than capture the opponent's King. In order that this makes sense, captures are forced moves.

Reference-contexts: We also present our experience (in the limited opportunity that we had) with it. 1.1 Problem Definition In suicide-chess, the objective is to lose one's pieces rather than capture the opponent's pieces. The significant differences from normal chess rules are as follows <ref> [WWWc] </ref>. * When a player has a capturing move, (s)he has to make that move. <p> There is no notion of check or check-mate. * Pawn can promote to a King. All pieces move & capture just as in normal chess. Pawn promotions can still be made. 1.1.1 Variations Some of the subtler rules of suicide-chess are not universally agreed upon <ref> [WWWc] </ref>.
