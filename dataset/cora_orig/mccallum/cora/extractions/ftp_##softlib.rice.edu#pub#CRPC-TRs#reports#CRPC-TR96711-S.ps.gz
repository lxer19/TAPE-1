Reference-contexts: These viscous-inviscid-interaction (VII) codes have the main advantage of providing accurate results for certain aerodynamic problems in less computational time than the high-fidelity Navier-Stokes methods <ref> [2] </ref>, [3]. The primary disadvantage of VII codes is that they cannot model conditions with extensive flow separation. However, since on-design conditions usually include the reduction or elimination of flow separation, VII codes are especially useful in analyses near the final airfoil design. <p> The turbulence model utilized by the boundary layer code is the same described in reference [22] and applied in references <ref> [2] </ref> and [9]. <p> The match is satisfactory, and the small scatter near the trailing edge of the airfoil when using 10 coefficients to approximate the transpiration velocity function has also been observed in reference <ref> [2] </ref>. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the displacement action of the boundary layer [23]. Figure 5 illustrates the Mach isolines about the airfoil obtained from the original code (left) and the enhanced code when using 18 coefficients (right). This match is also satisfactory. <p> In Fig. 7, the surface pressure coefficient distribution obtained from the enhanced code are compared to experimental values and those obtained from the original code (left) for Case 3. The match is satisfactory with the exception of the prediction on shock wave location. Figure 7 (right) presents results <ref> [2] </ref> taken at an angle of attack (ff num = 2:92) slightly different from Case 3. The results of reference [2] are included to illustrate that in general, VII codes tend to underpredict the location of the shock wave while Navier-Stokes solvers tend to overpredict its location. 5 Conclusions An existing <p> The match is satisfactory with the exception of the prediction on shock wave location.

Reference-contexts: The transpiration velocity is an inviscid normal-velocity boundary condition which is imposed at the body surface to simulate the displacement of the inviscid flow by the viscous flow momentum defect <ref> [12] </ref>. Specifically, the transpiration velocity is a scalar quantity that is considered positive if injecting fluid into the airfoil flow or negative if removing fluid.

Reference-contexts: An expression for the transpiration velocity can be obtained by integrating the difference between the inviscid and viscous continuity equations across the boundary layer while applying the Prandtl boundary-layer and uniform inviscid-flow assumptions <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The variable ! is the relaxation parameter, and the superscripts indicate k-th and (k 1)-th VII global iteration z , respectively. Relaxation <ref> [17] </ref> is necessary, since in our case the direct use of the calculated transpiration velocity is a source of numerical instability that can prevent the convergence of the VII code.

Reference-contexts: The obvious aim is there-fore to minimize the difference between the transpiration velocity of two consecutive VII global iterations, and to avoid relaxation. 3.1 Parallel Direct Search PDS (Parallel Direct Search) is an algorithm for the solution of nonlinear optimization problems using direct search methods <ref> [18] </ref>. Direct search methods have the advantage of using only information from the C 0 -continuous objective function and not requiring derivative calculations. <p> The complexity of the transpiration velocity, which depends on a number of dependent and independent variables, encourages the use of PDS as a derivative-free optimization method. Furthermore, and most importantly, the required function evaluations are calculated in parallel with an almost linear speed-up <ref> [18] </ref>, which means that the decrease of execution time is linearly proportional to the number of processors added. The numerical tests presented in this paper were executed on the Rice-CRPC-IBM/SP2, where PDS is executed in parallel by means of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) environment [19]. <p> The nonzero transpiration distribution vector obtained is relaxed with a coefficient of ! = 0:1, and this relaxed transpiration vector forms the initial guess for the optimization problem to be solved by PDS. The PDS then creates a number of perturbed transpiration vectors <ref> [18] </ref>, which in turn form the Euler code boundary conditions. The black-box code is executed for all of the resulting transpiration distribution vectors. The objective function is then evaluated, i.e. the difference between every input 5 transpiration vector and its corresponding output vector.

Reference-contexts: The numerical tests presented in this paper were executed on the Rice-CRPC-IBM/SP2, where PDS is executed in parallel by means of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) environment <ref> [19] </ref>. The strategy of applying PDS to the coupling mechanism is as follows: as with the original VII code, a zero transpiration vector is assumed in the first execution of the Euler and the boundary layer codes.
