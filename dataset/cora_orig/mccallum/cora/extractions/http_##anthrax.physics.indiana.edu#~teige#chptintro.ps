Reference-contexts: A specific example follows. Intemann and Greenhut <ref> [1] </ref> (with a slight gen eralization) give for the effective mass distribution dN = A (1 + ffy) 2 u 0 M 2 M 2 where E 0 = a + M 2 (4) (M b + 2M )(E 0 M b ) (5) and with ff a parameter to be <p> A model, due to Intemann and Greenhut <ref> [1] </ref> , may shed some light on this seemingly mysterious result. These authors describe 0 decays in terms of virtual two body decays. <p> The decays considered in eqn. 13 are 0 ! ffi + 6 0 ! Intemann and Greenhut <ref> [1] </ref> refer to this as a "scalar meson dominance" model. The matrix element of eqn. 13 is written in rather old language, I now interpret the terms in it in more current usage.

Reference-contexts: The fits are as described previously. 1 These fits from older references used a form different than eqn. 3, that is, (1 + 2ffy) for the correction. There is an experiment with 220k events (J. G. Layter et al. <ref> [2] </ref> ) but the ff parameter was fixed and other parameters determined. The result quoted here is my average of two lower statistics experiments. (C. Baglin et al. [3] and A. Larribe et al.. [4] ) 2 From the review article by Kalbfleisch [5, 6] .

Reference-contexts: It is useful to examine the effective mass distributions with the phase space dependence factored out. Figure 4.1 shows these distributions along with a prediction from a phase shift analysis. 3 Should be identically zero 4 Alde et al. <ref> [7] </ref> 5 ! + 0 divided by The expectation from pure phase space. The dots are a prediction from a phase shift analysis.
