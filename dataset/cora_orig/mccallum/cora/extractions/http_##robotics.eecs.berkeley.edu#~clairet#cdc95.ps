Abstract: A dynamic model for the longitudinal axis of a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) aircraft is presented. Non-minimum phase characteristics in this model result from the fact that the process of generating an upward pitch moment produces a small downward force, causing the aircraft to lose altitude. The model is not full state linearizable and the internal dynamics which remain after input-output linearization using the coordinates of the center of mass as outputs are unstable. The CTOL model is not flat with respect to fixed points on the aircraft body. The nonlinear inversion technique [1] produces stable trajectories for the states of the internal dynamics, but the corresponding feed-forward force inputs required to track these trajectories are large. Approximate linearization techniques ([2], [3]) which ignore the coupling between the pitch moment and the vertical and horizontal aircraft dynamics, may be used to calculate inputs of smaller magnitude.

Reference-contexts: The discussion in Section 3 will indicate that the CTOL problem is much harder, however. Flat outputs may exist, but determining them from the equations of the model is difficult. Yet another approach was proposed by Devasia and Paden in <ref> [1] </ref>. The main feature of their technique is that it allows for non-causal inputs. In Section 4 we investigate the application of this technique to our example. We conclude that it leads to well behaved internal dynamics, but its implementation requires large feed-forward inputs. <p> In equation (5) above, R (ff) and R () are rotation matrices of the form R () = cos () sin () # and the vector <ref> [0; 1] </ref> T accounts for the gravitational force. <p> forces on the angle of attack, it is likely that the flat outputs, if they exist, will have to depend on both and ff, and thereby on _x and _y. 4 Exact Tracking using Stable Nonlinear Inversion Another approach to exact tracking is Devasia and Paden's inversion-based output tracking method <ref> [1] </ref>. This section describes the application of this method to the CTOL aircraft described in equations (5) and (6). A brief outline of the method is presented, and a solution to the internal dynamics of equation (8) is obtained. <p> (19) The solution is obtained by transforming the internal dynamics into a perturbed linear system, _ (t) = A (t)(t) + (s (; Y d ; t) A (t)(t)); (20) and then solving equation (20) iteratively, as, 1 (t) = 0 (21) where A is a linear operator, derived in <ref> [1] </ref>, which maps bounded desired trajectories Y d to bounded solutions of equation (18). <p> Following the algorithm of <ref> [1] </ref>, the linearized system is decoupled into stable and unstable subsystems, W s (t) and W u (t), using a decoupling transformation S A (t).

Reference-contexts: In Section 4 we investigate the application of this technique to our example. We conclude that it leads to well behaved internal dynamics, but its implementation requires large feed-forward inputs. To avoid generating large feed-forward inputs, approximate tracking techniques have been proposed in the literature <ref> [2, 3, 9] </ref>. Typically they involve neglecting small parasitic couplings between the mechanisms of force and moment generation. The price to pay for the moderate inputs is inexact tracking, caused by the neglected terms. Typically, the performance of the approximate laws gets better as the coupling gets weaker. <p> Through the use of such outputs and their time derivatives, the state trajectory of the system can be completely determined. In [8], "flat" outputs are shown to exist for a planar model of a VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft, taken from <ref> [2] </ref>. The outputs which make the system flat are the coordinates of a fixed point on the aircraft body, * close to the center of mass, where * is the magnitude of a parasitic coupling term similar to the one in the CTOL model. <p> The former technique is easy to implement, but results in only approximate tracking (* close) of trajectories specified in terms of the center of mass. This technique has an advantage over the more conventional techniques for approximate tracking <ref> [2] </ref> in that only the tracking error and not the 6 stability of the scheme relies on the magnitude of the coupling. The latter method produces exact tracking of these trajectories, but at the cost of a severe increase in the complexity of the calculations. <p> In this section, we briefly describe how the approximate linearization techniques of <ref> [2] </ref> and [3] may be applied to this system to try to produce inputs with smaller magnitudes. <p> In the approximate linearization technique of <ref> [2] </ref>, * is set to zero so that the coupling between the input u 2 and the vertical acceleration is neglected, so we define: " y = R () R T (ff) D # " 0 + 0 # = u 2 : (40) We may perform dynamic extension by defining

Reference-contexts: A number of methods have been proposed in the literature for output tracking of non-minimum phase systems. The work of <ref> [5] </ref> assumes that the trajectories are generated by a Poisson stable exo-system, which implies that the class of trajectories that can be tracked is rather restricted. The trajectories that we are considering are generated by the ATMS and cannot be directly related to a stable exo-system.

Reference-contexts: In addition, this technique requires solving a partial differential equation which may be impossible to do in closed form.
