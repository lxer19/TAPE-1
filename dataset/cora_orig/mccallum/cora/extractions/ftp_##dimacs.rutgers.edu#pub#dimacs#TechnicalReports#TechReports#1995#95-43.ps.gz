Reference-contexts: More specifically, concatenation of small ESMTs (with up to 4 terminals) proved to yield good quality solutions for the obstacle-free case <ref> [9, 1] </ref>. Similar approach seems to be applicable when the terminals are inside a simple polygon or amidst polygonal obstacles. The reader interested in a more thorough discussion on issues associated with the concatenation of small ESMTs is referred to [11]. <p> A line through two points p and q is denoted by L (p; q). Lemma 1 Every c-kite P , c 3, has exactly c 2 interior tangents for any fixed slope r 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. Proof. Every triangulation of a simple polygon has n2 triangles. Each triangle contributes to the total sum of interior angles by . The sum of interior angles of any simple polygon with n vertices is therefore (n 2).

Reference-contexts: In that paper we also proved that the ESMT for 3 terminals in a simple polygon can be determined in O (n) time and space. The reader is referred to <ref> [5] </ref> for basic definitions and properties of ESMTs. The paper is organized as follows. Basic definitions are given in Section 2. The original problem is reduced in Section 3 to the ESTP for up to four semi-terminals in a smaller polygon of a very particular shape.

Reference-contexts: Again, O (n) time and space is needed. P 2 is a weakly-simple polygon (Fig. 2). Note that P 2 can be obtained directly from P . However, a triangulation of P is needed anyway in order to determine shortest paths between terminals in O (n) time. Provan <ref> [8] </ref> proved that there always exists an obstacle-avoiding ESMT for T completely in P 2 . If i (P 2 ) = ;, then the ESMT for T in P 2 is trivially given. We assume therefore in the following that i (P 2 ) 6= ;.

Reference-contexts: Such a heuristic would be based on the concatenation of small ESMT. Determination of ESMTs for small subsets of terminals in presence of several (convex) obstacles is also of interest. In this context, Steiner visibility graph introduced in <ref> [10] </ref> could prove useful. Finally, we mention the problem of preprocessing a simple polygon so that three and/or four terminals queries for ESMTs can be answered efficiently.

The reader interested in a more thorough discussion on issues associated with the concatenation of small ESMTs is referred to <ref> [11] </ref>. In that paper we also proved that the ESMT for 3 terminals in a simple polygon can be determined in O (n) time and space. The reader is referred to [5] for basic definitions and properties of ESMTs. The paper is organized as follows. <p> Remove from it (one at a time) outermost triangles (sharing only one side) if the remaining triangles contain all terminals. Let P 1 denote the polygon determined by the boundary of the exterior face of the reduced triangulation. It was shown in <ref> [11] </ref> that the ESMT for T in P is completely in P 1 . Let P 2 denote the polygon inside P 1 with the minimum length perimeter and containing the set of terminals T . <p> In order to determine P 2 , let P u 2 denote the minimum length perimeter polygon for T u = T ft u g, u = i; j; k; l, inside P 1 . It was shown in <ref> [11] </ref> how to determine P u 2 in O (n) time and space. <p> Assume that q l is such a semi-terminal. Hence, q l = t l , and Q l = Q fq l g is the set of convex vertices of P 3 (Fig. 3). It was shown in <ref> [11] </ref> how to determine d i (v); d j (v); d k (v) for all vertices v of P 3 in O (n) time and space. <p> Let d i (v), d j (v), d k (v) denote shortest distances between a vertex v on P l 3 and semi-terminals q i ; q j ; q k , respectively. It was argued in <ref> [11] </ref> that these distances can be determined in linear time and space for all vertices. We next show how to determine obstacle-avoiding full Steiner trees for q j ; q k and v for all reflex vertices v on P 3 (q i ; q j ). <p> Let z jk (v) denote the length of the shortest such trees. Initially, z jk (v) = 1. Circular sweep described in <ref> [11] </ref> requires linear time and space to determine all full Steiner trees for triples of vertices of the 3-kite P l 3 . For each triple v i , v j and v k admitting a full Steiner tree, let w denote its length.
