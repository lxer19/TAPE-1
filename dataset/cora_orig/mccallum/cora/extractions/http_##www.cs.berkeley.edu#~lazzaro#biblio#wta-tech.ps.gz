Reference-contexts: This circuit has been used successfully as a component in several VLSI sensory systems, that perform auditory localization (Lazzaro and Mead, in press) and visual stereopsis <ref> (Mahowald and Delbruck, 1988) </ref>. Winner-take-all circuits with over 170 inputs function correctly in these sensory systems. We have also modified this global winner-take-all circuit, realizing a circuit that computes local nonlinear inhibition.
