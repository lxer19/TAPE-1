Reference-contexts: Finally, because bases are computed from single points, our method does not suffer from the combinatorial explosion present in basis geometric hashing as the amount of data is increased. 4 The iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm developed concurrently by Besl & McKay <ref> [1] </ref> and Zhang [20] has been shown to be an excellent method for registration of free form surfaces [16]. <p> We have developed a method of verification that is a variation of the iterative closest point algorithm. Not only does this method verify possible matches, but it also improves the transformation between scene and model. The iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm concurrently proposed by Besl & McKay <ref> [1] </ref> and Zhang [20] is an excellent method for the registration of free form curves and surfaces when the transformation between model and scene is small.

Reference-contexts: They establish correspondence between two curves using an indexing scheme that stores all curve points in a lookup table. Their method requires the extraction of 3-D curves (features) from volume data and then the calculation of sensitive Frenet frames on the curves. Chua and Jarvis <ref> [2] </ref> present a method that is similar to ours for recognition of free-form objects using point correspondences. However, their method establishes correspondences by comparing principal curvatures of points, and therefore requires the calculation of sensitive Darboux frames at every point on the object. <p> An obvious choice for these axes would be the directions of principal curvature on the surface <ref> [2] </ref>, which would result in the construction of the Darboux frame at the point. However, determination of the directions of principal curvature of a surface require the computation of second-order surface derivatives, so the resulting axes are very susceptible to noise.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the distribution of correlation coefficients is not normal. However, if R is transformed into a different variable V a normal distribution N (V,s V ) with mean and variance results <ref> [3] </ref>. If all of the comparisons of spin-images had the same number of samples, an appropriate way to pick the best comparison would be to chose the comparison i that satisfies where E [x] is the expectation of x.

Reference-contexts: Except at discontinuities, the surface normal is a well defined axis for a point on the surface of an object because it can be computed without calculating second-order surface derivatives (it is determined as the eigenvector with smallest eigenvalue of the inertia matrix of the surrounding points <ref> [4] </ref>). If one were to attempt to create an Euclidean three-dimensional basis at a point on the surface of an object using the surface normal as one of the axes, two axes in the plane tangent to the point would have to be determined.

Reference-contexts: Structural indexing is an excellent way to establish correspondences between arbitrarily shaped objects because it makes no assumptions about the shape of objects. Possibly the work most relevant to our work in establishing correspondences is that of Guziec and Ayache <ref> [8] </ref> for the matching of 3-D curves. They establish correspondence between two curves using an indexing scheme that stores all curve points in a lookup table. Their method requires the extraction of 3-D curves (features) from volume data and then the calculation of sensitive Frenet frames on the curves. <p> femur occludes the pelvis and the significant portions of the model are missing. view 1 view 2 oblique shaded oblique points top points view 3 Range Views Registration 28 A popular result in the biomedical imaging literature is the registration of two skull data sets generated from volumetric medical scanners <ref> [8] </ref>. Figure 17 shows the registration of two different surface meshes of a skull created from the same CT data set. The surface meshes were created by adding small amounts of Gaussian noise to the points in the original surface mesh generated from the CT scans and then decimating.

Reference-contexts: the topology or shape of the objects represented, our algorithm can recognize arbitrarily shaped objects; and, since no initial transformation is required, our algorithm can be used for object recognition in completely unknown environments. 1.1 Related Work A comprehensive overview of model representation in 3-D object recognition is given in <ref> [9] </ref> and comprehensive overviews of methods for establishing correspondences and verifying matches are given in [6][7]. Because of their direct relevance to our algorithm, some review of work in the areas of geometric hashing, structural indexing and the iterative closest point algorithms is necessary.

Reference-contexts: Geo 3 metric hashing can be broken into two categories: basis geometric hashing and structural indexing or curve based geometric hashing <ref> [10] </ref>. In basis geometric hashing, local features are extracted from the model of an object and basis coordinate systems are generated using tuples of these features.

The same procedure is applied to the scene range image; then the duck model is recognized in the scene using the OPI and ICPV algorithms.

Reference-contexts: We have chosen bilinear interpolation of the spin-map coordinates of the points because it is a simple way to reduce the effects of possible noise in the data. The work of Rigoutsos and Hummel <ref> [15] </ref> has shown that the statistically optimal method for distributing the contribution of a point in a hash table for 2-D affine point matching is through gaussian weighting of nearby bins based on some expected error in the position of the point.

The obstacle to using ICP for object recognition is that it requires an initial estimate of the transformation between model and scene because it is a greedy algorithm that converges to the nearest local minimum in transformation space.

Reference-contexts: Structural indexing or curve geometric hashing does not use tuples of features like basis geometric hashing, but computes local signatures on objects that are stored in a look up table. Usually these signatures are curves that are processed in some way for easy comparison <ref> [17] </ref>. In the preprocessing stage, signatures are computed for each model and stored; at recognition time signatures are computed in the scene and compared to the model signatures to establish correspondences. <p> It seemed that instead of a hash table, a representation more along the lines of those used in structural indexing would be more efficient and appropriate <ref> [17] </ref>. From our work using a hash table it became apparent that an efficient way of storing and comparing the points of a spin-image is by representing them with a discrete 2-D array instead of as sets of 2-D points.
