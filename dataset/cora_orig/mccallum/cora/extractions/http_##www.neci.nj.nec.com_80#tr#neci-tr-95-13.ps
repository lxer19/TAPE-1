Abstract: We describe a local parallel method for computing the stochastic completion field introduced in an earlier paper (Williams and Jacobs '95). The stochastic completion field represents the likelihood that a completion joining two contour fragments passes through any given position and orientation in the image plane. It is based upon the assumption that the prior probability distribution of completion shape can be modelled as a random walk in a lattice of discrete positions and orientations. The local parallel method can be interpreted as a stable finite difference scheme for solving the underlying Fokker-Planck equation identified by Mumford (Mumford '94). The resulting algorithm is significantly faster than the previously employed method which relied on convolution with large kernel filters computed by Monte Carlo simulation. The complexity of the new method is O(n 3 m) while that of the previous algorithm was O(n 4 m 2 ) (for an n fi n image with m discrete orientations). Perhaps most significantly, the use of a local method allows us to model the probability distribution of completion shape using stochastic processes which are neither homogenous nor isotropic. For example, it is possible to modulate particle decay rate by a directional function of local image brightnesses (i.e., anisotropic decay). The effect is that illusory contours can be made to respect the local image brightness structure. Finally, we note that the new method is more plausible as a neural model since 1) unlike the previous method, it can be computed in a sparse, locally connected network; and 2) the network dynamics are consistent with psychophysical measurements of the time course of illusory contour formation.

See Feller <ref> [5] </ref>, for example, for more detail on this. Similar reasoning tells us that the distribution of a particle's position in the y direction will have mean P t i=1 s i and variance P t P t i ) which can also range from 0 to t 4 .

Reference-contexts: The completion field first appears in frame (j), at the 18 point midway between both sources. In frames (k-t) the completion field rapidly spreads outward in both directions away from the midpoint and back toward the two sources. The third demonstration is the well known Kanizsa triangle <ref> [13] </ref> (see Figure 5 (a)). Detecting and localizing points where it is likely that one surface occludes another (i.e., "T" or "L" junctions) and then measuring the orientations of both boundary contours in the neighborhood of that point is a difficult and unsolved problem.

Reference-contexts: This figure also illustrates the strong connection between the stochastic completion field and the active energy minimizing contours (i.e., "snakes") of Kass, Witkin and Terzopolous <ref> [14] </ref>. The stochastic completion field can be thought of as a probability distribution representing a family of snakes with given end conditions. This connection is strengthened by the inclusion of the anisotropic decay mechanism, since this device plays a role similiar to the "external" energy term of the snake formulation.

Reference-contexts: Modal completions correspond to surface boundaries which are nominally visible (i.e., no occluding surface is presumed to be hiding them). Illusory contours are therefore modal completions. Amodal completions are nominally occluded (i.e., an intervening surface is presumed to be hiding them). Kellman and Shipley <ref> [15] </ref> and others (e.g., [22, 33]) hypothesize that modal and amodal completions are computed by the same underlying process. According to this view, whether or not a 16 completion is perceived as modal or amodal is determined by a later process devoted to organizing surfaces.

As an anti-aliasing measure, a unit mass is distributed proportionally among the two discrete orientations straddling the nominal maximum and minimum.

Reference-contexts: Given some means of associating probabilities with completion shapes, then the stochastic completion field (i.e., C (u; v; )) represents the probability that a completion will pass through point (u; v) with orientation . Williams and Jacobs [34] and Mumford <ref> [20] </ref> have independently proposed that the prior distribution of boundary completion shape can be modeled by a particle undergoing a particular kind of random walk. 3 Both show that for this random walk, the maximum likelihood path that a particle will take between two positions and orientations is a curve of <p> The network computation is based upon a finite difference scheme for 3 A similiar model is implicit in Cox, Rehg and Hingorani's [4] use of the Kalman filter in their work on edge tracking. 2 solving the Fokker-Planck equation identified by Mumford <ref> [20] </ref>.

The outputs of oppositely oriented filters are combined through a non-linear operation consisting of thresholding followed by a logical AND function. Consequently, the state of activity of an individual neuron does not correspond in an obvious way to a probability or other physical quantity. <p> Our method differs in many details, and most fundamentally, in that we compute a probability distribution based upon a stochastic model of contour formation, rather than a single contour minimizing a cost 4 function. 3 Review of Previous Method Like Mumford <ref> [20] </ref>, we defined a random walk which on average generates short, smooth paths. Unlike the familiar two-dimensional isotropic random walk, where a particle's state is simply its position in the plane, the particles of the random walk we defined possess both position and orientation. <p> The difference is in the way the source and sink fields are computed. In the new algorithm, the source field is computed by integrating the Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic process identified by Mumford <ref> [20] </ref>. The probability density function representing a particle's position at time t is given by: p (x; y; ; t) = p (x; y; ; 0) + 0 @t @P = cos @x @P + 2 =2 @ 2 1=t P where P is p (x; y; ; t).

Rock's notion of stimulus conformity can be used to explain why illusory contours (unlike amodal completions) cannot cross large brightness discontinuities.

Reference-contexts: That is, the shape and salience of the completion is not solely a function of characteristics of the pair of elements it bridges, but is also a function of the intervening pattern of image brightnesses.

Reference-contexts: In a recent paper, Thornber and Williams <ref> [30] </ref> derive analytic expressions for the stochastic completion field (and for its expected value and variance). These analyses are independent of the particular algorithm used to compute the stochastic completion field and therefore apply equally to the output of our previous method and to the method introduced in this paper. <p> The probability that a particle beginning at (0; 0; 0) reaches (x; y; ) before it decays is approximated by the fraction of simulated trajectories beginning at (0; 0; 0) which intersect the region (x 1:0; y 1:0; =72). In a recent paper, Thornber and Williams <ref> [30] </ref> describe an analytic expression for the Green's function which can be used to compute filters which are significantly more accurate than those computed by the Monte Carlo method. <p> The small kernel method shares this first source of error and since we are only concerned with additional inaccuracy due to the use of the small kernel method, the second source of error does not concern us (see Thornber and Williams <ref> [30] </ref> for an analysis of the accuracy of the Monte Carlo method). The stochastic process simulated by the small kernel method differs from that of the previous method in two ways. <p> The completion field is summed over all orientations and superimposed on the brightness gradient magnitude image for illustrative purposes. Figure 5 (c) shows the same, but this result was computed with a filter generated by numerical integration of the analytic expression for G derived by Thornber and Williams <ref> [30] </ref>. This is by far the most accurate method of computing the stochastic completion field. Finally, Figure 5 (d) shows the stochastic completion field computed using repeated small kernel convolution.

According to this view, whether or not a 16 completion is perceived as modal or amodal is determined by a later process devoted to organizing surfaces. <p> We are not concerned here with all of the factors which play a role in determining whether or not a completion will be perceived as modal or amodal. Some of these factors are beyond the scope of the current paper (they concern the topological validity of the surface organization <ref> [33] </ref>). Rock [26] emphasizes one factor, termed stimulus conformity, which is relevant to our current discussion. Rock's notion of stimulus conformity can be used to explain why illusory contours (unlike amodal completions) cannot cross large brightness discontinuities.
