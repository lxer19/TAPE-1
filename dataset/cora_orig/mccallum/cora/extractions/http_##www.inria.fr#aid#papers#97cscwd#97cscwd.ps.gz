Abstract: This paper describes an argumentation system for cooperative design applications on the Web. The system provides experts involved in such procedures means of expressing and weighing their individual arguments and preferences, in order to argue for or against the selection of a certain choice. It supports defeasible and qualitative reasoning in the presence of ill-structured information. Argumentation is performed through a set of discourse acts which call a variety of procedures for the propagation of information in the corresponding discussion graph. The paper also reports on the integration of Case Based Reasoning techniques, used to resolve current design issues by considering previous similar situations, and the specitcation of similarity measures between the various argumentation items, the aim being to estimate the variations among opinions of the designers involved in cooperative design.

Reference-contexts: Dierent elements of the argumentation, even in the same debate, do not necessarily need the same type of evidence. Quoting the well-used legal domain example, the arguments required to indict someone need not be as convincing as those needed to convict him <ref> [5] </ref>. Therefore, a generic argumentation system requires dierent proof standards (work on AI and Law uses the term burdens of proof).

Reference-contexts: Active positions are considered accepted due to the discussion underneath (e.g., strong supporting arguments, no counterarguments), while inactive positions are considered rejected. The mechanisms for the calculation of activation labels are described in detail in <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Integrating CBR techniques The representation of a case should clearly reect the purpose for which it will be used. In order to provide the ability of extracting multiple views of cases representing the same data, we follow a hybrid approach based on the classical case representation <ref> [13] </ref> and the structure of the argumentation graph. A case consists of a set of argumentation elements that directly depend on the current status of the discourse and the designers' viewpoints [7,10].

Reference-contexts: IV. Similarity measures This section reports on some appropriate measures in order for designers to eectively consider the multitude of the existing solutions in the type of problems described above. As pointed out in <ref> [16] </ref>, approximation is inherent in applications of fuzzy set theory, and it is automatically implied in such cases. Many measures of similarity of fuzzy values, together with interesting properties, have been recently proposed in the literature (e.g., see [1517]).
