Reference-contexts: The primary component is permitted to make progress, and other components are forced to shut down. Processes within non-primary components reconnect to the primary component when communication is restored. An alternative non-primary partition approach is used in the Transis <ref> [ADKM92, DMS94] </ref> and Totem [MAMSA94,MMSA + 96] systems in which any component that can reach internal agreement on its membership is permitted to continue operation. However, only a single component of the system is the primary one. Applications might continue to be available in non-primary components.

Reference-contexts: The time needed for a host to receive a message is normally about 10% higher than the sending time since interrupts need to be handled <ref> [AKS96] </ref>. It is set to t r (u) = 1:1 fi t s (u). The queuing delays incurred at the hosts and routers are also simulated by ns. The message header size is set to h = 32 bytes which is enough for most transport protocols [AKS96,vR96].

Reference-contexts: Also, the hierarchy is designed such that each member knows about all of its ancestors, so that when its parent crashes, it connects to its grandparent. 68 4.3.2 S Train Adding a tree structure to Train results in S Train <ref> [AMMSB95] </ref>. We assign the root to be the coordinator. There is a cyclic order 1, 2, : : :, b among sibling members of each sub-group. Each member (d; e) maintains a sequence number array R (d;e) with m elements.

Reference-contexts: In the Internet, these routing trees are constructed using protocols such as Core Based Tree (CBT) <ref> [BFC93] </ref>, Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [WPD88] and Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [DEF + 94].

Reference-contexts: In distributed database systems, partial failures of transactions can lead to inconsistent results. Therefore, termination of a transaction that updates distributed data has to be coordinated among its participants. In the atomic commit protocols <ref> [BHG87] </ref>, a process can not commit a transaction until everybody else has agreed to commit. This is similar to message stability detection protocols in which all processes must deliver a message if any does so.

Reference-contexts: This analysis becomes very complex if all members are gossiping in each step or if more than one piece of information are propagated in the group using the gossip technique. Usually approximations and/or upper bounds are used instead (for example, see <ref> [BHO + 98] </ref>). We conduct the following analysis based on the same simplification proposed by van Renesse et al. in [vRMH98] and we calculate an upper bound on the number of steps needed to achieve certain probability of an incomplete stability detection as in [vRMH98].

Reference-contexts: The sender s receives the NAK for m 2 after it receives m 2 , it ignores the NAK accordingly since it knows some other member has already re-multicast m 2 . The first variation is used by Birman in the ISIS reliable multicast protocol <ref> [Bir93] </ref> in a local area network (LAN) environment. The second variation is proposed by Ramakrishnan and Jain in the "Negative Acknowledgments with Periodic Polling" (NAPP) protocol [RJ87] for a LAN. Ja-cobson has used similar ideas to implement a reliable multicast protocol suitable 16 for the wide area network (WAN) [Jac93]. <p> For example, the research reported here was triggered by a problem that a Swiss bank faced when using the Isis group communication system <ref> [Bir93] </ref>. In their set-up, they had two server machines and about a hundred PC workstations organized in a group. The servers multicast updates to replicated data maintained at each of the workstations. The updates had to be delivered atomically, in spite of server failures. <p> To obtain strong systemwide guarantees, a protocol must wait for communication to be reestablished in at least one side of the partition. In the primary partition approach pioneered in the Isis system <ref> [Bir93] </ref>, one and only one of these components is designated as the primary component. The primary component is permitted to make progress, and other components are forced to shut down. Processes within non-primary components reconnect to the primary component when communication is restored.
Reference: [Bla90] <author> R. E. Blahut. </author> <title> Digital Transmission of Information. </title> <publisher> Addison-Wesley, </publisher> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: Each network in the simulations consists of nodes and links. We need to assign realistic parameters to links and nodes. A transmission link can be characterized by two parameters: bandwidth and latency. The bandwidth of a link measures its information carrying capacity <ref> [Bla90] </ref>. Using a plumbing analogy, it is the width of the "information pipe". A link carries information in the form of analog symbols, where a symbol may correspond to one or more bits.

Reference-contexts: The protocol is based on the gossiping technique pioneered in the Clearinghouse project in the 1980's [DGH + 87,OD83]. Over a decade before that, Baker and Shostak <ref> [BS72] </ref> describe a gossip protocol using ladies and telephones before the widespread use of computers and networks. The goal of gossip protocols is to distribute information in the group. The mechanism is for each member to forward new information to randomly chosen members periodically.
Reference: [Car85] <author> R. Carr. </author> <title> The Tandem global update protocol, </title> <month> June </month> <year> 1985. </year>
Reference-contexts: Lost ACKs from non-coordinators will prevent the coordinator from getting all 38 information in the group. This problem is solved by making non-coordinators send unicast ACK messages to the coordinator repetitively. In an extension to the Tandem global update protocol <ref> [Car85] </ref> and the Amoeba total ordering protocol [KTHB89], a particular version of CoordP is employed as their stability detection algorithm. The original Tandem global update protocol works as follows. One member is designated as the sequencer of the group.

Reference-contexts: Message losses are detected by time-outs, and result in message retransmissions. The Tandem global update protocol allows at most one update to be multicast at a time in the group. Therefore the performance is very bad when the group size is large. In <ref> [CdBM94] </ref>, Cristian et al. propose an extension to the global update protocol called the Positive Acknowledgment or PA protocol that allows concurrent multicasts.

Reference-contexts: The flow control, transmission error recovery, and buffer space management issues seem to interact in a rather complicated way [WM87]. We follow the discipline first proposed by Clark et al. in <ref> [CLZ87] </ref>, whereby any transport protocol that operates efficiently decouples flow control and error control. Mixing the two in a single mechanism can make flow control vulnerable to transmission errors and delays. Under this discipline, the protocol uses a window for error control only. <p> A TCP transmitter stops at the window boundary and waits for a new acknowledgment before it can continue. This wait for synchronization serves as TCP's flow control mechanism and can often cause performance degradation. On the other hand, protocols like NETBLT <ref> [CLZ87] </ref>, Blast File Transfer Protocol [The92], and StarBurst Multicast File Transfer Protocol [Sta97] separate error control from their rate-based flow control mechanism. NETBLT maintains a large window at the sender, whereas Blast FTP and StarBurst MFTP keep the entire file to be transferred in the error control window.

Reference-contexts: Under the receiver reliable multicast model where group members do not know the individual addresses of other members, one has to rely on other schemes to construct subsets for gossip messages. One such scheme is to use the Time-To-Live (TTL) <ref> [Com95] </ref> field in IP packets to limit the scope of a gossip. The TTL field 52 is initialized to a non-zero number when an IP packet is sent out by the source. Every time the packet is forwarded by a router, the TTL field decrements by one.

Reference-contexts: The total number of messages processed by each member is 4, out of which 2 are sent and 2 are received. Once this protocol starts, each member repeatedly sends the same message to 44 the next member in line. This mechanism effectively combats message losses. In the Train <ref> [Cri91] </ref> and Totem single-ring [MMSA + 96] protocols, the Train protocol is used to offer message stability detection. In the Train protocol, there is a cyclic order among group members. A train containing a sequence of messages circulates from one member to another in this order.

Reference-contexts: SRM uses the first approach, employing a concept called Application Level Framing (ALF) proposed by Clark and Tennenhouse in <ref> [CT90] </ref>. In the design principle ALF, the application breaks the data into suitable aggregates called Application Data Units, or ADUs. ADUs will take the place of the packet as the unit of manipulation. <p> The problem of buffer management is largely ignored in existing scalable reliable multicast protocols in the literature. Based on the concept of Application Level 21 Framing (ALF) <ref> [CT90] </ref>, the issue of how long a message should be buffered is handled by the application layer. For example, in SRM, all messages belong to the current white-board session are stored in the buffer of each group member.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, forthcoming communication systems must scale well with respect to both number of group members and geographical expansion. Meanwhile, widespread availability of IP multicast <ref> [DC90] </ref> and the MBone [Kum95] have dramatically increased the geographic extent and the size of communication groups.

Reference-contexts: To see the effect of the subset size on the protocol, the subset size is varied from 1 to 5. In a WAN, IP-multicast is not efficient in sending messages to small groups that are constantly changing <ref> [DL93] </ref>, thus k unicasts are used to send gossip messages to each subset of size k. For the fixed group size n = 200 with m = 50 senders, tests are conducted in two categories: the dense test and the sparse test.

However, only a single component of the system is the primary one. Applications might continue to be available in non-primary components.

Reference-contexts: The process of finding the flat portion has two parts. The first part finds a step interval that achieves a near-minimum TPR, and the second part finds a window around that step interval. If TPR can be expressed as an analytical function, then New-ton's method <ref> [DS93] </ref> can find its minimum. Otherwise, better approaches exist in experimental optimization. One such approach is the golden-ratio method [han79]. Figures 5.8 and 5.9 present the two-part algorithm for finding the window of optimal step intervals. Different groups and network topology require different input values for the algorithm.

Zhang. </author> <title> A reliable multicast framework for light-weight sessions and application level framing. </title> <journal> IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, </journal> <month> November </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: There are also applications that do require reliable multicast such as shared white-boards (for example, wb <ref> [FJL + 96] </ref>). Many other multicast applications also require reliable delivery of data to all the receivers. For example, reliable multicast is used in Distributed Interactive Simulations (DIS) for dynamic terrain updates [HSC95]. <p> Ja-cobson has used similar ideas to implement a reliable multicast protocol suitable 16 for the wide area network (WAN) [Jac93]. The third variation is used in the Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) protocol designed by Floyd et al. <ref> [FJL + 96] </ref>, where any member which has the requested message may conduct the retransmission. This technique effectively reduces the burden on the sender and shortens the retransmission delay. <p> As with CoordP, this protocol is executed periodically, and as a result, an INFO message will compensate for the one lost in the previous step. FullDist is used as the stability detection protocol in Horus [vRBM96], En semble [Hay98] and SRM <ref> [FJL + 96] </ref>. Horus is a group communication system which offers great flexibility in the properties provided by protocols. It supports dynamic group membership, mes 42 sage ordering, synchronization and failure handling. In the Horus architecture, protocols are constructed dynamically by stacking micro-protocols, which support a common interface. <p> The network topologies are based on some generic network simulation schemes used in <ref> [FJL + 96] </ref>. To gain insight on scalability of different stability detection protocols, the simulation is conducted in a set of wide-area networks. Each network in the simulations consists of nodes and links. We need to assign realistic parameters to links and nodes. <p> Therefore, messages are dropped because of the lack of buffer space. To avoid the implosion problem in FullDist, it is common practice to spread the multicast of INFO messages from each member. This technique is used in the management of session messages of SRM <ref> [FJL + 96] </ref>.

Horus is a group communication system which offers great flexibility in the properties provided by protocols. It supports dynamic group membership, mes 42 sage ordering, synchronization and failure handling. <p> In the Horus architecture, protocols are constructed dynamically by stacking micro-protocols, which support a common interface. Each micro-protocol offers a small integral set of communication properties, and Horus implements them as different layers. One such micro-protocol is the message stability detection protocol. Horus and its next generation system Ensemble <ref> [Hay98] </ref> implement a set of stability protocols in separate layers so users can pick the appropriate one for their application. FullDist is one of the stability protocols offered by Horus and Ensemble. In SRM, each member periodically multicasts session messages to report the sequence number state for active senders. <p> First, it incorporates a gossip-style failure detection protocol. Second, it propagates membership changes throughout the entire group using gossip messages, and the normal operation of each group member is not affected when membership change happens. Gossip is implemented in the Ensemble system <ref> [Hay98] </ref> to aid various scalable group communication. Under the receiver reliable multicast model where group members do not know the individual addresses of other members, one has to rely on other schemes to construct subsets for gossip messages.

It is used for dissemina 1 2 tion of stock quotes to a large number of clients, and for distribution of software products to groups of customers. It is also used by web servers to send updates of web pages to their proxies. <p> This hierarchy reduces both the amount of state information required at the sender, and 18 the number of ACKs collected by the sender. The receiver-initiated protocol can also benefit from a hierarchy. For example, the Log-Based Receiver-reliable Multicast (LBRM) developed by Holbrook et al. <ref> [HSC95] </ref> uses a hierarchy of log servers to store all multicast messages indefinitely. Receivers request retransmissions of lost messages from a log server. The log servers significantly reduce the sender's burden of handling retransmissions.

Reference-contexts: Lost ACKs from non-coordinators will prevent the coordinator from getting all 38 information in the group. This problem is solved by making non-coordinators send unicast ACK messages to the coordinator repetitively. In an extension to the Tandem global update protocol [Car85] and the Amoeba total ordering protocol <ref> [KTHB89] </ref>, a particular version of CoordP is employed as their stability detection algorithm. The original Tandem global update protocol works as follows. One member is designated as the sequencer of the group.

Reference-contexts: This section focuses on the scalability aspect of the structured protocols. Hierarchical structures have been used in various reliable multicast protocols in distributed systems [BFvR97,GVvR96,Mit97,MMSA + 96] and barrier synchronization algorithms <ref> [MCS91] </ref> in parallel systems. To improve scalability significantly, we derive three structured stability detection protocols by adding a spanning tree structure to the basic protocols. They are called S CoordP, S Train, and S Gossip since they are derived from CoordP, Train, and Gossip respectively.

A tree topology is the most general one since it combines aspects of both chains and stars.

Reference-contexts: Once this protocol starts, each member repeatedly sends the same message to 44 the next member in line. This mechanism effectively combats message losses. In the Train [Cri91] and Totem single-ring <ref> [MMSA + 96] </ref> protocols, the Train protocol is used to offer message stability detection. In the Train protocol, there is a cyclic order among group members. A train containing a sequence of messages circulates from one member to another in this order.

For a large randomly labeled tree, the probability that a particular node has a degree of at most four approaches 0.98 <ref> [Pal85] </ref>, therefore, the underlying network 78 used in the simulation is a balanced bounded-degree tree where interior nodes all have degree four.

Reference-contexts: Mixing the two in a single mechanism can make flow control vulnerable to transmission errors and delays. Under this discipline, the protocol uses a window for error control only. In practice, some protocols follow this discipline, and some do not. Protocols like TCP <ref> [Pos81] </ref> use the same window both for flow control and for error control. A TCP transmitter stops at the window boundary and waits for a new acknowledgment before it can continue. This wait for synchronization serves as TCP's flow control mechanism and can often cause performance degradation. <p> The message size in other protocols is only 32 + 4 fi m bytes, smaller than the size of gossip message. Since a typical WAN can handle packets shorter than 500 bytes without fragmentation <ref> [Pos81] </ref>, packet fragmentation is not considered in the simulations. 5.3 The Gossip Protocol For a given underlying network topology, set of group members, set of senders, and patterns for message sending and message loss, it is possible to analyze the behavior of the Gossip protocol with a fixed step interval, and

Reference-contexts: The first variation is used by Birman in the ISIS reliable multicast protocol [Bir93] in a local area network (LAN) environment.

Reference-contexts: In the atomic commit protocols [BHG87], a process can not commit a transaction until everybody else has agreed to commit. This is similar to message stability detection protocols in which all processes must deliver a message if any does so. In parallel computing, barrier synchronization <ref> [SKB89] </ref> requires that all processes execute the barrier construct before any process can proceed past it to the next statement. Every process has to know if all other processes have reached the barrier before it can proceed again.

Reference-contexts: The Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol (RMTP) developed at Bell-Labs by Sabnani et al. <ref> [SLPB97] </ref> employs a hierarchy by dividing the receivers into some number of subsets and using Designated Receivers (DRs), one per subset, to collect ACKs from other members in that subset. Thus, the sender only keeps the list of DRs, and each DR keeps membership information of its subset.

Reference-contexts: To ensure timely detection of failures when data traffic is low or unidirectional, some systems require each member to multicast "I-am-alive" session messages in the group periodically. In general, failure detection algorithms can be divided into two categories under the same time-out principle according to Vogels in <ref> [Vog96] </ref>. The first scheme uses a heartbeat mechanism, where each process sends out "I-am-alive" session messages in the group of processes using multiple point-to-point messages or a single IP-multicast message.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the total number of messages processed by each member is n + 1. As with CoordP, this protocol is executed periodically, and as a result, an INFO message will compensate for the one lost in the previous step. FullDist is used as the stability detection protocol in Horus <ref> [vRBM96] </ref>, En semble [Hay98] and SRM [FJL + 96].

Reference-contexts: Poll periods, time-outs, and retransmission limits are 26 also configurable by the application. When scaled up to more than several dozens of members, many failure detectors are either unreasonably slow, or make too many false detections as reported by van Renesse et al. in <ref> [vRMH98] </ref>. The reason is that in either the heartbeat method or the polling method, the large number of "I-am-alive" messages and polling requests add unnecessary loads to the system. 3.1.2 Gossip-style algorithm We propose a new gossip-style algorithm to do failure detection. <p> The value K fail depends on the gossiping rate (the length of step interval) and the subset size during each gossip step. K fail is selected so that the probability that anybody makes an erroneous failure detection is less than some small threshold P mistake . 29 In <ref> [vRMH98] </ref>, van Renesse et al. conduct a statistical analysis for a better version of the protocol where during each gossip step, only one member is gossiping. This member is chosen at random and chooses one other member to gossip to at random. <p> Usually approximations and/or upper bounds are used instead (for example, see [BHO + 98]). We conduct the following analysis based on the same simplification proposed by van Renesse et al. in <ref> [vRMH98] </ref> and we calculate an upper bound on the number of steps needed to achieve certain probability of an incomplete stability detection as in [vRMH98]. In practice, each member gossips at regular step intervals, but the intervals are not synchronized. <p> We conduct the following analysis based on the same simplification proposed by van Renesse et al. in <ref> [vRMH98] </ref> and we calculate an upper bound on the number of steps needed to achieve certain probability of an incomplete stability detection as in [vRMH98]. In practice, each member gossips at regular step intervals, but the intervals are not synchronized. In fact, we intentionally scatter the gossips from different members in each step to reduce message burstiness. Message propagation time is typically much shorter than the length of step intervals.

The flow control, transmission error recovery, and buffer space management issues seem to interact in a rather complicated way <ref> [WM87] </ref>. We follow the discipline first proposed by Clark et al. in [CLZ87], whereby any transport protocol that operates efficiently decouples flow control and error control. Mixing the two in a single mechanism can make flow control vulnerable to transmission errors and delays.
