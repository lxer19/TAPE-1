Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for solving problems involving constraints on multiple paths. Examples of constraints considered in the paper include requirements that vehicles on separate paths (1) maintain line-of-sight (2) maintain ability to communicate between the vehicles or (3) maintain a minimum and/or maximum separation at all times. These constraints are all expressed within the theoretical framework. Three algorithms for computing multiple paths that satisfy constraints on the vehicles traversing the paths are presented.

Reference-contexts: It uses the Hybrid Knowledge Base paradigm, due to Lu, Nerode and Subrahmanian [5] to provide deductive database support for multiple modes of reasoning and multiple types of data. One of the many applications of HERMES has been to link HERMES to route planners <ref> [3] </ref> developed by the U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center (TEC). <p> The need to specify constraints between vehicles moving on separate paths was one of the principal motivators for the work reported in this paper. A second route planner developed by the U.S. Army Topographic Engineering has a heirarchic structure with planning done at both the grid and graph levels <ref> [3] </ref>. It first computes an optimum path using Afl and then successively computes a second and third path subject to the constraint that there be no overlap with previously computed paths. <p> Reference <ref> [3] </ref> presents a counter-example. A different approach to the Multi-Constraint CSOP Problem is to generate the multi-path solution within the A ? algorithm, thereby optimizing the sum of the paths subject to the constraints of the multi-constraint CSOP problem. <p> We can now write an algorithm to intelligently search for the optimum solution as follows: Algorithm 3 is most likely to be useful within the context of software such as TEC's heirarchical route planner <ref> [3] </ref> in which the number of nodes in the search tree is much less than the number of nodes for a grid-based route planner covering the same physical area.
