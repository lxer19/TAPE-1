Title: An Evolutionary Algorithm for Parametric Array Signal Processing

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm for solving parameter optimization problems in parametric array signal processing. The method utilises the niche concept to maintain a population capable of exploring the search space while preserving the diversity to prevent the premature convergence. The former is achieved by a niche-based adaptive mutation scheme and the latter by a niche-based local selection scheme. Simulations demonstrate its viability and superiority over the alternating projection method currently used to solve such parameter optimization tasks.

Reference-contexts: Another way of alleviating computational difficulty with the ML approach is to develop efficient methods for computing the ML estimator. Recently various iterative methods have been proposed to find the optimal parameters based on the ML principle <ref> [8, 1] </ref>. These iterative methods are simple and efficient but have a fundamental limitation, namely local convergence: they converge to a local minimum instead of the global minimum of the objective function. <p> Therefore finding optimization techniques capable of solving complex parameter estimation is one of fundamental issues in parametric array signal processing. In the literature two methods have been developed to find the ML estimator of DOA's. The first one is the well known EM method <ref> [8, 1] </ref> in which the conditional expectation of the log-likelihood of the ML estimator is first cal-culated as the function of the unknown parameters and then maximized with respect to the unknown parameters.

Reference-contexts: Evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated wide and successful applicability in a large number of practical applications. It has recently been shown that evolutionary algorithms can be applied to solve the problems in digital signal processing such as pole-zero system identification <ref> [2] </ref>. However, no effort has been made in developing efficient methods to solve the optimization problem in parametric array signal processing. The aim of this paper is to present an evolutionary algorithm to estimate the DOA's of narrow-band sources.

The first one maintains the diversity of population by allowing only a fraction of the population to be replaced by newly generated offspring.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of the ML technique lies in its known asymptotic efficiency, that is, it achieves the Cramer-Rao bound on the estimation error variance. The employment of the ML principle to parametric array signal processing can be traced back to the work of Ksisenski and MaGhee <ref> [7] </ref> in 1968 in attempting to estimate the DOA's of two plane waves. However, the ML estimator is computationally intractable since it needs a multidimensional nonlinear optimization. Historically, the reactions to this complexity problem can be divided into two categories.

Reference-contexts: Historically, the reactions to this complexity problem can be divided into two categories. The first is to exploit the structure of the data model, and as a result, several eigenstructure based methods such as MUSIC [13], Min-Norm <ref> [9] </ref> and ESPRIT [11] have been proposed. These methods are eigenstructure-based and eigendecomposition of the spatial covariance matrix is required, which restrict their applications: they provide significantly less accurate estimation especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cases and they cannot deal with the case of coherent signals.
