Title: Potential and Achievable Parallelism in the Unsymmetric-Pattern Multifrontal LU Factorization Method for Sparse Matrices  
Author: Steven M. Hadfield and Timothy A. Davis 
Date: June 1994  
Note: Tech. Report TR-94-006; Proc. Fifth SIAM Conf. on Applied Linear Algebra,  
Abstract: The unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method of Davis and Duff [1] generalizes earlier multifrontal approaches to LU factorization by removing the assumption of a symmetric-pattern of nonzeros in the sparse matrix. As a result, the underlying computational structure becomes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) instead of a tree. This research explores the potential parallelism available in the unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method using both unbounded and bounded parallelism models based on this DAG. The bounded parallelism model is extended to reflect the performance characteristics of the nCUBE 2 distributed memory multiprocessor to investigate the achievable parallelism. Finally, a factorization-only version of the method is implemented on the nCUBE 2 and its achieved parallelism and scalability evaluated.

Reference-contexts: All of the processors in the frontal matrix's subcube then update their active columns using these multipliers. This is commonly refered to as a fan-out algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. Node weights correspond to a predicted parallel execution time. This predicted time is based on an analytical model of the fan-out algorithm with 4 Hadfield and Davis specific parameters set according to results from an implementation and evaluation of this algorithm on the nCUBE 2.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 2. Distributed Memory Model Results 5 Implementation Results Within the implementation, factorization of the frontal matrices is done using a pipelined, fan-out algorithm similar to that used in the distributed memory model <ref> [7] </ref>. With pipelining, however, the processor owning the next pivot column will update only that column and compute and send the next pivot's multipliers before doing the rest of the updates for the current pivot. This allows the communications to be overlapped with computations.
