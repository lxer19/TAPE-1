Abstract: We present and verify the Adaptive Link-State Protocol (ALP), a new link-state routing protocol that does not require the state of each link to be flooded to the entire internetwork, or to entire areas if hierarchical routing is used. A router in ALP disseminates link-state updates incrementally to its neighbors for only those links along paths used to reach destinations. Link-state updates are validated using time stamps and contain the same information used in other link-state protocols. For the case of neighbor routers connected through a broadcast medium, a designated router is distributedly elected for each link state reported over the medium, rather than requiring a designated router to report every topology change over the broadcast medium, like OSPF does. Simulation experiments illustrate that ALP is as efficient as the Distributed-Bellman Ford algorithm when distances to destinations do not increase and resources do not fail, and more efficient than traditional link-state protocols based on flooding after distances increase or resources fail. ALP also outperforms the link-vector algorithm (LVA), which is the only prior routing algorithm based on selective dissemination of link states.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The majority of the work on routing protocols for internetworks has proceeded in two main directions: distance-vector protocols (e.g., BGP [12], IDRP [13], RIP [7], and EIGRP <ref> [1] </ref>) and link-state protocols (e.g., ISO IS-IS [8] and OSPF [9]). In a distance-vector protocol, routers exchange path information (e.g., distance or complete path to one or more destinations) and compute their preferred paths in a distributed manner.

Reference-contexts: Proof: The proof is by induction on the number of hops of a shortest path to a destination, and is basically a generalization of the proof for SPTA <ref> [2] </ref>. Consider the shortest path from router s 0 to a destination j at time t s , and let h be the number of hops along such a path. For h = 1, the path from s 0 to j consists of one of the router's outgoing links.

Reference-contexts: Several routing algorithms based on distance vectors have been proposed to eliminate the counting-to-infinity problem that prevents the Bellman-Ford algorithm from working efficiently in large networks (e.g., <ref> [5, 3, 11] </ref>) and a number of these algorithms have been shown to outperform the traditional approach used in implementing link-state routing. Most approaches to link-state routing are based on topology broadcast [4, 10]. Unfortunately, disseminating complete link-state information to all routers incurs excessive communication overhead. <p> Because link-states are deleted from the topology graph of a router, rather than after receiving explicit delete updates from neighbors, ALP incurs less communication overhead than LVA. ALP also compares favorably against recent distance vectors based on source tracing <ref> [3] </ref> [11], or the diffusion of distances [5], which do solve the looping problems of RIP and RIP-2.

Reference-contexts: Most approaches to link-state routing are based on topology broadcast [4, 10]. Unfortunately, disseminating complete link-state information to all routers incurs excessive communication overhead. The link-vector algorithm (LVA) <ref> [6] </ref> was recently proposed to avoid the overhead of topology broadcast when using link-state information. <p> Note that router y does not inform its neighbors that it removed links (B; z), (B; q) and (u; g) from its source graph, as would be the case in LVA <ref> [6] </ref>, but makes the links to transition from State 1 to State 2 (see Figure 4). <p> To verify this, we ran a number of simulation experiments to compare its average performance against DBF, topology-broadcast (called LSA in prior literature), and LVA. We used the same topology and experiment reported in <ref> [6] </ref> in order to compare ALP against the best-performing published results for other approaches. The performance metrics consist of the number of steps and update messages that are required for each algorithm to converge (i.e., the algorithm stops sending messages), and the size of these updates. <p> Update messages are processed one at a time in the order in which they arrive. Like LVA and LSA, ALP uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the local shortest-path tree. The results presented are based on simulations for the DOE-ESNET topology <ref> [6] </ref> which was used in order to simply use published simulation results for the competing approaches.
