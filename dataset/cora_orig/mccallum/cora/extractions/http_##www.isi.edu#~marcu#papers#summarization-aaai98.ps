Abstract: Researchers in discourse have long hypothesized that the nuclei of a rhetorical structure tree provide a good summary of the text for which that tree was built. In this paper, I discuss a psycholinguistic experiment that validates this hypothesis, but that also shows that the distinction between nuclei and satellites is not sufficient if we want to build summaries of very high quality. I empirically compare various techniques for mapping discourse trees into partial orders that reflect the importance of the elementary textual units in texts and I discuss both their strengths and weaknesses. Researchers in discourse have long hypothesized that the nuclei of a rhetorical structure tree provide a good summary of the text for which that tree was built (Mann & Thompson 1988; Matthiessen & Thompson 1988; Hobbs 1993; Polanyi 1993; Sparck Jones 1993; Ono, Sumita, & Miike 1994). And a psycholinguistic experiment that was designed to check the validity of this hypothesis (Marcu 1997a) showed that discourse trees can be used effectively in text summarization. More precisely, the experiment showed that the importance scores obtained on the basis of both manually and automatically built discourse trees yielded a partial order with respect to the importance of clause-like units in a text that matched the units considered important by human judges significantly better than random. Although these results confirm the adequacy of using discourse trees for text summarization, they are still far from perfect. In this paper, I use data from the same experiment to investigate the reasons for the imperfect results. On the basis of this investigation, I suggest a number of techniques that can be used to improve the results of discourse-based summarizers. In the experiment on discourse trees and summaries (Marcu 1997a; 1997c), I used five texts from Scientific American that ranged in size from 161 to 725 words. I broke the texts into 160 elementary textual units and asked 13 independent judges to rate each textual unit according to its importance to a potential summary. The judges assigned a score of 2 to the units that they believed to be very important, 1 to those that they considered somewhat important, and 0 to those that they considered unimportant and which should not appear in any summary. The percent agreement among judges was high (71%) and statistically significant. Overall, a majority of judges labelled 36 of the 160 units as very important. In addition, two computational linguists built rhetorical structure trees (RS-trees) for each of the five texts. Using a nuclearity-based mapping, which I will describe in detail in section 3, I assigned an importance score to each unit in each discourse tree. The score of each unit reflected its importance for a summary of the text in which it occurred. The agreement between the two analysts, which was computed on the basis of these scores, was high and statistically significant. I took the maximal scores computed for each textual unit from the RS-trees built by each analyst and selected a percentage of units that matched the percentage of important units selected by the judges for each of the five texts. Because the scores computed from the RS-trees yielded a partial order, I could not select in all cases the same number of units as the judges. In the cases in which there were ties, I selected a percentage of units that was closest to the one computed by judges. The overall recall and precision figures of the important units derived from the RS-trees with respect to the units labelled important by the judges were 56% and 66% respectively. In contrast, the average recall and precision for the same percentages of
