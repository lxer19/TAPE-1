Abstract: Search engines are among the most successful applications on the Web today. So many search engines have been created that it is difficult for users to know where they are, how to use them and what topics they best address. Meta-search engines reduce the user burden by dispatching queries to multiple search engines in parallel. The SavvySearch meta-search engine is designed to efficiently query other search engines by carefully selecting those search engines likely to return useful results and by responding to fluctuating load demands on the Web. SavvySearch learns to identify which search engines are most appropriate for particular queries, reasons about resource demands and represents an iterative parallel search strategy as a simple plan.

Reference-contexts: To find what they desire, users may need to query several search engines; meta-search engines automate this process by simultaneously submitting a single query to multiple search engines. The simplest meta-search engines are forms that allow the user to indicate which search engines should be contacted (e.g., All-In-One <ref> [Cross, 1995] </ref>, META Search [Services, 1996]). ProFusion [of Kansas DesignLab, ,Gauch et al., 1996] gives the user the choice of selecting search engines themselves or letting ProFusion select three of six robot based search engines using handbuilt rules.

Reference-contexts: Currently, SavvySearch processes over 20,000 queries each day and, based on electronic mail, has attracted a large well-satisfied user base. SavvySearch, as described here, is the result of almost two years of work and a series of studies <ref> [Dreilinger and Howe, to appear] </ref>. The present design of the resource reasoning and learning algorithm resulted, in part, from the results of these studies [Dreilinger, 1996].

Reference-contexts: Once the thresholds are passed, the penalties increase quadratically up to the worst possible values: zero for hits and time out of 45 seconds for response time. Details of these equations are available in <ref> [Dreilinger, 1996] </ref>. 2.3 Dispatching a Query The degree of parallelism determines how many search engines to query; the rank order determines which should be queried. SavvySearch dispatches the query in parallel 6 to each of the indicated search engines. <p> SavvySearch, as described here, is the result of almost two years of work and a series of studies [Dreilinger and Howe, to appear]. The present design of the resource reasoning and learning algorithm resulted, in part, from the results of these studies <ref> [Dreilinger, 1996] </ref>. We studied the effects of the learning by starting from a minimal meta-index (compiled from 2 days worth of data) and allowing it to accumulate experience over a 28 day period.

Reference-contexts: A variety of search engines are available, from general, robot based (e.g., AltaVista [Monier and Burrows, ], WebCrawler [Pinkerton, 1994]) to topic or area specific (e.g., FTPSearch <ref> [Egge et al., 1996] </ref>, DejaNews [Madere, 1995]). Each employs different algorithms for collecting, indexing and searching links; thus, each returns different results for similar queries. Empirical results indicate that no single search engine is likely to return 1 more than 45% of the relevant results [Selberg and Etzioni, 1995a].

Reference-contexts: Individual users appear to be best served by simultaneously searching every possible search engine on the Web for desired information. Yet, the process may waste Web resources: network load and search engine computation. We believe that a meta-search system can be a good Web citizen <ref> [Eichmann, 1994] </ref> by targeting those search engines likely to return useful results and responding to changing load demands on the Web. To provide this functionality, we incorporated simple AI techniques in a meta-search engine.
