Title: A Statistical Link between Learning and Evolution

Abstract: Widely replicated experimental findings show that faced with multiple variable reward outcomes, animals sample each proportional to their mean payoff. This finding is explained computationally using the Holland theorem, in which this style of sampling is optimal given certain assumptions about the distribution. Other adaptive phenomena which seem to be consistent with this law are discussed, and it is suggested that the 'adaptive problem' may be broadly similar across different domains.
