Reference-contexts: However, both NPB and TPB are important materials because of their superior chemical stability [16]. A thin layer of copper phthalocyanine between the hole transport and injector layers improves device stability <ref> [1] </ref>. The electron transport material aluminum 8-hydroxyquinoline (Alq 3 ), shown in Figure 2 (b), belongs to a class of fluorescent metal chelate complexes and serves as the light emitter [17]. The device operates by injecting holes and electrons into the organic layers from the anode and cathode, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Spots that deviated from per fect circles before merging with others tended to be elliptical, and the roundness of ellipses of various major-minor axis ratios suggested how much variation in roundness was reasonable.

Integrating the solution for the instantaneous point source with respect to time gives the continuous-point-source solution <ref> [5] </ref>. Dark spots are primarily a two-dimensional phenomenon, as readily seen by comparing the dark-spot's size to the device's thickness. Most observable dark spots range from 10 to 100 microns in radius, while the device's thickness is about 100 nanometers. <p> Thus, the rate water reaches the reaction front is proportional to the change in the spot's area. The rate water reaches the reaction front can be expressed as the flux of diffusant using the expression for concentration in 23 Equation 12 and Fick's Law <ref> [5] </ref>: F = c 2 rV ; (13) where the minus sign means materials moves in the direction of decreasing concentration. The flux of Equation 12 is easier to calculate in the large t limit.

Reference-contexts: Thus, as dark-spot size increases, the radial growth rate decreases. One possible physical mechanism for dark spots is water-induced delamination of the organic layers from the cathode. Recent studies [13] showed that the organic layer delami-nates easily from the cathode, while other studies <ref> [6] </ref> observed increased cathode roughness after aging, suggesting morphological changes in the device structure. In this model, water diffuses from a pinhole and reacts to delaminate the organics from the cathode, causing a lack of charge injection that quenches light emissions. <p> Encapsulated, however, the device lost only 40 percent of its light after over 1,000 hours. They observed that degradation was primarily due to nonemissive dark spots, and that interactions with water and oxygen were the likely cause. Do et al. <ref> [6] </ref> observed morphological changes in the cathode of a device after aging. They determined that oxidation of the metal cathode caused increased surface roughness, resulting in detachment of the cathode from the organic layers.

Reference-contexts: Following Frank <ref> [7] </ref>, dark-spot growth can be obtained by setting the total flux equal to the change in area. Thus, the change in the area is directly proportional to the flow of material from the source, and is analogous to blowing up a balloon.

Reference-contexts: The water would interact with the organic materials and causes separation from the poorly adhered cathode. Thus, the quenching of light caused by dark spots would be due to a lack of charge injection from cathode detachment. This mechanism differs from that of Fujihira et al. <ref> [8] </ref>, who suggested that interdiffusion of organic layers was a potential cause of dark spots. However, organic interdiffusion is not supported by observation that dark-spot growth is significantly slower in inert environments. Sheats et al. [15] suggest that a reaction proposed by Papadimitrakopoulus et al. [14] could cause dark spots.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 presents a description of the experimental apparatus and method-ology, and Section 5 presents the experimental results. Section 6 presents a derivation of dark-spot growth from the diffusion equation, and Section 7 summarizes the results and proposes directions for future work. 2 Background Researchers <ref> [9] </ref> first exploited the electroluminescent properties of aromatic hydrocarbons to construct organic LEDs in the 1960s. Organic LEDs devices offered several advantages over inorganic technologies, including high external quantum efficiencies (photons per electron), relatively simple sample preparation techniques, and the possibility of simple color control [18].

Reference-contexts: Despite the advantages, limited lifetimes, fabrication and packaging problems, and the 100 or more volts required for appreciable electroluminescence hampered organic LED development <ref> [10, 17, 15] </ref>. In 1987, Tang and VanSlyke [17] set the stage for present-day work on organic LEDs when they reported electroluminescence from a novel device structure with the application of just a few volts. The device consisted of a bilayer of thin-film organic materials sandwiched between electrodes. <p> Experiments have shown that recombination occurs in the Alq 3 about 50 angstroms from the junction, but the entire layer of Alq 3 serves as the emission zone because of exciton diffusion <ref> [10] </ref>. 4 Experimental Methodology An encapsulation box supplied with a continuous flow of humidified nitrogen housed the device. A slight positive pressure provided most of the encapsulation, with only a few liters 10 per minute of nitrogen flow required to maintain a steady humidity.

Reference-contexts: While the device's organic material are definitely anisotropic, the gap between the organics and the delaminated cathode where diffusion occurs can reasonably be assumed isotropic. Using separation of variables, a general series solution can be obtained. In the one-dimensional case, the general solution has the form <ref> [11] </ref>: U (x; t) = 2c t 0 4c 2 t d ; (5) where f () is the initial spatial distribution of diffusant.

Reference-contexts: Since the area measurement was a numerical count, the error in a spot's area was proportional to the square root of the number of pixels on a spot's perimeter, A = p p 2r. The corresponding equation for the error in the radius was obtained from the equation <ref> [12] </ref>: r = @A Substituting for r, A , and A: r = @A @ A 1 1 p 1 A 1 p 1 2r seems to be an upper limit on dark spot growth, but most spots grew more slowly. 6 Theoretical Treatment To infer a mechanism for dark-spot growth

Reference-contexts: The spots become visible early in the device's lifetime, and continue to grow until they coalesce and quench all light emissions. However, dark-spot growth slows as the device ages, and additional spots do not form later in the device's lifetime, suggesting they are caused by initial conditions. Studies <ref> [13] </ref> suggest that particulate contamination during device fabrication is a likely cause of dark-spot nucleation. Particles, such as dust, become embedded in the device during fabrication and cause irregularities that form pinholes|microscopic openings|in the top cathode, allowing oxygen and water to enter. <p> Thus, as dark-spot size increases, the radial growth rate decreases. One possible physical mechanism for dark spots is water-induced delamination of the organic layers from the cathode. Recent studies <ref> [13] </ref> showed that the organic layer delami-nates easily from the cathode, while other studies [6] observed increased cathode roughness after aging, suggesting morphological changes in the device structure. <p> They correlated the locations of increased cathode roughness and the locations of the dark spots, suggesting morphological changes in the cathode resulted in dark spots. McElvain et al. <ref> [13] </ref> undertook a detailed study of the degradation in bilayer-organic LEDs, and made several important findings. They observed that the number of dark spots did not increase over time, with most spots appearing during the initial hours of operation. <p> The model, based on the work of McElvain et al. <ref> [13] </ref>, assumes pinholes serve as point sources for the diffusion of water into the device. The water reacts with the organic compounds to delaminate the cathode and quench light output.

Reference-contexts: In this model, water diffuses from a pinhole and reacts to delaminate the organics from the cathode, causing a lack of charge injection that quenches light emissions. Another possible physical mechanism is suggested by a recently proposed reaction <ref> [14] </ref> where the light-emitting compound reacts with water and oxygen to produce a nonemissive polymer and more water. In this reaction, 4 the dual consumption and production of water would produce a virtually self-sustained reaction, resulting in a faster growth rate than water-consuming delamination. <p> However, organic interdiffusion is not supported by observation that dark-spot growth is significantly slower in inert environments. Sheats et al. [15] suggest that a reaction proposed by Papadimitrakopoulus et al. <ref> [14] </ref> could cause dark spots. The proposed reaction involves the oxidation of the electron-carrier and emitter Alq 3 , where water replaces the oxyquinoline moieties in the Alq 3 complex.

The proposed reaction involves the oxidation of the electron-carrier and emitter Alq 3 , where water replaces the oxyquinoline moieties in the Alq 3 complex. <p> In the large t limit, dark-spot growth is limited only by q, the rate material enters the device through the pinhole. The steady-state dependence on q agrees with qualitative observations that show a strong dependence of dark-spot growth on humidity <ref> [15] </ref>. The values of ff less than 0.5 suggest that, for a majority of the dark spots, growth is additionally limited by the effects of initial concentration transients. 7 Conclusions and Future Work In conclusion, dark spots are the result of water-induced delamination of the cathode from the organic layer.

Reference-contexts: The consumption and production of water would create a virtually self-sustaining reaction, causing dark spots to grow faster than in other mechanisms, such as delamination, that consume water. 3 Device Structure significant improvement over the bilayer structure introduced by Tang and VanSlyke <ref> [16, 17] </ref> in 1987.
