Abstract: The recent growth in use of the World-Wide Web in the Internet has caused a significant increase in the demand placed on Web servers. This increased load results in noticeably longer response times for users. We propose an approach to using multicast in the delivery of Web resources that reduces the load on servers as well as the networks that connect them. We analyze the issues involved in using multicast in the Web, especially those related to routing and addressing. We also discuss the design and implementation of a system based on the existing WWW client and server architecture and the multicast support provided within IP.

Measurement of our BDIS implementation showed significant improvement in the number of clients that a server can support for the same level of quality of service. <p> Note that each request in the queue for a hot page may represent multiple clients waiting for a response. Our implementation maintains a list of the clients associated with each hot request. This queueing discipline has been analyzed in <ref> [3] </ref>. When a request arrives at the front of the queue and is ready for service the server checks to see if this request is eligible for a multicast response.

Reference-contexts: A variation of the DVMRP scheme allows for more efficient routing by pruning the parts of the network that should not receive packets destined to particular multicast addresses. Other proposed multicast routing protocols for the Internet include Core Based Trees <ref> [4] </ref> and Protocol Independent Multicasting (PIM) [11]. These protocols promise more bandwidth-efficient multicast routing.

Reference-contexts: Web clients typically support several different protocols or access methods for communicating with servers. The most common access method for current web resources is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <ref> [5] </ref>. In our work we only consider resources accessed using HTTP. HTTP is a connection-oriented transaction protocol for accessing and manipulating documents in hypertext as well as other formats. HTTP is designed to utilize a reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol (TCP) for the transfer of infor 3 mation between Web systems.

Reference-contexts: In the Web, typical requests include the access or update of files on a server host or the execution of a program. By far the most predominant access request is for the read-only retrieval of Web pages. Web resources are identified by their Universal Resource Locators (URLs) <ref> [6] </ref> which identify a server and a path to the file, or page, representing the resource being requested. Web clients typically support several different protocols or access methods for communicating with servers. The most common access method for current web resources is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [5]. <p> The Page Address field is a number from 0-255 that is assigned based on the pathname of the page being accessed. This pathname is equivalent to the url-path portion of the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) used to access this page <ref> [6] </ref>. This character string is hashed into an eight bit number to generate the address. In our current implementation we use a simple additive hash function that calculates the sum of the ASCII values modulo eight. This scheme reserves 256 addresses to each of 256 different servers.

Reference-contexts: For this we use a protocol that we developed in our group [24]. This protocol is, in turn, built around the IP multicast capabilities supported in the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBONE) <ref> [7] </ref>. In such an environment, the multicast group formed by the clients requesting the same page needs to be identified by a single multicast IP address and all the clients need to explicitly join that group. We discuss how this is accomplished shortly.

Reference-contexts: There is significant ongoing research related to the performance of WWW systems. The most popular approach to addressing the server load problem is to introduce replicated caching servers at the most popular Web sites. Claffy and Braun have analyzed the benefits of caching in the Mosaic server at NCSA <ref> [8] </ref>. Padmanabhan and Mogul have proposed mechanisms to reduce the latency associated with HTTP communications by removing the overhead of creating a new connection for every HTTP request [20]. Sedayao studied the Mosaic related traffic on a large corporate network and presented several issues to consider when deploying Mosaic [23]. <p> We have observed similar skewed request patterns on two other popular servers located on the Georgia Tech network. Similarly, Claffy and Braun describe results showing that the top 25 documents (.27%) on the NCSA Mosaic server account for 59% of the document requests <ref> [8] </ref>. A closer inspection of the top 100 requests for this server reveals that all but four 5 were simple HTTP GET requests to retrieve a file 1 .

Reference-contexts: In order to minimize bandwidth cost it is important that the multicast traffic is only delivered to networks that have interested clients. A multicast routing protocol proposed for the Internet and in use in the MBONE is a variation of reverse path forwarding <ref> [9] </ref> known as the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [12, 21]. In its simplest version this protocol would broadcast all multicast messages and rely on end routers to discard packets if they know of no end-users that should receive them. Clearly, this form of multicast is wasteful of bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: This step should also involve notifying the local router of the requested group membership. For example, the client could send an IGMP Host-Report message to the router <ref> [10] </ref>. 3. Send query to server: The client sends the request to the server. This is done using the current connection request model of HTTP. Along with the request message the client sends an indication that it will support a multicast response for this query. 4.

These protocols promise more bandwidth-efficient multicast routing. Time to Join: Another issue to consider with multicast routing protocols is the time lag between the point where a host requests to join a group and the point where it is able to receive messages sent to the group.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The number of World-Wide Web users in the Internet has grown dramatically in recent months. During the period from September to October, 1994, the amount of WWW traffic on the NSFNET grew by thirty-one percent <ref> [18] </ref>. With this increased popularity has come a significant increase in the demand placed on popular Web servers. This increased demand has caused noticeable increases in response time experienced by users. There is significant ongoing research related to the performance of WWW systems.

Reference-contexts: In the same way that an HTTP connection is built on top of a TCP connection, the multicast response connection needs to be built on top of a reliable multicast transport protocol. For this we use a protocol that we developed in our group <ref> [24] </ref>. This protocol is, in turn, built around the IP multicast capabilities supported in the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBONE) [7]. <p> This new connection is established by creating a new socket and then calling the connect () system call. The reliable multicast protocol is our working prototype of the Single Connection Emulation (SCE) architecture described in <ref> [24] </ref>. 12 5.3 Interaction with Multicast Routing Bandwidth Consumption: By multicasting responses we are able to satisfy multiple client requests with a single transmission from the server. This clearly saves on server resources and allows it to handle a heavier request load. <p> As always, clients will be able to resend a request and ask for a unicast reply in the event that multicast replies are not reaching them. 5.4 Multicast Connection Semantics Our multicast response is based on the use of a connection-oriented multicast transport protocol that we developed <ref> [24] </ref>. For such a protocol it may not always be necessary or even appropriate for all group members to be active for the entire duration of a connection. There are situations where it makes sense to allow participants to join the connection late or to leave early. <p> Our implementation is being developed on the Sun OS release 3.1.U1 operating system for Sun Sparc systems. These systems have been modified to support IP multicast and the multicast transport protocol described in <ref> [24] </ref>. This transport protocol provides a reliable point-to-multipoint implementation of the TCP protocol. We have made significant modifications to the HTTP server code to implement the request queue architecture depicted in Figure 3.
