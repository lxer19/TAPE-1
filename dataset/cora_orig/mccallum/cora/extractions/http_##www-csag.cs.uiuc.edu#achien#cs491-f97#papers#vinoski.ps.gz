Reference-contexts: These services complement those specified in the existing OMG Common Object Services Lifecycle Specification <ref> [4] </ref>. * ORBOS: Objects by value - CORBA currently allows object references to be passed as arguments and return values, but it does not allow objects to be passed by value. This makes the use of encapsulated data types (e.g., linked lists) difficult to use from languages such as C++.

Reference-contexts: As described by the Adapter pattern <ref> [10] </ref>, an object adapter is an object that adapts the interface of another object to the interface expected by a caller.

Reference-contexts: This in turn has resulted in nontrivial portability problems between BOA implementations because each ORB vendor has filled in the missing pieces with proprietary solutions. Fortunately, the OMG has recognized this problem and is currently actively working to solve it. It recently issued a Portability Enhancement RFP <ref> [14] </ref> that will result in the adoption of specifications for standard portable object adapters.
Reference: [15] <author> W. Rosenberry, D. Kenney, and G. Fischer, </author> <title> Understanding DCE. </title> <publisher> O'Reilly and Associates, Inc., </publisher> <year> 1992. </year>
Reference-contexts: The ORB interoperability architecture also provides for other environment-specific inter-ORB protocols (ESIOPs). ESIOPs allow ORBs to be built for special situations in which certain distributed computing infrastructures are already in use. The first ESIOP, which utilizes the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) <ref> [15] </ref>, is called the DCE Common Inter-ORB Protocol (DCE-CIOP). It can be used by ORBs in environments where DCE is already installed. This allows the ORB to leverage existing DCE functions, and it allows for easier integration of CORBA and DCE applications.

Reference-contexts: Most commercially-available ORB products already support IIOP and IORs and have been tested to ensure interoperability. Interoperability testing is currently done directly between ORB vendors rather than by an independent conformance-testing body. One interesting exception to this rule is an interoperability testbed called CORBAnet <ref> [16] </ref>, which was established by the OMG to help facilitate ORB interoperability testing and prove commercial viability. CORBAnet is an interactive meeting room booking system implemented over a number of interoperating commercial ORB products on a variety of hardware platforms.

Reference-contexts: The CORBAtel Telecommunications Task Force recently issued an RFP <ref> [17] </ref> seeking technology for the management and manipulation of isochronous streams. * Business: Business Objects Portions of many business processes are very similar, and thus can be abstracted out into frameworks.
Reference: [18] <institution> Object Management Group, Common Business Objects and Business Object Facility RFP, OMG Document cf/96-01-04 ed., </institution> <month> January </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: The Business Objects Task Force will soon begin evaluating responses to its Business Objects RFP <ref> [18] </ref>, which seeks object frameworks to support business processes. * Common Facilities: Systems Management Facility The OMG has nearly completed the adoption of the X/Open systems management specification [19], which defines a set of extended services for the monitoring and management of distributed systems.

Reference-contexts: This makes the use of encapsulated data types (e.g., linked lists) difficult to use from languages such as C++. The ORBOS Task Force will soon begin evaluating responses to its Objects By Value RFP <ref> [20] </ref>, which will describe technology for passing objects by value between CORBA applications. Another special area of interest of the ORBOS Task Force is providing specifications that allow for the bidirectional interoperation of Microsoft COM and Distributed COM (DCOM) applications with CORBA applications.

Reference-contexts: Of particular importance to the OMG community is a recent press release by Netscape Corporation stating that they will build IIOP and an ORB into future releases of their products, including their Navigator web browser software <ref> [21] </ref>. They intend to allow remote CORBA objects and services to appear as browser plug-ins, using IIOP to forward requests to them. Because of the popularity of Netscape Navigator, this decision effectively brings CORBA to 40 million desktops around the world.
