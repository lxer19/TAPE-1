Abstract: In this paper we present an end to end rate control algorithm for multicast (point to multipoint) ABR service in ATM networks. The algorithm is the multicast extension of the SP-EPRCA unicast (point-to-point) congestion control algorithm proposed in [1]. The goal is to control the multicast input rate in order to achieve high bandwidth utilization without overflowing any queue along the multicast tree. The straightforward approach would be to consider a multicast connection as a superposition of unicast connections, and to compute the multicast input rate as the minimum among all unicast input rates. The main problem is the congestion caused by feedback traffic from the multiple destinations. To solve this problem, we show how feedback information cells can be intelligently "merged" at each multicast tree "fork" without losing essential information needed by the control algorithm placed at the source. The algorithm proposed inherits all properties from the unicast SP-EPRCA.

Reference-contexts: algorithm updates the rate using the unicast SP-EPRCA controller corresponding to the destination D i from which the cell comes from. 2- Upon expiration of the feedback interarrival time 4 , the source uses the last RM cell received and the corresponding unicast SP-EPRCA algorithm to perform a virtual feedback <ref> [1] </ref>. Theorem 1 The SP-MRCA algorithm is equivalent to the IMRCA algorithm. We have to show that the two algorithms compute always the same rate. Since the proof is rather intuitive, for sake of brevity we give only a sketch of it. <p> We divide the proof in two cases: i) t &lt; RT D max : During this interval, the connection with longest RTD does not receive feedback information, and 2 We assume a RT D max large enough such that virtual feedback is needed, since the other case is trivial (see <ref> [1] </ref>) thus uses virtual feedback for its rate computation, say u v .

Reference-contexts: To reduce implementation cost, without giving up bandwidth utilization, smaller buffers than the strictly required for large delays may be used, thus incurring some cell loss. In this case, Host re-transmissions using schemes such as the one reported in <ref> [2] </ref> must be used. Work is in progress to determine the tradeoffs between buffer costs and Host retransmission overhead and latency.

Reference-contexts: The trade-offs between buffer sizes and throughput are the same as in the SP-EPRCA, and thus were not addressed here. Although we have assumed individual queues per VCs at each switch output port, work is in progress to provide single buffer per output port, as reported in <ref> [3] </ref> for unicast connections. As for the implementation of the Smith Predictor controller at the source, this can be placed either in the Host or in the edge switch. The latter implementation is preferred since it complies with the ATM Forum UNI specifications.
