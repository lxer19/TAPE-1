Title: Combinatorial Optimization through Multiresolution Analysis  
Author: James D. Fix 
Abstract: Recently, multiresolution analysis and wavelets have had a great impact on computer algorithm design, chiefly in the areas of signal processing and compression, computer graphics, and numeric optimization algorithms. Of the algorithms that have benefitted, Meyers mul-tiresolution polygon tiling algorithm is unique in that it solves a combinatorial optimization problem. This paper suggests a generalization of Meyers' methodology by proposing an algorithm framework called multiresolution optimization. The idea behind multiresolution optimization is simple: simplify a problem instance by constructing a lower resolution version, solve the optimization problem on this simpler version, and use the solution of the simpler instance to construct a solution to the original problem instance. We discuss the potential benefits of multiresolution algorithms, and the issues involved in their design.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, Daubechies family was complete| no other orthogonal bases with finite support exist. The more general biorthogonal Multiresolution Optimization 6 wavelets we've described above, formalized by Cohen, Daubechies, and Feauveau <ref> [1] </ref>, have their origin in subband coding theory, where a fair number of finite analysis and sequence filters are known. <p> Note that the dual scaling function also changes to maintain biorthogonality. In the linear interpolation example, primal lifting by preserving the average results in a new wavelet with vanishing integral. The resulting wavelet is the (2; 2) biorthogonal wavelet of Cohen, Daubechies, and Feauveau <ref> [1] </ref>. The wavelet used by Meyers (see section 5.2) can be seen as another form of primal lifting, where the operator L is defined so that the lifted wavelet is nearly orthogonal to the scaling functions.

Reference-contexts: For numeric optimization problems, wavelet decompositions provide a hierarchical basis for encoding the problem instances and the problem solution. In the latter case, a numeric method can solve the problem quickly by providing a coarse solution, then refine the solution at the higher resolutions <ref> [2] </ref>. Computer graphics algorithms have benefitted as well (see [23], for example), not only because many graphics applications include compression and numeric methods, but in other applications as well.

Reference-contexts: Few orthonormal wavelets with finite filters were known initially, until Daubechies demonstrated a family of orthonormal wavelet bases with finite support whose smoothness varied with the size of the filters <ref> [3] </ref>. Unfortunately, Daubechies family was complete| no other orthogonal bases with finite support exist. <p> Daubechies defined her orthonormal scaling functions and wavelets as the limit of such a procedure <ref> [3] </ref>. The key intuition of Lounsbery et al. was that recursive subdivision can be used to construct a multiresolution analysis. In essence, the subdivision scheme defines a set of scaling functions and a nested set of subspaces. Donoho, for example, demonstrated wavelets based on interpolating subdivision [6].

Reference-contexts: Very recently, Daubechies and Sweldens demonstrated that this is true: any biorthogonal wavelet transform with finite filters can be factored into a series of dual and primal lifting steps, though the number of such steps could be proportional to the size of the filters <ref> [4] </ref>. 8 Designing a Local Search Refinement Strategy In our proposal for multiresolution optimization, we require a local search strategy for refining solutions that have been constructed from lower resolution problem instances.

Reference-contexts: Suppose we have evenly spaced samples from a function f and we wish to infer the intermediate values of f between the samples. Let c 0 = fc 0 k = f (k)g. To do so, we will use the interpolating subdivision scheme of Deslauries and Dubuc <ref> [5] </ref> that reconstructs polynomials of degree 2m 1. For all j 0, k 2 Z, define x j k = 2 j k and let c j be the inferred function values at the j-th step. Our hope is that the c j k approximate f (x j k ).

Reference-contexts: The key intuition of Lounsbery et al. was that recursive subdivision can be used to construct a multiresolution analysis. In essence, the subdivision scheme defines a set of scaling functions and a nested set of subspaces. Donoho, for example, demonstrated wavelets based on interpolating subdivision <ref> [6] </ref>. Since subdivision schemes exist for functions over bounded intervals, curves, and surfaces, wavelets derived from subdivision can be applied in a second generation wavelet setting. Their construction does not rely on fourier techniques. 7.2 Lifting We have yet to demonstrate how wavelets can be constructed from subdivision.

Reference-contexts: For example, when editing a curve one can change the overall sweep of a curve by changing the influence of lower resolution wavelets, or add sharp features to a curve by changing the influence of higher resolution wavelets <ref> [7] </ref>. Meyers used multiresolution analysis to perform surface reconstruction from planar contours [15]. Specifically, he used multiresolution techniques to devise an approximation algorithm for tiling a pair of parallel polygons. <p> Sweldens calls these second generation wavelets [26], suggesting the following examples: Function spaces on bounded domains. For many applications functions are defined on a bounded interval of the real line. For example, Finkelstein's multiresolution curve editor defines Multiresolution Optimization 15 wavelets for endpoint interpolating spline functions <ref> [7] </ref>. Functions over curves and surfaces. In computer graphics applications, for example, complicated multi-dimensional models are manipulated, defined as functions over spheres [22] and surfaces of arbitrary topology [13].

Reference-contexts: Meyers used multiresolution analysis to perform surface reconstruction from planar contours [15]. Specifically, he used multiresolution techniques to devise an approximation algorithm for tiling a pair of parallel polygons. The exact method of Fuchs, Kedem, and Uselton <ref> [8] </ref> used to solve this problem were too slow and too memory intensive for interactive applications. <p> The set of tiles constructed must satisfy the following properties <ref> [8] </ref>: (T1) Every face of each polygon is a side of exactly one tile. (T2) Every cross edge is a side of exactly two tiles. a weight to each tile, and define a weight function for a tiling as the sum of the weights of the tiles in the tiling. <p> For example, in Fuchs et al <ref> [8] </ref>, the tile weight function was simply the surface area of the tile, and the goal was to find a tiling of minimum surface area. This problem can be posed as an equivalent graph problem to reveal the underlying combinatorial problem.

Reference-contexts: the local search progresses and most of the edges of the solution are near optimal, LKNeighbor checks fewer edge exchanges. 8.2 A Formal Framework for Local Search Heuristics Before devising the L-K heuristic for the TSP, Kernighan and Lin had formulated a similar heuristic for the graph partitioning (GP) problem <ref> [9] </ref>. Their GP heuristic involved following a sequence of vertex exchanges analogous to the edge exchanges of L-K for the TSP. The features of their heuristic Multiresolution Optimization 20 for GP guided them in their development of L-K for the TSP.

Reference-contexts: The resulting algorithm is essentially the multiresolution tiling algorithm of Meyers [15]. 5.1 Polygon Tiling A typical subproblem of many surface reconstruction algorithms is the fitting of a surface to two parallel contours. Keppel <ref> [10] </ref> solved this problem by modeling the contours as piecewise linear curves, that is, as polygons, and reduced the problem to that of constructing a triangulation between the two polygons.

Reference-contexts: Larger neighborhoods can lead to effective searches, exploring more of the solution space at the potential expense of more work per neighborhood improvement step. In an empirical study of the k-change neighborhood for TSP, Lin <ref> [11] </ref> found that the chances of finding an optimal tour increased significantly from k = 2 to k = 3, but improvement diminished with k = 4.

Given an instance (P; Q) of the polygon tiling problem where jP j = m = 2 j jQj = n = 2 k and define resoln (P; Q) = j. <p> For example, Finkelstein's multiresolution curve editor defines Multiresolution Optimization 15 wavelets for endpoint interpolating spline functions [7]. Functions over curves and surfaces. In computer graphics applications, for example, complicated multi-dimensional models are manipulated, defined as functions over spheres [22] and surfaces of arbitrary topology <ref> [13] </ref>. In each of these cases, the scaling functions and wavelets cannot be based on translates and dilates of a single function, thus fourier techniques cannot be easily applied. <p> of second generation wavelets requires techniques more suitable for these domains, one of which is the use of recursive subdivision to construct functions. 7.1 Subdivision Lounsbery, DeRose, and Warren devised a multiresolution analysis on closed continuous surfaces whose scaling functions and wavelets varied depending on their location on the surface <ref> [13] </ref>. The fact that they were using subdivision surfaces was crucial to their construction. We will not define subdivision surfaces here, but rather illustrate their construction with a one-dimensional analogue: interpolating subdivision for functions over the real line.

Reference-contexts: If and have finite support, then the lower resolution wavelets encode details over wider intervals and higher resolution wavelets encode details over narrower intervals. Our notation for the synthesis and analysis filters is not arbitrary. It can be observed <ref> [27] </ref> that the scaling function is directly related to the synthesis filter h, in the sense that changing one changes the other. Respectively, the functions ~ , , and ~ are related to ~ h, g, and ~ h in a similar fashion. <p> In the interpolation subdivision scheme of section 7.1, polynomial fitting is used to try and predict the value of f at intermediate points. To modify the interpolation scheme to build a wavelet, Sweldens and Schroder note that the wavelet coefficients should encode the error of this prediction <ref> [27] </ref>. For example, the linear interpolation scheme can be modified to be an inverse transform: c 2k = c k j+1 j j j Thus, the wavelet coefficients d j k encode where the original function fails to be linear. <p> The Generality of Lifting In the above discussions, we give the examples from Sweldens and Schroder <ref> [27] </ref> that apply lifting to the lazy wavelet transform. In that same paper, they construct wavelets for the interpolating subdivision using polynomials of arbitrary degree whose low resolution approximations are guaranteed to preserve certain properties (for example, the average value or higher-order moments of a function).
