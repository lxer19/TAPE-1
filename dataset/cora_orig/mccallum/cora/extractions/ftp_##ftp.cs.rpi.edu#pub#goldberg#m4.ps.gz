Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A hypergraph is called bipartite <ref> [6] </ref> if its vertices can be colored in two colors so that no hyperedge is monochromatic. Erdos [7] defines a function m (n) to be the minimal number of hyperedges in an n-uniform non-bipartite hypergraph.

Erdos <ref> [7] </ref> defines a function m (n) to be the minimal number of hyperedges in an n-uniform non-bipartite hypergraph. It is easy to see that m (2) = 3 and the corresponding hypergraph is a triangle.

Reference-contexts: Let G be an n-uniform hypergraph on v vertices. Since there are 2 v1 different 2-colorings of V (G) and every hyperedge is monochromatic under 2 vn of them, a non-bipartite hypergraph G must have at least 2 v =2 vn = 2 n1 hyperedges. Thus, (see <ref> [9] </ref>) m (n) 2 n1 . It turns out (see [9]) and ([15]) that a better lower bound can be obtained by using balanced 2-colorings, for which the color classes represent a partition of V (G) into sets of equal size (within one element). <p> Since there are 2 v1 different 2-colorings of V (G) and every hyperedge is monochromatic under 2 vn of them, a non-bipartite hypergraph G must have at least 2 v =2 vn = 2 n1 hyperedges.
