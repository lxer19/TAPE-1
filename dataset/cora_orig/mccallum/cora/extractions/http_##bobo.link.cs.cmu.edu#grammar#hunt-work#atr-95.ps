Abstract: This paper presents results from work on two prosodic recognition models which are capable of resolving syntactic ambiguities using acoustic features measured from the speech signal. The models are based on multivariate statistical techniques that identify a linear relationship between sets of acoustic and syntactic features. They are able to learn an intermediate (phonological) representation which is appropriate for the acoustic and syntactic feature sets. This provides both practical and theoretical advantages; in particular, no hand-labelled prosodic data is required for training. The recognition models achieve accuracies of up to 75% when resolving the syntactic ambiguities of the ambiguous sentence corpus and have a number of linguistically interesting characteristics.

Reference-contexts: Results are presented for two models which are capable of using acoustic prosodic features of the speech signal to resolve syntactic ambiguities. These models, the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) model and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model, differ from comparable previous work (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>) in two important ways. Firstly, they use the syntactic analysis of the link grammar. Secondly, they are based on multivariate statistical techniques which are capable of learning an intermediate representation between the acoustic and syntactic domains. intermediate representation (such as used in [1]). <p> model, differ from comparable previous work (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>) in two important ways. Firstly, they use the syntactic analysis of the link grammar. Secondly, they are based on multivariate statistical techniques which are capable of learning an intermediate representation between the acoustic and syntactic domains. intermediate representation (such as used in [1]). With this approach, two separate models are used to predict the intermediate representation of break indices (or a stochastic representation of break indices) from the acoustic and syntactic domains. The correspondence of these predictions is used as a recognition score. <p> Speech Data and Analysis 2.1 Speech Data The current work used two professional read speech corpora for training and testing the prosody-syntax models; the radio news speech corpus [5] and the ambiguous sentence corpus [6]. The radio news speech corpus has been used previously for training prosody-syntax recognition models <ref> [1] </ref>, [5], [7]. For the current work, five news stories from a single female speaker were used, providing data on 1491 sentence-internal word boundaries. The ambiguous sentence corpus was developed to test the ability of human subjects to resolve syntactic ambiguities using prosodic cues [6]. <p> The ambiguous sentence corpus was developed to test the ability of human subjects to resolve syntactic ambiguities using prosodic cues [6]. It has since been used to evaluate the capability of prosody-syntax recognition models <ref> [1] </ref>, [5], [7]. It contains 35 pairs of structurally ambiguous sentences each read by four speakers (3 female, 1 male), and so consists of a total of 280 utterances. Due to parsing problems six sentence pairs were unavailable for the recognition tests. <p> This accuracy is significantly above chance level (50%; p &lt; 0.001), slightly better than the best previous comparable system (73% <ref> [1] </ref>), but is significantly below human capabilities at the same task (84%, [6]). The accuracy was consistent across speakers and syntactic forms. * A CCA recognition model trained on the radio news speech corpus and tested on the ambiguous sentence corpus obtained 72% accuracy.

Detailed descriptions of the CCA and LDA models have been presented previously [2], <ref> [3] </ref>, [4]. <p> Moreover, an unsupervised prosody-syntax model can find a more effective intermediate representation. I propose that this is evidence that using a pre-determined, linguistically-motivated, intermediate representation can restrict the performance of a prosodic recognition model. 4.

Reference-contexts: This unsupervised learning of the intermediate representation provides several theoretical and practical advantages, which are discussed later in the paper. Detailed descriptions of the CCA and LDA models have been presented previously [2], [3], <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> A theory of syntactic influence on prosodic phrasing using the syntactic framework of the link grammar has been presented previously <ref> [4] </ref>. The theory makes three predictions: (1) that each surface syntactic relation will have an intrinsic prosodic coupling strength, (2) that longer links will have weakened prosodic coupling strength, and (3) that increasing the syntactic coupling of a word to its left will decrease its prosodic coupling to the right. <p> This relationship between acoustics and syntax applies across a wide range of syntactic forms and across a wide range of prosodic boundaries, from clitic boundaries to major phrase boundaries. These correlations exceeded those obtained by a comparable model which explicitly used break indices as an intermediate representation <ref> [4] </ref>; 0.64 and 0.72 for the two corpora. Criterion 3: Do the internal characteristics of the CCA model match expectations? It is of theoretical interest to know whether a model with unsupervised training of its intermediate representation can learn characteristics which match expectations from previous research on the prosody-syntax relationship. <p> The following are some of the relevant results. * The learned intermediate representations were significantly correlated with break indices; up to 0.66 and 0.83 for the two corpora. These correlations are only 11% and 2% below the maximum obtainable correlations for the feature sets <ref> [4] </ref>. * The roles of the acoustic features in the models were in agreement with previous research. In particular, the pause and rhyme durations were the most important of the acoustic features. * The roles of the syntactic features were in agreement with theoretical predictions.

Reference-contexts: The first three were measures of the vowel, rhyme and pause durations at each word boundary. Previous work has shown that these features are correlated with break indices <ref> [8] </ref> and with the presence of major syntactic boundaries. The remaining eight features were designed to compensate for non-syntactic effects upon the three durational features. These features included lexical stress, intensity measurements, segmental identity and characteristics of syllabic structure.

Reference-contexts: These features included lexical stress, intensity measurements, segmental identity and characteristics of syllabic structure. All eleven features were extracted automatically from the speech signal using phoneme and word segmentations provided by an automatic lexical recognition system. 2.2 Syntactic Feature Set The Link Grammar <ref> [9] </ref> provided the syntactic framework for modelling prosodic phrasing. The link grammar identifies links between syntactically related words. These links are presented in a link diagram. Each link has an associated link label which indicates a surface-syntactic relation (in the terminology of a dependency grammar).

Reference-contexts: These results support the same conclusions as presented above for the CCA model. 5. Discussion The two models presented in this paper conform to the methodology proposed by Ostendorf et al. <ref> [10] </ref>; the CCA and LDA models use linguistically established acoustic features and statistical training from a speech corpus. The use of statistical modelling techniques is effective for learning the characteristics of real speech data, and avoids the under-specification of prosodic effects that can occur if expert-style rules are used.
