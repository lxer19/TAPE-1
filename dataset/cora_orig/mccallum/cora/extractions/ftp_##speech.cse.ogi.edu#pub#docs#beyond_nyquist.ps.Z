Abstract: A new technique is presented which improves the subjective quality of band-limited speech. The approach is based on a linear model of speech production, in which we independently estimate the spectral envelope and excitation function for a broad-bandwidth speech signal to reconstruct missing frequency components in narrow-bandwidth speech.

Reference-contexts: However, we previously demonstrated that by taking advantage of the correlation between low and high frequency components in the short-term power spectrum of speech from a given speaker, high frequency recovery appears to be viable <ref> [1] </ref>. In that study, an attempt was made to predict each frequency component in the 4-8kHz range by mapping time trajectories of the cubic-root compressed short-term power spectrum of a 4kHz band-limited speech signal.

Reference-contexts: During synthesis, energy matching between the original signal and the synthetic signal is accomplished by scaling the excitation in a similar way as described in <ref> [3] </ref>. The resulting synthetic signal ^s (n 2 ) is filtered and mixed properly with s (n 1 ) to produce the recovered broad-band speech. 3.1.

Reference-contexts: The excitation e (n 2 ) for the high frequency band reconstruction is generated by up-sampling by two and whitening the residual signal r (n 1 ) at each frame <ref> [4] </ref>. The residual results from filtering s (n 1 ) with the inverse filter whose impulse response is given by a (k). <p> Frames with high energy in the high frequency band are generally fricatives and the fine structure has little or no harmonic structure at all. We tried other techniques for higher harmonics re generation (see also <ref> [4] </ref>), but the method described above has given the best results to date. 3.3.

Reference-contexts: Thus, this excitation signal is used to provide excitation at the low frequencies. For the coding method mentioned above, we used a stochastic codebook with 512 vectors, an adaptive codebook (see <ref> [5] </ref>) which allowed for pitch lags from 40 to 140 samples (no fractions), and a gain term for line) envelopes for the high frequency band. each codebook. All optimum parameters are calculated twice per frame.
