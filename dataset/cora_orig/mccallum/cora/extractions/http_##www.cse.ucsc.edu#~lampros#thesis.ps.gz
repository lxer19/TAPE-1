Reference-contexts: The CBR (Constant-Bit-Rate) and VBR (Variable-Bit-Rate) classes are intended to support applications with real-time service requirements. Applications that belong to these classes have strict requirements for bandwidth, end-to-end delay, jitter and cell loss-rate. The feasibility of supporting the specified requirements is expected to be controlled by an admission-control policy <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The applications will first declare their requirements to the network elements. The network elements in return will check if the service required can be guaranteed. If this is the case the corresponding connection will be accepted otherwise the connection will be rejected.

Reference-contexts: The interesting fact about congestion is that it cannont be eliminated even if more resources like link capacity, memory, or faster CPUs were made available <ref> [9] </ref>. The problem becomes even more challenging if we consider the mismatch in the link capacities in current internetworks that spans from kilobits/sec, (e.g., SLIP connections), to gigabit/sec connections. TCP has been designed to operate in networks with no congestion control mechanisms below the transport layer [10].

Reference-contexts: The problem becomes even more challenging if we consider the mismatch in the link capacities in current internetworks that spans from kilobits/sec, (e.g., SLIP connections), to gigabit/sec connections. TCP has been designed to operate in networks with no congestion control mechanisms below the transport layer <ref> [10] </ref>. It has built-in mechanisms for protection against congestion. Its behavior in datagram network has been studied extensively [11, 12, 13]. <p> Many of these ideas have also been applied and tested in real network environments. For example DECNET uses the scheme proposed by Ramakrishnan and Jain [20] and internetworks based on the TCP/IP protocol suite use the congestion control schemes proposed by Jacobson <ref> [10] </ref>. The proposed approaches can be classified based on where control is enforced. We consider three categories: i. Source-based schemes. ii. Gateway-based schemes iii. Combined schemes In source-based schemes, either one or both the end-hosts control the connection's flow. Example of such schemes is the TCP protocol. <p> TCP keeps an estimate of the actual RTT time by measuring the RTT time of specific packets and then computing the exponentially-smoothed average value of the obtained samples. The average RTT value is called smoothed RTT. Jacobson <ref> [10] </ref> suggests that the timeout interval RTO shall be computed based on both the mean and the variance of the RTT value. <p> Since the mean deviation is a good approximation to the standard deviation, the RTO is computed as: RT O = smoothed RTT + 4D where D is an estimate of the mean deviation. Jacobson <ref> [10] </ref> also describes how the above procedure can be computed efficiently by using only add and shift operations. The loss of a packet may also be indicated by the receipt of duplicate acknowledgement. In TCP all transmitted packets carry a sequence number. <p> Before congestion control mechanisms were introduced in TCP, the size of the window was set based on the amount of buffer available at the receiving host. Its purpose was to control buffer overflow at the receiving end. In order to control congestion, Jacobson <ref> [10] </ref> proposed the use of another window called congestion window. The amount of outstanding data was defined to be the minimum of the congestion window and the window advertised by the receiver. Congestion control and avoidance in TCP is performed by dynamically adjusting the size of the congestion window.

Reference-contexts: Without ATM-layer congestion control, the performance of TCP over ATM can be considerably worse as compared to its performance in datagram networks in certain network configurations as has been reported in <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. Since each TCP segment is fragmented into a large number of cells in the ATM network, the loss of a single cell triggers the retransmission of an entire TCP segment. <p> The performance of TCP over ATM networks without any flow control mechanism can be very poor <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. This performance degradation is caused by the fragmentation of the TCP segments to a large number of ATM cells. The loss of single cell will eventually trigger the retransmission of the corrupted segment. However, cells belonging to the original segment are still transmitted thus wasting valuable network resources. <p> The loss of single cell will eventually trigger the retransmission of the corrupted segment. However, cells belonging to the original segment are still transmitted thus wasting valuable network resources. Two packet discard approaches have been proposed <ref> [14] </ref>. The Partial Packet Discard policy simply discards all the cells following the dropped cell that belong to the corrupted segment. In this approach, however, the cells prior to the dropped one are still being transmitted towards the destination. An improvement over this scheme is the Early Packet Discard.

Reference-contexts: Without ATM-layer congestion control, the performance of TCP over ATM can be considerably worse as compared to its performance in datagram networks in certain network configurations as has been reported in <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. Since each TCP segment is fragmented into a large number of cells in the ATM network, the loss of a single cell triggers the retransmission of an entire TCP segment. <p> As it was mentioned earlier TCP is expected to be used to support these applications. But TCP without any support from the ATM layer will be like operating in "best-effort" mode <ref> [15] </ref>, thus being unable to efficiently support ABR applications which require guarantees for minimum bandwidth and implicit or explicit cell loss rate guarantees. <p> The performance of TCP over ATM networks without any flow control mechanism can be very poor <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. This performance degradation is caused by the fragmentation of the TCP segments to a large number of ATM cells. The loss of single cell will eventually trigger the retransmission of the corrupted segment. However, cells belonging to the original segment are still transmitted thus wasting valuable network resources. <p> Also, results reported in <ref> [15] </ref> showed that TCP adapts very well over ATM an network that is flow-controlled with the FCVC scheme. The N 23 scheme, however, has two drawbacks. Its memory requirements in a MAN or a WAN network can be prohibitively large.
