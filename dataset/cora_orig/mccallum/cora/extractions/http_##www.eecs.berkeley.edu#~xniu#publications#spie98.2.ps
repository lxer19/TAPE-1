Abstract: Submicron Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) photolithographic processes present significant manufacturing challenges due to the relatively small process windows often associated with these technologies. The sensitivity of the process to small upstream variations in incoming film reflectivity, photoresist coat and softbake steps as well as the bake plate temperature can result in the final critical dimension (CD) going out of specifications and more importantly, not being identified until the end of the lot. In this work, we have identified the pre-exposure film stack reflectance and the pre-develop exposed area photoresist thickness loss as wafer state quantities, related to the final photoresist critical dimension. A control model integrating equipment and wafer state parameters has been constructed, using a designed experiment, to facilitate control of the photolithography sequence. We have also installed a scanning head, broadband reflectance spectrometer as an in-situ sensor to measure the film stack reflectance for feed-forward corrections to the exposure dose, and to measure the resist thickness loss as a uniformity measure of the combined exposure and the post-exposure bake steps and hence of the final photoresist CD.

Reference-contexts: The solution to this dilemma is the introduction of self-measuring, self-adjusting processes. We have shown in the past with I-line lithography that this is possible, assuming that in-situ metrology exists to make the process observable <ref> [1] </ref>. So, in the context of this objective, we have focussed our control effort in pushing the observability of these new DUV technologies. High end devices such as microprocessors require a considerable number of process steps.

Reference-contexts: The need for in-situ and/or in-line process monitoring must however be balanced with critical manufacturing issues such as possible adverse effects on throughput, cost, sensor integration into an overall control strategy, possibly limited sensor reliability, etc. <ref> [2] </ref>. Most commercial metrology equipment is either too slow or too complex to be implemented in an in-line arrangement. An ideal in-line metrology sensor would be capable of making measurements that are sufficiently accurate, repeatable and rapid at a low cost.

Reference-contexts: For optical lithography in the DUV regions, substrate reflections are very severe and contribute standing wave effects. Inspite of partially coherent imaging, standing waves remains an issue. The ratio of the exposure in the constructive and destructive regions can be a factor of 8 <ref> [3] </ref>. The relative exposure of the resist in the maxima and the minima depends on the reflection coefficient seen by the wave in the resist material upon striking the substrate. This reflection coefficient depends on the refractive indices of the resist and the underlying thin film stack.

Reference-contexts: An example of a thin film stack in the lithography sequence is the gate stack (polysil-icon on gate oxide on silicon). The structure and optical properties of polysilicon depend very much on the deposition temperature, the dopant type and concentration and on the subsequent thermal cycling <ref> [4] </ref>. This causes large variability in the optical constants of the polysilicon layer and hence in the reflectance of the gate stack. This problem is overcome to a large extent by the use of anti-reflective coatings.

Reference-contexts: These hydroxyl groups are blocked by reacting the hydroxyl group with some longer chain molecule, resulting in a very slowly dissolving polymer. The blocked polymer undergoes acidolysis to generate the soluble hydroxyl group in the presence of acid and heat <ref> [5] </ref>. The cleaved sidechain is volatile and evaporates, causing film shrinkage in the exposed areas. The extent of this exposed photoresist thinning is dependent on the molecular weight of the blocking groups.

Reference-contexts: It is a quantitative measure of the state of the photoresist after the post exposure bake process and has been shown to be strongly correlated to the final photoresist critical dimension <ref> [6] </ref>. It has become common practice to employ Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for off-line quantification of the deprotection reaction.

Reference-contexts: A study was done to correlate the resist thinning in the exposed areas after the post-exposure bake process to the depro-tection of the resist using FTIR <ref> [7] </ref>. The resist thinning was measured in blanket areas since it is easier to measure than in patterned areas.The process inputs for this experiment were the exposure dose and the PEB temperature while the response variables were the amount of deprotection and the exposed area resist thickness loss.

Reference-contexts: The PEB temperature was varied from 120 degrees Celsius to 140 degrees Celsius in 10 degrees Celsius steps, thus requiring a total of 3 wafers. The deprotection was measured using both the hydroxy and the ester vibrational bands <ref> [8] </ref>. The thickness loss measured in the unexposed areas of the wafers was assumed to be due to solvent evaporation. This value was subtracted from all the thickness loss measurements of the corresponding wafer in the exposed sites.
