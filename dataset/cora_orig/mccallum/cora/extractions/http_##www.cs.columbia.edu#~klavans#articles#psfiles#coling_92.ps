Abstract: The automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge from large corpora has dealt primarily with coocurrence phenomena, at the expense of inherent lexical features. We present here a methodology for obtaining semantic information on verb aspect by parsing a corpus and automatically applying linguistic tests with a set of structural analysis tools. Once applied, we propose a representation for verb aspect that associates a value with weights for event types. Weights reflect typical verb use, and thus represent a measure of the resistance or ease of coercion in sentential context. The results we report here have been obtained in two ways: by extracting relevant information from the tagged Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982), and by running a parser (McCord 1980, 1990) on the Reader's Digest corpus to extract more accurate information on verb usage in text.

Reference-contexts: Verbs are gen-erally adaptable in context. 8 It is a known fact that values either for words with low frequencies or words in low frequency constructions must be computed on very large corpora <ref> (Liberman 1989.) </ref> The current limitations of this approach must be clearly stated. First of all, this method con-flates the polysemous usages of certain verbs and, in English, of the verb-particle construction.

Reference-contexts: Our claim is that, rather than the representation in Figure One, the event structure is a vector of values, e-type (Verb) = (S,P,T). We deal here only with the stative/non-stative distinction, since there are regular differences between states versus activities and accomplishments <ref> (Lakoff 1965) </ref>. We propose a simplified representation e-type (Verb)=V s (x) with a single value for stativity, V s , the non-stative value being merely the complement, i.e. V s + V : s = 1.

Reference-contexts: Parsing with English Slot Grammar The second more refined method utilizes a parser to analyze text, and to record verb usages. For this purpose, we used the English Slot Grammar <ref> (Mc-Cord 1980, 1990) </ref> a broad-coverage parser written in PROLOG. 7 To obtain counts of verb usages from the representations produced by ESG, we used a tool for querying trees (QT), built by the second author, also in PROLOG.
