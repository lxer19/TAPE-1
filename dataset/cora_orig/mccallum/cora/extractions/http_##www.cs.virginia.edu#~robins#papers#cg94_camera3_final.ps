Title: On the Maximum Degree of Minimum Spanning Trees  
Author: Gabriel Robins and Jeffrey S. Salowe 
Address: Charlottesville, VA 22903-2442  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia,  
Abstract: Motivated by practical VLSI routing applications, we study the maximum vertex degree of a minimum spanning tree (MST). We prove that under the L p norm, the maximum vertex degree over all MSTs is equal to the Hadwiger number of the corresponding unit ball; we show an even tighter bound for MSTs where the maximum degree is minimized. We give the best-known bounds for the maximum MST degree for arbitrary L p metrics in all dimensions, with a focus on the rectilinear metric in two and three dimensions. We show that for any finite set of points in the Man-hattan plane there exists an MST with maximum degree of at most 4, and for three-dimensional Manhat-tan space the maximum possible degree of a minimum-degree MST is either 13 or 14.

Reference-contexts: We relate the maximum MST degree under the L p metric to the so-called Hadwiger number of the corresponding L p unit ball. The relation between MST degree and the packing of convex sets has not been elucidated before, though Day and Edelsbrunner <ref> [5] </ref> studied the related "attractive power" of a point. For general dimension we give exponential lower bounds on the Hadwiger number and on the maximum MST degree. Our results have several practical applications.

Reference-contexts: Ho, Vijayan, and Wong [11], proved that an MST in the rectilinear plane must have maximum degree of D 8, and state (without proof) that the maximum degree bound may be improved to D 6. The results of Guibas and Stolfi <ref> [9] </ref> also imply the D 8 bound. In this paper we settle the bounded-degree MST problem in the rectilinear plane: we show that given a planar pointset, the rectilinear BDMST problem with D 3 is NP-hard, but that the rectilinear D 4 case is solvable in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we prove that in the rectilinear plane there always exists an MST with maximum degree of D 4, which is tight. We also analyze the maximum MST degree in three dimensions under the rectilinear metric, which arises in three-dimensional VLSI applications <ref> [10] </ref>, where we show a lower bound of 13 and an upper bound of 14 on the maximum MST degree (using the previously known techniques, the best obtainable lower and upper bounds for three dimensions under the rectilinear metric were 6 and 26, respectively). <p> Our results also have implications to newly emerging three-dimensional VLSI technologies <ref> [10] </ref>, as well as for any other algorithms that use an MST as the basis for some other construction. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 establishes the terminology and relates the maximum MST degree to the Hadwiger numbers (the central result is Theorem 4).
