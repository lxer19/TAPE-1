Title: A Versatile Packet Multiplexer for Quality-of-Service Networks

Abstract: A novel packet multiplexing technique, called Rotating-Priority-Queues (RPQ), is presented which exploits the tradeoff between high efficiency, i.e., the ability to support many connections with delay bounds, and low complexity. The operations required by the RPQ multiplexer are similar to those of the simple, but inefficient, Static-Priority (SP) multiplexer. The overhead of RPQ, as compared to SP, consists of a periodic rearrangement (rotation) of the priority queues. It is shown that queue rotations can be implemented by updating a set of pointers. The efficiency of RPQ can be made arbitrarily close to the highly efficient, yet complex, Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) multiplexer. Exact expressions for the worst case delays in an RPQ multiplexer are presented and compared to expressions for an EDF multiplexer.

Reference-contexts: In the following, we only consider a single multiplexer at an arbitrary network switch. Our results can be applied to routes which include multiple multiplexers by either considering the distortion of the packet stream at each multiplexer as in <ref> [3] </ref>, or by providing a holding mechanisms at each switch as shown in [15]. Next we provide a description of packet multiplexers for networks with a bounded delay service. In x2.1 we present a general traffic characterization for packet arrivals at a multiplexer.

If a violation occurs for a packet, it is moved to the FIFO queue with the correct laxity range. In another approach <ref> [11] </ref>, the movement of queued packets is avoided by periodically rearranging the order of the FIFO queues. However, the suggested implementation of this approach cannot guarantee the absence of deadline violations and therefore is not applicable in an implementation of a bounded delay service.

However, the suggested implementation of this approach cannot guarantee the absence of deadline violations and therefore is not applicable in an implementation of a bounded delay service. Similar to the approach suggested in [11], RPQ multiplexing approximates EDF by reordering FIFO queues after fixed time intervals without moving queued packets. However, RPQ multiplexing can guarantee that no packet exceeds a given delay bound. We discuss the operations of an RPQ multiplexer in the next subsection.

Reference-contexts: The traffic model is based on a variation of the leaky bucket traffic policing mechanism <ref> [12] </ref> and operates as follows. For each connection group j there exists a counter with maximum value b j . Each time the connection group sends a packet to the multiplexer, the counter is decremented by one. Packets cannot be sent to the multiplexer if the counter is zero.
