Abstract: This article presents a computational model of the learning of diagnostic knowledge based on observations of human operators engaged in a real-world troubleshooting task. We present a model of problem solving and learning in which the reasoner introspects about its own performance on the problem solving task, identifies what it needs to learn to improve its performance, formulates learning goals to acquire the required knowledge, and pursues its learning goals using multiple learning strategies. The model is implemented in a computer system which provides a case study based on observations of troubleshooting operators and protocol analysis of the data gathered in the test area of an operational electronics manufacturing plant. The model is intended as a computational model of human learning; in addition, it is computationally justified as a uniform, extensible framework for multistrategy learning. fl Technical Report GIT-CC-93/67, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332 0280, 1993.

Reference-contexts: The introspector compiles the heuristic knowledge into an association using a learning method similar to knowledge compilation <ref> [Anderson, 1989] </ref>. The motivation for this type of learning is performance gain through reduction of the number of intermediate steps when the system encounters a similar problem in the future, although use of this strategy also reinforces correct problem solving sequences.

Reference-contexts: In general, associative knowledge contributes to the quality and correctness of the solution for a large number of the problem solving situations. This was evident in our data from the electronics assembly plant, and has also been observed by other researchers (e.g., <ref> [Arabian, 1989] </ref>). Thus, an important type of learning is one in which the operator learns associations through experience. Human operators involved in troubleshooting also appear to learn some heuristic knowledge.

Reference-contexts: are made explicitly by the system rather than existing only in the minds of the system's designers. 5.3 Metacognition and learning Much of the meta-knowledge research in artificial intelligence has focused on knowledge about knowledge, or knowledge about the facts that one does or does not know (see, for example, <ref> [Barr, 1979; Davis, 1979; Davis and Buchanan, 1977] </ref>). Much of the metacognition research in psychology has also focussed on similar issues, focussing on cognitive processes and knowledge having the self as referent.

Reference-contexts: One form of introspection that has been implemented in many systems is the use of reasoning traces to represent problem solving performance; an early example of this approach was Sussman's [1975] HACKER program. Reasoning trace information has primarily been used for blame assignment (e.g., <ref> [Birnbaum, Collins, Freed, and Krulwich, 1990] </ref>) and for speedup learning (e.g., [Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli, 1986]).

Reference-contexts: induction of decision trees [Quinlan, 1986], conceptual clustering [Michalski and Stepp, 1983; Fisher, 1987]), analytical learning (e.g., explanation-based learning [DeJong and Mooney, 1986; Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli, 1986], learning from explanation failures [Hall, 1988; VanLehn, Jones, and Chi, 1992]), and analogical learning (e.g., analogy [Falkenhainer, 1989; Gentner, 1989], case-based learning <ref> [Carbonell, 1986; Hammond, 1989] </ref>). Recently, there has been much interest in multistrategy learning, and several approaches have been suggested (see, e.g., [Michalski and Tecuci, in press]). These approaches fall into four broad categories, which we call strategy selection models, toolbox models, cascade models, and single mechanism models. <p> The trace holds explicit information concerning the manner in which knowledge gaps are identified, the reasons why particular hypotheses are generated, the strategies chosen for verifying candidate hypotheses, and the basis for choosing particular reasoning methods for each of these. Trace Meta-XPs are similar to reasoning traces <ref> [Carbonell, 1986; Minton, 1988; Veloso and Carbonell, 1991] </ref> or justification structures [Birnbaum, Collins, Freed, and Krulwich, 1990; deKleer, Doyle, Steele, and Sussman, 1977; Doyle, 1979], with the difference that Trace Meta-XPs represent, in addition to the subgoal structure of the problem and justifications for operator selection decisions, information about the structure <p> To realize this ability, our model incorporates algorithms for learning and introspection, as well as representational methods using which a system can represent and reason about its meta-models. From the artificial intelligence point of view, our approach is similar to other approaches based on reasoning traces (e.g., <ref> [Carbonell, 1986; Minton, 1988] </ref>) or justification structures (e.g., [Birnbaum, Collins, Freed, and Krulwich, 1990; deKleer, Doyle, Steele, and Sussman, 1977; 41 Doyle, 1979]), and to other approaches that use characterizations of reasoning failures for blame assignment and/or multistrategy learning (e.g., [Mooney and Ourston, 1991; Park and Wilkins, 1990; Stroulia and Goel,

Many of the above reviews (e.g., <ref> [Chi, 1987; Schneider, 1985; Wellman, 1983] </ref>) cite evidence for such claims. Research in Meta-XP theory is a step in the direction in adding this metacognitive 44 monitoring capability to AI systems, but this is well beyond the capabilities of Meta-TS at present.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis of the system revealed that developing a model of the troubleshooting operator would provide a structure for designing and implementing computer-based tools for this task. The effort would also facilitate formalization of the task, which could then be used in the design of instructional systems <ref> [Clancey, 1986] </ref>, thereby facilitating the development of a flexible work force that is complementary to the policy of the company.

Reference-contexts: We developed a computational model of an operator involved in the task of troubleshooting a faulty PCB. The model was based on protocol analysis of over 300 problem solving episodes gathered in the ICT area of the NCR plant <ref> [Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>, and implemented in a computer system that performed the troubleshooting task. Of the data collected, one set was used in the development of the model and the remaining set was used to perform both behavioral validation and process validation of the computational model. <p> discuss the technical details of the computational model, including the problem solving system and the introspective multistrategy learning system that constitute the major components of the model. 2 The diagnostic problem solving module A schematic of the problem solving system, the troubleshooting module of Meta-TS, is shown in figure 2 <ref> [Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>. The module takes as input the ICT ticket information and the PCB information. The output of the module is a diagnosis and a set of recommended repair actions. <p> Based on our data from the human operators in the NCR plant, we categorized diagnostic knowledge into two broad types, associations and heuristics <ref> [Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>. Associations are simple rules which directly map a particular symptom to a specific diagnosis. The operator may perform an intermediate action to confirm the hypothesis, but usually does not perform a series of search sequences. <p> On 84% of these episodes, the model arrived at the same diagnostic result as an operator did in the real world for the same input information; and on 68% of the episodes, similar actions were performed in the solution process <ref> [Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>. <p> This article focusses on the learning module; further details of the problem solving module can be found in <ref> [Cohen, 1990; Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>. 3 The introspective multistrategy learning module Although the results from the standalone model of troubleshooting showed that the problem solving module was a reasonably good model of a skilled troubleshooting operator, there were also some obvious shortcomings.

Reference-contexts: NCR's manufacturing plant located near Atlanta has state-of-the-art facilities in electronics assembly manufacturing with a newly installed surface mount technology (SMT) line. Our project began when the plant became operational in January 1990 <ref> [Cohen, 1990] </ref>. At that time, the plant was facing typical start-up problems experienced by most new facilities. There were a high number of PCBs in the test and repair region waiting to undergo troubleshooting, resulting in high work-in-process inventories. <p> This article focusses on the learning module; further details of the problem solving module can be found in <ref> [Cohen, 1990; Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>. 3 The introspective multistrategy learning module Although the results from the standalone model of troubleshooting showed that the problem solving module was a reasonably good model of a skilled troubleshooting operator, there were also some obvious shortcomings. <p> We were interested both in comparing the results to the human data, as well as evaluating it as a machine learning system. We evaluated the system using 42 actual problem solving episodes gathered at the plant over a 2-month period <ref> [Cohen, 1990] </ref>. The problems dealt with various types of resistor failures and are representative of the types of problems encountered over the 2-month period. To evaluate the learning methods, we tested the following five conditions on the 42 test problems. * H (hand-coded): The original non-learning system with hand-coded associations.

Reference-contexts: Though diverging from the framework suggested by Chi, Meta-XP theory provides a robust form to represent knowledge about knowledge and process. For example, Meta-XPs can represent the difference between remembering and forgetting <ref> [Cox and Ram, 1992a] </ref>. Since forgetting is the absence of a successful outcome, this is difficult to capture in most frameworks. Forgetting is an important issue in machine learning [Markovitch and Scott, 1993] and in metamemory [Spear, 1978; Wellman and Johnson, 1979].

Reference-contexts: This strategy is triggered when the system arrives at an incorrect solution using heuristic and/or associative knowledge. The system attempts to acquire a correct associative knowledge from a skilled troubleshooter (the supervisor). This mechanism is similar to the interactive transfer of expertise in TEIRESIAS <ref> [Davis, 1979] </ref>. However, the knowledge learned in our system is not in the form of production rules, but in the form of frames and slots for association records. An example of the supervised learning of associations through experience is shown in figure 7. <p> are made explicitly by the system rather than existing only in the minds of the system's designers. 5.3 Metacognition and learning Much of the meta-knowledge research in artificial intelligence has focused on knowledge about knowledge, or knowledge about the facts that one does or does not know (see, for example, <ref> [Barr, 1979; Davis, 1979; Davis and Buchanan, 1977] </ref>).

Our observations revealed that operators rely predominantly on shallow reasoning methods using heuristic and context-sensitive associative knowledge during problem solving [Cohen, 1990; Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992; Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992].

These algorithms are tailored to particular problems including inductive learning (e.g., induction of decision trees [Quinlan, 1986], conceptual clustering <ref> [Michalski and Stepp, 1983; Fisher, 1987] </ref>), analytical learning (e.g., explanation-based learning [DeJong and Mooney, 1986; Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli, 1986], learning from explanation failures [Hall, 1988; VanLehn, Jones, and Chi, 1992]), and analogical learning (e.g., analogy [Falkenhainer, 1989; Gentner, 1989], case-based learning [Carbonell, 1986; Hammond, 1989]).

Reference-contexts: There are four important ways that metacognitive knowledge and capabilities bear on work in introspective learning. First, and foremost, is the emphasis on cognitive self-monitoring. This behavior is a human's ability to read their own mental states during cognitive processing <ref> [Flavell and Wellman, 1977; Wellman, 1983; Wellman, 1985] </ref>. Thus, there is a moment-by-moment understanding of the content of one's own mind, and thus an internal feedback for the cognition being performed and a judgement of progress (or lack thereof).

Reference-contexts: These algorithms are tailored to particular problems including inductive learning (e.g., induction of decision trees [Quinlan, 1986], conceptual clustering [Michalski and Stepp, 1983; Fisher, 1987]), analytical learning (e.g., explanation-based learning [DeJong and Mooney, 1986; Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli, 1986], learning from explanation failures <ref> [Hall, 1988; VanLehn, Jones, and Chi, 1992] </ref>), and analogical learning (e.g., analogy [Falkenhainer, 1989; Gentner, 1989], case-based learning [Carbonell, 1986; Hammond, 1989]). Recently, there has been much interest in multistrategy learning, and several approaches have been suggested (see, e.g., [Michalski and Tecuci, in press]).

Reference-contexts: induction of decision trees [Quinlan, 1986], conceptual clustering [Michalski and Stepp, 1983; Fisher, 1987]), analytical learning (e.g., explanation-based learning [DeJong and Mooney, 1986; Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli, 1986], learning from explanation failures [Hall, 1988; VanLehn, Jones, and Chi, 1992]), and analogical learning (e.g., analogy [Falkenhainer, 1989; Gentner, 1989], case-based learning <ref> [Carbonell, 1986; Hammond, 1989] </ref>).

These approaches fall into four broad categories, which we call strategy selection models, toolbox models, cascade models, and single mechanism models.

Reference-contexts: The underlying model is intended as a computational model of human learning; in addition, it is computationally justified as a uniform, extensible framework for multistrategy learning in machine learning systems. 1.1 The problem One of the critical areas in electronics assembly manufacturing is the test and repair area <ref> [Douglas, 1988; Kakani, 1987] </ref>. It is estimated that about 20% of manufactured printed-circuit boards (PCBs) 1 TS stands for TroubleShooter. 1 fail in the test area in a typical electronics assembly line.

Reference-contexts: Thus search and elaboration is pursued when an item is on the tip of the tongue and abandoned when unfamiliarity is judged. This provides an efficiency heuristic to control memory search and avoid the combinatoric explosion of inferences <ref> [Lachman, Lachman, and Thronesbery, 1979] </ref>. To be able to model this dimension of human metaknowledge might require a two-layered memory architecture. In the lower level would be the actual memories, cases and propositions. The second layer would be a metamemory which stores memories of the first layer.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, our approach provides a general framework for integrating multiple learning methods. The learning strategies are not dependent on the domain, but are however dependent on the types of knowledge used in the performance task. The Soar system <ref> [Laird, Rosenbloom, and Newell, 1986] </ref> takes a different approach to learning, which uses a single learning mechanism (chunking) rather than multiple learning strategies.

Reference-contexts: Recent research in diagnostic problem solving has proposed the use of deep reasoning methods [Richardson, Keller, Maxion, and Polson, 1985] or integration of deep and shallow reasoning methods in knowledge-based systems [Fink and Lusth, 1987] and in tutoring systems <ref> [Lesgold, Lajoie, Bunzo, and Eggan, 1988] </ref>. Our observations revealed that operators rely predominantly on shallow reasoning methods using heuristic and context-sensitive associative knowledge during problem solving [Cohen, 1990; Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992; Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992].

Reference-contexts: For example, Meta-XPs can represent the difference between remembering and forgetting [Cox and Ram, 1992a]. Since forgetting is the absence of a successful outcome, this is difficult to capture in most frameworks. Forgetting is an important issue in machine learning <ref> [Markovitch and Scott, 1993] </ref> and in metamemory [Spear, 1978; Wellman and Johnson, 1979].

Reference-contexts: A key to developing computer-based aids is understanding the human problem solving processes that carry out the complex task of troubleshooting in an assembly line situation. While there has been much interest in developing AI applications in various areas of electronics manufacturing (see, for example, <ref> [Miller and Walker, 1988] </ref>), most of this research has not dealt with the issues of learning or cognitive modelling. NCR's manufacturing plant located near Atlanta has state-of-the-art facilities in electronics assembly manufacturing with a newly installed surface mount technology (SMT) line.

Reference-contexts: The trace holds explicit information concerning the manner in which knowledge gaps are identified, the reasons why particular hypotheses are generated, the strategies chosen for verifying candidate hypotheses, and the basis for choosing particular reasoning methods for each of these. Trace Meta-XPs are similar to reasoning traces <ref> [Carbonell, 1986; Minton, 1988; Veloso and Carbonell, 1991] </ref> or justification structures [Birnbaum, Collins, Freed, and Krulwich, 1990; deKleer, Doyle, Steele, and Sussman, 1977; Doyle, 1979], with the difference that Trace Meta-XPs represent, in addition to the subgoal structure of the problem and justifications for operator selection decisions, information about the structure <p> To realize this ability, our model incorporates algorithms for learning and introspection, as well as representational methods using which a system can represent and reason about its meta-models. From the artificial intelligence point of view, our approach is similar to other approaches based on reasoning traces (e.g., <ref> [Carbonell, 1986; Minton, 1988] </ref>) or justification structures (e.g., [Birnbaum, Collins, Freed, and Krulwich, 1990; deKleer, Doyle, Steele, and Sussman, 1977; 41 Doyle, 1979]), and to other approaches that use characterizations of reasoning failures for blame assignment and/or multistrategy learning (e.g., [Mooney and Ourston, 1991; Park and Wilkins, 1990; Stroulia and Goel,

In addition, we propose that such information, suitably augmented with the kinds of knowledge represented in our Introspective Meta-XP structures, can be used as the basis for the selection of learning strategies in a multistrategy learning system.

Reference-contexts: discuss the technical details of the computational model, including the problem solving system and the introspective multistrategy learning system that constitute the major components of the model. 2 The diagnostic problem solving module A schematic of the problem solving system, the troubleshooting module of Meta-TS, is shown in figure 2 <ref> [Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>. The module takes as input the ICT ticket information and the PCB information. The output of the module is a diagnosis and a set of recommended repair actions. <p> Based on our data from the human operators in the NCR plant, we categorized diagnostic knowledge into two broad types, associations and heuristics <ref> [Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>. Associations are simple rules which directly map a particular symptom to a specific diagnosis. The operator may perform an intermediate action to confirm the hypothesis, but usually does not perform a series of search sequences. <p> On 84% of these episodes, the model arrived at the same diagnostic result as an operator did in the real world for the same input information; and on 68% of the episodes, similar actions were performed in the solution process <ref> [Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>. <p> This article focusses on the learning module; further details of the problem solving module can be found in <ref> [Cohen, 1990; Narayanan, Ram, Cohen, Mitchell, and Govindaraj, 1992] </ref>. 3 The introspective multistrategy learning module Although the results from the standalone model of troubleshooting showed that the problem solving module was a reasonably good model of a skilled troubleshooting operator, there were also some obvious shortcomings.

Reference-contexts: Major issues in developing an intelligent tutoring system include what to teach and how to teach; specific points of importance are the student model, the teacher model, the organization of knowledge, the simulation of the task, and the interface to the learner <ref> [Psotka, Massey, and Mutter, 1988; Spohrer and Kleiman, 1992] </ref>. Our research suggests that it would be valuable to teach shallow troubleshooting knowledge, including context-specific associative knowledge and general heuristic knowledge.

Reference-contexts: The introspector takes the reasoning trace as input. It also has methods to perform tests on the world, allowing the system to perform experiments to help in hypothesis generation and verification <ref> [Rajamoney, 1989] </ref>. These methods access the ICT information and the PCB information which is input to the problem solving system. The introspector has a set of verification actions that includes methods to obtain statistical information and to gather information from an expert troubleshooter.

Reference-contexts: While reasoning in this task domain is very different from the often shallow diagnostic processes used in assembly line manufacturing, and the two use very different kinds of knowledge, it is possible to use the same model of introspective multistrategy learning in both task domains <ref> [Ram, Cox, and Narayanan , in press] </ref>. <p> Memory organization of suspended goals, background knowledge, and reasoning strategies is as important in determining the cause of a reasoning failure as are the goals, propositions and strategies themselves <ref> [Ram, Cox, and Narayanan , in press] </ref>. Thus, memory retrieval and storage issues are relevant in deciding what to learn and which learning strategy is appropriate.

Reference-contexts: However, if the new knowledge is incorrect, it is deleted over time (see section 3.3.4). Thus, the transfer of knowledge is immediate but the sustainability of the knowledge depends on the use of the gained knowledge. 3.3.3 Postponement A third learning strategy is that of postponement <ref> [Ram, 1991] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The interaction between Meta-TS and the expert is capable of gathering the relevant associative knowledge. However, the actual mode of communication does not reflect expert-novice interaction in the real world. For example, Meta-TS currently does not model apprenticeship relationships in troubleshooting (see, for example, <ref> [Redmond, 1992] </ref>). The improvement in system performance from this learning strategy depends on the quality and validity of the expert input. The new knowledge is subject to change, depending on the future episodes encountered by the system.

Reference-contexts: In order to be more specific about the constraints on and output of the learning task, it is necessary to examine the troubleshooting model in more detail. Recent research in diagnostic problem solving has proposed the use of deep reasoning methods <ref> [Richardson, Keller, Maxion, and Polson, 1985] </ref> or integration of deep and shallow reasoning methods in knowledge-based systems [Fink and Lusth, 1987] and in tutoring systems [Lesgold, Lajoie, Bunzo, and Eggan, 1988].

Reference-contexts: This research was motivated by two considerations. First, although there has been a significant growth of research on machine learning, much of this research has not been performed in the context of complex real-world problem solving tasks (cf. <ref> [Riddle, 1992] </ref>). As a result, the issues of scalability and robustness of these methods, as they are applied to real-world problems, are still unresolved in many cases.

Reference-contexts: as a computational solution to the brittleness problem which is faced by all systems in a dynamic world. 4 1.2 The approach It is generally accepted that learning is central to intelligent reasoning systems that perform realistic reasoning tasks, such as understanding natural language stories or solving non-trivial problems (e.g., <ref> [Schank, 1983] </ref>). It is impossible to anticipate all possible situations in advance and to hand-program a machine with exactly the right knowledge to deal with all the situations that it might be faced with.

Reference-contexts: While experimental results in the metacognition literature suggest that introspective reasoning of the kind we propose here can facilitate reasoning and learning (see, for example, <ref> [Schneider, 1985; Weinert, 1987] </ref>), it is important to develop computational models that specify the mechanisms by which this facilitation occurs and the kinds of knowledge that these mechanisms rely on. <p> Thus, there is a moment-by-moment understanding of the content of one's own mind, and thus an internal feedback for the cognition being performed and a judgement of progress (or lack thereof). Psychological studies have confirmed a positive effect between meta-memory and memory performance in cognitive monitoring situations <ref> [Schneider, 1985; Wellman, 1983] </ref>. This directly supports the hypothesis that there must be a review phase or a parallel review process that introspects to some degree about the performance element in an intelligent system.

Many of the above reviews (e.g., <ref> [Chi, 1987; Schneider, 1985; Wellman, 1983] </ref>) cite evidence for such claims. Research in Meta-XP theory is a step in the direction in adding this metacognitive 44 monitoring capability to AI systems, but this is well beyond the capabilities of Meta-TS at present.

Reference-contexts: For example, Meta-XPs can represent the difference between remembering and forgetting [Cox and Ram, 1992a]. Since forgetting is the absence of a successful outcome, this is difficult to capture in most frameworks. Forgetting is an important issue in machine learning [Markovitch and Scott, 1993] and in metamemory <ref> [Spear, 1978; Wellman and Johnson, 1979] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Major issues in developing an intelligent tutoring system include what to teach and how to teach; specific points of importance are the student model, the teacher model, the organization of knowledge, the simulation of the task, and the interface to the learner <ref> [Psotka, Massey, and Mutter, 1988; Spohrer and Kleiman, 1992] </ref>. Our research suggests that it would be valuable to teach shallow troubleshooting knowledge, including context-specific associative knowledge and general heuristic knowledge.

Reference-contexts: The approach is novel because it allows strategy selection systems to reason about themselves and make decisions that would normally be hard-coded into their programs by the designer, adding considerably to the power of such systems. Meta-reasoning has been shown to be useful in planning and understanding systems (e.g., <ref> [Stefik, 1981; Wilensky, 1984] </ref>). Our research shows that meta-reasoning is useful in multistrategy learning as well. To realize this ability, our model incorporates algorithms for learning and introspection, as well as representational methods using which a system can represent and reason about its meta-models.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms are tailored to particular problems including inductive learning (e.g., induction of decision trees [Quinlan, 1986], conceptual clustering [Michalski and Stepp, 1983; Fisher, 1987]), analytical learning (e.g., explanation-based learning [DeJong and Mooney, 1986; Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli, 1986], learning from explanation failures <ref> [Hall, 1988; VanLehn, Jones, and Chi, 1992] </ref>), and analogical learning (e.g., analogy [Falkenhainer, 1989; Gentner, 1989], case-based learning [Carbonell, 1986; Hammond, 1989]). Recently, there has been much interest in multistrategy learning, and several approaches have been suggested (see, e.g., [Michalski and Tecuci, in press]).

Reference-contexts: The trace holds explicit information concerning the manner in which knowledge gaps are identified, the reasons why particular hypotheses are generated, the strategies chosen for verifying candidate hypotheses, and the basis for choosing particular reasoning methods for each of these. Trace Meta-XPs are similar to reasoning traces <ref> [Carbonell, 1986; Minton, 1988; Veloso and Carbonell, 1991] </ref> or justification structures [Birnbaum, Collins, Freed, and Krulwich, 1990; deKleer, Doyle, Steele, and Sussman, 1977; Doyle, 1979], with the difference that Trace Meta-XPs represent, in addition to the subgoal structure of the problem and justifications for operator selection decisions, information about the structure

They know how to allocate mental resources and can judge when learning is over. Many of the above reviews (e.g., [Chi, 1987; Schneider, 1985; Wellman, 1983]) cite evidence for such claims.

Reference-contexts: There are four important ways that metacognitive knowledge and capabilities bear on work in introspective learning. First, and foremost, is the emphasis on cognitive self-monitoring. This behavior is a human's ability to read their own mental states during cognitive processing <ref> [Flavell and Wellman, 1977; Wellman, 1983; Wellman, 1985] </ref>. Thus, there is a moment-by-moment understanding of the content of one's own mind, and thus an internal feedback for the cognition being performed and a judgement of progress (or lack thereof). <p> Thus, there is a moment-by-moment understanding of the content of one's own mind, and thus an internal feedback for the cognition being performed and a judgement of progress (or lack thereof).
