Title: Quantum algorithms  
Author: Ajit Narayanan 
Address: Library  Exeter EX4 4PT UK  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Old  University of Exeter  
Abstract: The paper introduces the basic concepts and principles behind quantum computing and examines in detail Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring very large numbers. Some basic methodological principles and guidelines for constructing quantum algorithms are stated. The aim is not to provide a formal exposition of quantum computing but to identify its novelty and potential use in tackling NP-hard problems.

Reference-contexts: U can simulate any Turing machine with perfect precision, where a TM in turn is a theoretical model that can simulate the execution of a single algorithm on a classical computer. Deutsch <ref> [Deutsch, 1985] </ref> showed that a universal quantum computer Q can perfectly simulate any TM and can also simulate any quantum computer or simulator with arbitrary precision. Quantum computers cannot compute a function that is not Turing-computable, but they do give new methods of computation for many classes of problem. <p> A theory of quantum computational networks which is a generalisation of the theory of quantum logic gates is also described [Deutsch, 1989], thereby grounding such networks in future developments in nanotechnology, where the operation of nano-devices will be best (and perhaps only) described at the quantum level. Deutsch <ref> [Deutsch, 1985, Deutsch, 1989] </ref> also showed that any physical process could be modelled perfectly on a quantum computer, and that such a computer would be able to perform tasks more quickly than traditional machines.

Reference-contexts: Deutsch <ref> [Deutsch, 1997] </ref> uses this exponential growth within Shor's quantum algorithm to argue that the algorithm provides evidence for the parallel universes interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Reference-contexts: Why it should do this is not known on this interpretation. Similarly, a particle the position of which is given by two state vectors A and B is said to be at A and B at the same time. This can lead to the `many universes' interpretation <ref> [Everett, 1957] </ref>: we must imagine all quantum systems exist in parallel universes. When a single photon passes through the two slits, the photon passes through the first slit in one universe, and through the second slit in another universe.

Reference-contexts: Richard Feynman <ref> [Feynman, 1982, Feynman, 1986] </ref> showed how a quantum system could be used to perform computations and could act as a simulator for probabilistically weighted quantum processes, where such simulations are impossible to achieve efficiently on a conventional probabilistic or non-deterministic automaton.

Reference-contexts: However, this claim is premature, for two reasons. First, Shor's quantum algorithm has not been realised on quantum hardware, except for claims that NMR technology using bulk spin resonances has been used for implementing extremely small scale versions of the algorithm <ref> [Gershenfeld and Chung, 1997] </ref>. 11 Secondly, there is the problem of possible exponential growth within a universe in terms of the time required in order for a pattern to repeat itself.

Reference-contexts: This measurement causes the universes to interfere with each other, and yields the photon's position. Mathematically, the behaviour of waves, such as water-waves, going through slits can be described in terms of the intensity (I) or energy of the wave as measured by its height (h) <ref> [Hey and Walters, 1987] </ref>: I = h 2 That is, the energy of a wave depends on the square of the maximum height of the wave. The height of a wave can go up and down, and therefore h will have positive and negative values.

Reference-contexts: For n possible states, there will be n different complex number 2 There is disagreement on whether quantum computers can ever be built, because of their susceptibility to noise caused by thermal vibrations and construction faults <ref> [Landauer, 1995] </ref>. 3 Strictly speaking, it cannot be called an `algorithm' since it is not guaranteed to halt or return the right results when it does halt, as will be seen later. 2 orbit is such that it goes through two complete `cycles' around the atom, starting at some point in

Reference-contexts: So although there are no known fast classical algorithms for factorising large numbers into primes, Shor's method uses known fast algorithms for taking a candidate prime factor of n and determining whether it is in fact a prime factor.

Reference-contexts: As well as these theoretical developments, claims have also been made <ref> [Shor, 1994] </ref> that polynomial quantum computing algorithms exist for problems (e.g. factoring of large integers into primes, discrete logarithms) which are considered non-polynomial (i.e. NP-hard) on classical computers. <p> Despite this breakthrough, cryptographers reassured themselves with the thought of adding more digits to their codes. The problem of factoring numbers becomes exponentially harder the larger they are. However, Shor <ref> [Shor, 1994] </ref> outlined a quantum algorithm that would factorise RSA-129 in a few seconds, if we could build a quantum computer that ran as fast as a modern PC. 4.2 Shor's quantum method for factorising The `many universes' interpretation is used by Shor in his quantum computing method for extracting prime <p> The aim of this paper is not to present a formal exposition of quantum-inspired methods but to demonstrate the feasibility of such methods and the novelty of the paradigm. As Shor points out <ref> [Shor, 1994] </ref>, in addition to the complexity class NP (intuitively, the class of exponential search problems) there is the class PSPACE, which are those problems which can be solved with an amount of memory polynomial with respect to the input size, and the class BPP, which are problems which can be

Reference-contexts: This suggests that the computational power of a quantum computer can exceed that of a classical one not in what can be computed but in the efficiency of computation. The universal TM U <ref> [Turing, 1936] </ref> is the most general possible classical computer, and all general purpose computers are approximations to it. U can simulate any Turing machine with perfect precision, where a TM in turn is a theoretical model that can simulate the execution of a single algorithm on a classical computer.
