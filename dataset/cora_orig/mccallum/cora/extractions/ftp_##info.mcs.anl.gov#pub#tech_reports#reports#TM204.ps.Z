Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Nexus is a runtime library designed primarily as a compiler target for langages supporting task-parallel and mixed data- and task-parallel execution. The Nexus interface and Nexus design are described elsewhere <ref> [1, 2] </ref>; here, we provide the information needed to execute programs that use Nexus services. We term a compiler that targets the Nexus runtime system a Nexus compiler, and an executable built with such a compiler a Nexus executable.
