Abstract: The interest in new hybrid AI models, both symbolic and numeric, is currently increasing due to the complementary capabilities of these models. We present here the Cellular Abstract Machine (CAM), a tool for building such hybrid systems, taking the form of heterogeneous networks of cooperating agents (here called cells). Several AI applications have been written using the CAM, including a sample hybrid system. The CAM is implemented over a parallel architecture (a Transputer network). We give here the basic principles of the parallel imple mentation.

Reference-contexts: The basic agents are called cells. The main features of the computational model are: * The communication graph between cells is explicit. This means that a connection between two agents must be declared explicitly and lasts until explicitly destroyed. This is a first difference compared to classical actor models <ref> [ Agha, 1986 ] </ref> in which messages are sent using logical addresses, thus providing abstraction for the communication pattern. * The users declare cell types statically before run time. <p> Every cell updates synchronously in a cyclic way, making the CAM model a synchronous MIMD model. This is probably the main difference with classical actor models of computation <ref> [ Agha, 1986 ] </ref> where concurrency is asynchronous. 3.2 Components of cell type declarations A cell may be seen as a basic abstract processor, with internal data storage, explicit connections to other cells, and an associated executable program responsible for periodically updating the output values of the connections to other cells.

Reference-contexts: These paradigms appear to be quite complementary, as demonstrated in many studies ( <ref> [ Amy, 1991 ] </ref> [ Gutknecht and Pfeifer, 1990 ] ): where the symbolic paradigm is weak, the connectionist paradigm is strong, and vice-versa. Symbolic models (SM) easily handle deductive reasoning (e.g., expert systems) and knowledge representation (facts and rules), have good explanation capabilities, can handle sequential, step-by-step processing. <p> problem (because of a noisy input or a lack of rules.) This sort of HS tends to provide powerful expert systems with new features: the ability to learn from examples, the ability to increase their knowledge and performance with experience and the ability to deal with noisy or contradictory inputs. <ref> [ Amy, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Gutknecht et al., 1991 ] describe such systems. * The idea of a tightly coupled HS is to find a new reasoning model, by strongly associating symbols and connectionism.

Reference-contexts: between broadcast and addressed modes has been implemented, which minimizes the system data routing delays [ Gay, 1992 ] . 6 Advancement of the implementation and conclusion The results achieved so far by the CAM project are promising: * A first CAM prototype is running on sequential computer since 1990 <ref> [ Cornu and Haton, 1990 ] </ref> . This prototype was associated with a first rough and simple programming language.

Reference-contexts: the CAM. 4 Implementation of a hybrid model on the CAM: an example Several types of AI programs, connectionist as well as symbolic, have been written using the CAM formalism: traditional connectionist algorithms like the Hop-field model and multi-layered perceptron [ Cornu, 1992 ] , a small markers propagation network <ref> [ Cornu, 1990 ] </ref> inspired from NETL [ Fahlman, 1979 ] and a hybrid system called Resyn described in this section (see also [ Lalle-ment, 1991 ] ). 4.1 The hybrid model The Resyn network implements two different inference mechanisms, both founded on a localist representation of knowledge (one node for

Reference-contexts: Then, for performance reasons, system data can be broadcasted rather than addressed, depending on the data volume to send. An automatic switching between broadcast and addressed modes has been implemented, which minimizes the system data routing delays <ref> [ Gay, 1992 ] </ref> . 6 Advancement of the implementation and conclusion The results achieved so far by the CAM project are promising: * A first CAM prototype is running on sequential computer since 1990 [ Cornu and Haton, 1990 ] .

Reference-contexts: Thus we use an addressed routing, that avoids sending data to processors which will not worry about them, and minimizes the routed data volume. This is a store-and-forward distributed routing <ref> [ Ni and McKinley, 1993 ] </ref> . Thus broadcast communication is used for user data whereas addressed routing is used for system data. Anyway, for small messages, routing control informations become bigger than messages themselves. Addressed routing issues more and smaller messages than broadcast, and thus becomes less efficient.

Reference-contexts: The research is in its infancy, but some models are starting to give interesting results. <ref> [ Sun, 1991 ] </ref> designed a HS to handle common sense and similarity reasoning. Such hybrid systems are usually designed as networks with various types of nodes and communication between these nodes. Hybrid systems are by essence constituted of several computing elements of different natures and different sizes. <p> new object (flipper) new feature (paws,organs) new feature (fins,organs) new feature (walk,movt) new feature (swim,movt) connect (mammal,paws,1) connect (mammal,walk,1) connect (fish,fins,1) connect (fish,swim,1) is a (dolphin,mammal) is a (flipper,dolphin) is a (elephant,mammal) is like (dolphin,fish) Due to its hybrid nature, the model can represent an analogy between objects, not unlike <ref> [ Sun, 1991 ] </ref> . If several objects share enough common features, the activation of one of them will cause the activation of the other ones. In a similar manner, when some features of an object are active enough, then this object will tend to become active too.

Reference-contexts: However, symbolic models have trouble with learning, with noisy inputs, with generalization. Connectionist models (CM), on the opposite, have inherent learning capabilities, do not care of noise, can easily generalize, and have a graceful performance degradation. Their weakness mainly concerns knowledge representation and rule manipulation. <ref> [ Touretzki, 1990 ] </ref> and [ Aj-janagadde and Shastri, 1991 ] give tracks about how neural nets can manipulate structured knowledge but these methods tend to reduce generalization and learning capabilities of these nets.
