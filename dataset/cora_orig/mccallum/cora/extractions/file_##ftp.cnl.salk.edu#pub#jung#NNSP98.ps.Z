Abstract: Pervasive electroencephalographic (EEG) artifacts associated with blinks, eye-movements, muscle noise, cardiac signals, and line noise poses a major challenge for EEG interpretation and analysis. Here, we propose a generally applicable method for removing a wide variety of artifacts from EEG records based on an extended version of an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm [2, 12] for performing blind source separation on linear mixtures of independent source signals. Our results show that ICA can effectively separate and remove contamination from a wide variety of artifactual sources in EEG records with results comparing favorably to those obtained using Principal Component Analysis.

Reference-contexts: The learning rule can be derived by maximizing output joint entropy, H (y), with respect to W [2], giving, W / @W fi W (1) where ^p i = (@=@u i ) ln (@y i =@u i ). The `natural gradient' W T W term <ref> [1] </ref> avoids matrix inversions and speeds convergence. The form of the nonlinearity g (u) plays an essential role in the success of the algorithm. The ideal form for g () is the cumulative density function (cdf) of the distributions of the independent sources.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we use sample simulated and experimental EEG data containing various types of artifacts to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, and compare results to those of PCA. 2 INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS Bell and Sejnowski <ref> [2] </ref> have proposed a simple neural network algorithm that blindly separates mixtures, x, of independent sources, s, using infomax. <p> This implies that the distribution of the output y i approximates a uniform density. Independence is achieved through the nonlinear squashing function which provides necessary higher-order statistics through its Taylor series expansion. The learning rule can be derived by maximizing output joint entropy, H (y), with respect to W <ref> [2] </ref>, giving, W / @W fi W (1) where ^p i = (@=@u i ) ln (@y i =@u i ). The `natural gradient' W T W term [1] avoids matrix inversions and speeds convergence. <p> The ideal form for g () is the cumulative density function (cdf) of the distributions of the independent sources. In practice, if we choose g () to be a sigmoid function (as in <ref> [2] </ref>), the algorithm is then limited to separating sources with super-Gaussian distributions.

Reference-contexts: Use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been proposed to remove eye artifacts from multichannel EEG by Lins et al [13] who showed that ocular artifacts can be removed more effectively by PCA than by regression or by using spatio-temporal dipole models <ref> [3] </ref>. However, PCA cannot completely separate eye artifacts from brain signals, especially when they have comparable amplitudes [11]. Most EEG correction techniques focus on removing ocular artifacts from the EEG, and relatively little work has been done on removing artifacts such as muscle activity, cardiac signals, electrode noise, etc.

Reference-contexts: An elegant way of generalizing the learning rule to sources with either sub- or super-Gaussian distributions is to approximate the estimated probability density function (pdf) in the form of a 4 th -order Edgeworth approximation as derived by Girolami and Fyfe <ref> [6] </ref>. For sub-Gaussians, the following approximation is possible: ^p i = + tanh (u i ) u i . For super-Gaussians, the same approximation becomes ^p i = tanh (u i ) u i .

Real EEG Data The EEG data set used in the analysis was collected from 20 scalp electrodes placed according to the International 10-20 System and from 2 EOG placements, all referred to the left mastoid.
