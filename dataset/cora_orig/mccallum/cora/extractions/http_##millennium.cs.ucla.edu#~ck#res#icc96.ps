Abstract: behind the HOL cells (that were blocked) compete for outputs that are still idle (i.e. they have not received any cells during the current time slot). In the same fashion a contention cycle that is comprised of a total of w rounds, can have during the i-th round the i-th (deep in the queue) cells contend for a free output. It should be made clear that only one cell is allowed to be switched from a single input and only one cell can be served by an output port during a time slot. For w=1, we have the regular pure input-buffered switch. In our comparison we consider a Look-ahead scheme with a window of w = 2. We feel that a window of two makes it comparable to the Odd-Even model where contention resolution also consists of two rounds (one for polling the odd and one for polling the even queues). Also, note that in both strategies only one cell can be cleared from a single input port (there is not any speedup feature). Figure 8 illustrates how the three models, namely the Odd-Even, the Look-ahead and the regular one compare, assuming Bernoulli arrivals. We see that the throughputs of the Odd-Even and the Look-ahead are very close. However as traffic becomes burstier this is not any longer true, and the Odd-Even performs much better, since a window of w = 2 for Look-ahead has a rather decreasing advantage (see figure 9). In this paper we have described a new crossbar, input-buffered ATM switch, the Odd-Even switch, which allows incoming cells to be stored in either of the two FIFOs placed in every input port, according to their destination, namely odd or even. Its performance has been ex amined rather extensively via simulation and under various conditions and assumptions i.e. balanced, bursty, non-uniform traffic and compared to the ordinary input buffered switch. Moreover, we compared the Odd-Even model against the Look-ahead scheme for which we assumed a window of w = 2, in order to make it comparable to the Odd-Even. In all cases, it has been demonstrated that the Odd-Even can achieve a gain of more than 20% in throughput over the regular input buffered switch, while the average delay is decreased accordingly.
