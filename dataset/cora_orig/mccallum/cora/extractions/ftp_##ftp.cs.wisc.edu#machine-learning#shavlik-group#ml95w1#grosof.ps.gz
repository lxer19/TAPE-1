Abstract: An extended version of this paper is available as an IBM Research Report via the above address, including as a postscript file on the World Wide Web. It includes a review of relevant concepts of defaults and precedence from non-monotonic logical formalisms, as well as a variety of other material, especially discussion. We raise and discuss several issues of advice taking and instruction, including: the challenges of very small samples of opinion, and of assimilation with a large, complex prior knowledge base. We focus especially on the problem of conflicting yes/no rules. We observe the availability of natural kinds of information, e.g., authority, reliability, freshness, and specificity, as the basis for reasoning about precedence. By precedence we mean in the sense of resolving conflicts between rules on the basis of qualitative ordinal information. We propose an approach to this problem of conflict: via defaults and reasoning about such precedence, drawn from knowledge representation and commonsense reasoning. We initially developed this approach in previous work. Here, we elaborate it, abstract it to a more conceptual level, and present it for a machine learning audience. Also, we abstract it away from the details of, and dependency on, one particular non-monotonic logical formalism. We see the value of this approach not as being all-embracing, but as providing a step towards elements of future approaches to advice-taking and instruction.

Reference-contexts: In such situations of very small "samples", most inductive learning methods, which are typically statistical in flavor, do not have much help (or confidence) to offer. The work of [ Maes, 1994 ] <ref> [ Lashkari et al., 1994 ] </ref> is an interesting approach, viewable as advice-taking, which exploits a community of agents via communicating example sets. Nearest-neighbor inductive learning then becomes the basis for the advice-taker's beliefs.

Reference-contexts: This kind of implicit presumption of specficity precedence has been studied extensively in the non-monotonic reasoning community, e.g., <ref> [ Touretzky, 1986 ] </ref> . In developing rule bases, this potential for conflict partly arises after knowledge is encoded, due to in ference and representation mechanisms that involve logical non-monotonicity, e.g., the use of negation-as-failure and inheritance with exceptions.
