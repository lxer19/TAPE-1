Reference-contexts: We use this in tournament Hitech to avoid doing deep searches, when a shallow null move search sees no significant threats. We use it in B* Hitech to find the Optimistic (or upper) bound. Other more ambitious selective alpha-beta schemes are described in <ref> [1, 7] </ref>. However, all these schemes are deficient in that they look for certain kinds of moves on which to continue the analysis, and the definitions used by the search paradigm are not broad enough to include all useful moves. <p> For instance, it is essentially impossible to have a static analysis detect threats of mate in 3 moves. The singular extension scheme <ref> [1] </ref> which seemed so promising for such purposes, has received mixed reviews as to its efficacy. The most popular scheme at the moment is called "partial depths". In this scheme, moves that are "active" may not be counted as a full ply. <p> The distributions backed up for A and B will be quite different, while the ranges are the same. 4 This notion has been variously tapped in the history of searching. Slagle [30] postulated the M & N search, and the idea was also central to singular extensions <ref> [1] </ref>. 4 2.3 The Springboard for the Present Work These new insights resulted in a thesis by Palay [26] which decidedly improved the performance of the B* style of searching. Unfortunately, this important contribution still remains largely unrecognized at this time.

Reference-contexts: At the high-cost end of the spectrum, we have the B* approach. Here probe searches are done to establish likely bounds on the value of a subtree. Such schemes go collectively by the name of selective search <ref> [2] </ref>. They direct the power of the search into what is hoped to be important subtrees. Examples include: One popular scheme is to go to some finite depth (say 5 or 6), and then expand selectively to some further depth, only those moves that are deemed "worthy" of further attention.
