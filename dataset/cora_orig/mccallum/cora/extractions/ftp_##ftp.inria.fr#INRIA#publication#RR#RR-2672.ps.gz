Elementary differential geometry says that the length of a parametric curve (t), t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with respect to the metric tensor M (x) is defined by: L () = 0 0 (t)M ((t)) 0 (t)dt: (2) Up to now, two different control spaces have been presented: those composed by a refinement function and those constituted by a Riemanian metric tensor. <p> Let = [x 0 ; x 1 ] be a segment so that K 0 .

Reference-contexts: The continuous polygonal surface defined by the triangulation T G may be used, but is it possible to do better? Could we obtain `a better definition' of the initial surface S using `G 1 ' interpolation over T G ?

More general algorithms can be derived from this initial one, in order to consider surfaces with sharp edges (see <ref> [4] </ref> and [12]).

Reference-contexts: Some restrictions may also be considered, as the absence of obtuse angles, the existence of n fixed points into the mesh, : : : This problem is not a classical optimization problem as in <ref> [5] </ref> because the mesh set is not a vector space. Instead, mesh generation may be considered as a combinatorial optimization problem: a triangulation is transcribed under its graph format. Thus, the problem becomes: Find an heuristic that modifies the graph of a triangulation to minimize its associated cost-function.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Two major advantages of unstructured grids over structured grids are their applicability to complex geometries and easy incorporation for grid adaptation (see <ref> [10] </ref>, [11], [22],[23]). The introduction of mesh anisotropy minimizes the number of grid elements if the simulated physical phenomena are strongly directional (see [18] and [22]) as shocks and boundary layers in fluid mechanics. A new algorithm to generate anisotropic adapted unstructured triangular surface grids has been developed.
