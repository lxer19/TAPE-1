Abstract: In this paper we investigate representational and methodological issues in a attractor network model of the mapping from orthography to semantics based on [Plaut, 1995]. We find that, contrary to psycholinguistic studies, the response time to concrete words (represented by more 1 bits in the output pattern) is slower than for abstract words. This model also predicts that response times to words in a dense semantic neighborhood will be faster than words which have few semantically similar neighbors in the language. This is conceptually consistent with the neighborhood effect seen in the mapping from orthography to phonology [Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989, Plaut et al., 1996] in that patterns with many neighbors are faster in both pathways, but since there is no regularity in the random mapping used here, it is clear that the cause of this effect is different than that of previous experiments. We also report a rather distressing finding. Reaction time in this model is measured by the time it takes the network to settle after being presented with a new input. When the criterion used to determine when the network is settled is changed to include testing of the hidden units, each of the results reported above change the direction of effect abstract words are now slower, as are words in dense semantic neighborhoods. Since there are independent reasons to exclude hidden units from the stopping criterion, and this is what is done in common practice, we believe this phenomenon to be of interest mostly to neural network practitioners. However, it does provide some insight into the interaction between the hidden and output units during settling.

Reference-contexts: The probability of any bit being on is 0.1. We imposed a more interesting structure on the output semantic representation to capture the concepts of imageability, and semantic neighborhood. Highly imageable or concrete words are often characterized in the literature as having a richer representation <ref> [Breedin et al., 1994] </ref>. This may take the form of more semantic features for concrete words, or more sensory connections for highly imageable words.

Reference-contexts: Evidence for such an effect without a regular mapping would have interesting implications for our understanding of the regularity effect in reading. It would also make a unique prediction of attractor networks. We are aware of only one paper that looks for an effect of semantic neighborhood <ref> [Buchanan et al., 1996] </ref>. This paper reports the results of testing three deep dyslexic patients in a naming task. Reading errors of one of the patients showed significant correlation with the density of the semantic neighborhood of the stimulus words.

Reference-contexts: We have found that in our replication including hidden units in the stopping criterion has the effect of reversing this result. With hidden units in the stopping criterion, semantic priming has a stronger influence than does associative priming. For details see <ref> [Clouse, 1998] </ref>. Note that in both sets of simulations, the only change in methodology was the introduction of hidden units into the stopping criterion.

Reference-contexts: During this time the input layer activations were clamped to their noise-corrupted values so they did not change between time 0 and 4. During the back propagation phase, cross entropy error <ref> [Hinton, 1989] </ref> between the activation of the output layer and the output training pattern was injected between time t = 2 and 4. The error accumulated during this period was back-propagated to time 0, but no farther.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we explain our simulation methods and present results. These experiments represent a parametric study of the effects of certain kinds of semantic structure on lexical access. Network Architecture and back to the hidden layer.

In order to approximate continuous time, continuous network units are used. The following formula describes the activation behavior of these units. <p> Each network unit was initialized to its starting activation of 0.3, and allowed to settle. In this simulation, the network was considered settled when no output unit changed by more than 0.001 in a single time tick.

This is consistent with the regularity effect in reading. There, according to [Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989] and <ref> [Plaut et al., 1996] </ref> the effect is a result of neighborhood training. Training on one pattern has the effect of reducing reaction times on similar patterns. In our simulation, the mapping between inputs and outputs is random.

Reference-contexts: Using attractor network models, A number of experiments have been reported which lend credence to the idea that many of the effects seen during lexical access with human subjects are naturally modeled using attractor networks. Plaut et al. (1996) showed that the regularity effect demonstrated by <ref> [Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989] </ref> holds for attractor networks as well as for feed-forward networks. Plaut (1995) demonstrated semantic and associative priming in an attractor network model which implemented a random mapping whose intent was to simulate the mapping from orthography to semantics. <p> The simulation shows that being in a dense semantic neighborhood results in decreased settling times. This is consistent with the regularity effect in reading. There, according to <ref> [Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989] </ref> and [Plaut et al., 1996] the effect is a result of neighborhood training. Training on one pattern has the effect of reducing reaction times on similar patterns. In our simulation, the mapping between inputs and outputs is random. <p> We suggest rather that training on a pattern may have the effect of decreasing settling time of patterns which are nearby in output space. This within-domain neighborhood effect is distinct from the neighborhood training observed by <ref> [Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989] </ref> which we will call a between-domain neighborhood effect, although it may have significant influence on settling times even in problems which feature a regular mapping. Further study to determine the relative size of these two effects is required.
