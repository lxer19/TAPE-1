KOWALCZYK The following comments are taken from a review <ref> [2] </ref> by high school teacher and mathematics supervisor, Ethel Breuche LP `91, who used the book as a resource. I feel that this text is wonderfully rich. It is rich with examples and simple and thorough explanations. It is rich in discussion and explorations.

The site was developed by Nancy Casey and Michael Fellows <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. It includes many discrete math activities including the following: The Most Colorful Math of All (map and graph coloring); Games on Graphs; Untangling the Mathematics of Knots; Algorithms and Ice Cream for All (an interesting problem on graphs); and A Usual Day at Unusual School (logic and paradoxes).

Reference-contexts: Discrete Mathematics Through Applications (7-12) Nancy Crisler, Patience Fisher, and Gary Froelich; W. H. Freeman (for COMAP), 1994; $36. This book was developed to fill the need for a high-school level discrete mathematics text <ref> [8] </ref>. It is addressed to the student, and is less sophisticated mathematically than either FAPP or Excursions. Teachers of students in grades 7-9 (or average students in grades 10-12) have been very pleased with it; but teachers of more advanced students have found it less useful. <p> Election Theory; 2. Fair Division; 3. Matrix operations and applications; 4. Graphs and applications; 5. Recursion. Each chapter begins with a group exploration and a set of exercises to introduce the topic. This is followed by short lessons and exercises. In another article in this volume <ref> [8] </ref>, the authors give more detail on the content and development of the text. Classroom Use. One teacher used it as a text for a course called "Math in the Real World", for students at the 11th- and 12th-grade level with poor mathematics backgrounds.
Reference: [9] <author> Nathaniel Dean and Yanxi Liu, </author> <title> "Discrete Mathematics Software for K-12 Education", this volume. </title>
Reference-contexts: Overall, general-purpose programs, such as spreadsheets and drawing programs, or programs that allow open-ended explorations are much more useful than the many limited-use or "drill-and-kill" programs that dominate the market. As one can see in the articles <ref> [9, 36] </ref>, there is essentially no general-purpose software designed for discrete mathematics that is appropriate in grades K-12; nevertheless software intended for other purposes has proven useful. Teachers interested in using software may be interested in contacting CLIME, the Council for Logo and Technology In Mathematics Education (see the Appendix). <p> Sketchpad can also be used to generate fractal patterns, such as the Sierpinski Triangle or Koch Snowflake RECOMMENDED RESOURCES 27 (see Fractals for the Classroom, discussed in section 3.2). It is also possible to create activities that illustrate graph (network) concepts, such as those described for Netpad in <ref> [9] </ref>. A similar program, which uses slightly different conventions, but is not as well known, is Cabri (Texas Instuments), a limited version of which is installed on the new TI-92 graphing calculator.

Reference-contexts: Devaney is one of the pioneers in the applications of fractals, as well as the introduction of dynamical systems and chaos in the undergraduate and high school curriculum. See also Devaney's article in this volume <ref> [10] </ref>, his video (section 6), and the Web site he developed (section 8). Fractals, The Patterns of Chaos John Briggs; Simon and Schuster, 1992; $20 (paper). <p> Although recommended for higher grades, one teacher (Erica Voolich LP `94, email posting) found that her 7th-grade students responded enthusiastically. The only background concepts needed are that of a function and multiplication of complex numbers. (An article by Devaney on chaos is included in this volume <ref> [10] </ref> and in [19].)

This site is well worth exploring|especially for high school teachers. This site was developed by Robert Devaney, who has used these activities in teaching calculus <ref> [10] </ref> and differential equations. After exploring the site, Judy Brown LP `92 sent a note which is excerpted below. I spent a lot of time with the "chaos for the classroom" section.

Reference-contexts: Spreadsheets were rated "No. 2" in the CLIME Survey ("No. 1" was the Geometer's Sketchpad, described below). Spreadsheets are ideal for explorations involving iteration and recursion, such as experimentation with population growth and other models of change, such as described in <ref> [11, 15] </ref>. Of course, calculators can perform many of the same functions, but spreadsheets can do many calculations in parallel, and so can be much faster and easier to use. Also, data from spreadsheets can often be exported to graphics programs to be displayed in different formats. Classroom Use.

Reference-contexts: Most high school teachers find the reading level too high for their students; instead, they use it as a resource for themselves, adapting the problems for their classes. Specific examples of the use of the text are given in this volume <ref> [17, 34] </ref>. Comments. <p> This is a fascinating book, which will give you a new perspective on mathematical ideas that one often takes for granted, such as the words used for counting. Of special interest is a chapter exploring Eulerian paths, a standard topic in discrete mathematics (e.g., see <ref> [17] </ref>), as an artistic aid to story-telling in the South Pacific islands. This is the source of some of the material in the module Drawing Pictures with One Line, described on page 13. The following is an excerpt from a review by Susan Picker LP `90.

Reference-contexts: This is a beautiful book with illustrated directions for constructing polyhedra. It also introduces some of the mathematics of polyhedra, such as Euler's formula. This is a good source for classroom projects at almost all grade levels.

Reference-contexts: Logo's structure makes it especially easy to implement iteration and recursion. Classroom Use. I (Kowalczyk) have extensive experience using and teaching with Logo. For example, I used it to simulate "gnomon growth", which leads to Fibonacci spirals, as described in <ref> [20] </ref>. (The text Excursions in Modern Mathematics described in Section 2 has good material on this topic.) Charlie Hennessy LP `95, who teaches 6-8th grades, reports that it is a good tool for getting students comfortable with the concept of a variable, since students can change parameters and see the effects <p> I (Kowalczyk) used MacTutor to find a wealth of information about Fibonacci and the Fibonacci numbers (see also the article <ref> [20] </ref>, which I wrote before I found this site).
