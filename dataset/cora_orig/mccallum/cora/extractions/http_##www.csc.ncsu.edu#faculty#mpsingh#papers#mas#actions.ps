Abstract: A clear understanding and formalization of actions is essential to computing, and especially so to reasoning about and constructing intelligent agents. Several approaches have been proposed over the years. However, most approaches concentrate on the causes and effects of actions, but do not give general characterizations of actions themselves. A useful formalization of actions would be based on a general, possibly nondiscrete, model of time that allows branching (to capture agents' choices). A desirable formalization would also allow actions to be of arbitrary duration and would permit multiple agents to act concurrently. We develop a branching-time framework that allows great flexibility in how time and action are modeled. We motivate and formalize several coherence constraints on our models, which capture some nice intuitions and validate some useful inferences relating actions with time.

Reference-contexts: Time can variously be modeled as linear or branching. Allen presents an interval-based linear-time theory of actions in <ref> [ Allen, 1984 ] </ref> . Turner [ 1984, p. 88 ] and Shoham [ 1988, ch. 2 ] show that Allen's theory is not conceptually clear, especially with regard to intervals. However, Shoham too restricts his models to be linear.

Reference-contexts: But absent the jh ij operator, we cannot characterize pUq recursively in terms of actions. One useful characterization is given in section 4: this helps in giving the fixed point semantics of the temporal operators, which is a popular way of computing them <ref> [ Burch et al., 1990 ] </ref> . The above action modalities yield scenario-formulae, which can be combined with the branching-time operators A, E, and R. <p> For appropriately designed specializations of the model, such a sublanguage might lead to considerable improvements in complexity. For the purposes of reason 37 ing, it is important to draw connections with the mu-calculus, which forms the basis for many systems for logics of programs <ref> [ Burch et al., 1990 ] </ref> . Some preliminary ideas are reported in [ Singh, 1994a ] . This paper is meta-theoretic, rather than experimental|it develops a general framework that can capture assumptions of a range of possible models.

Reference-contexts: Since we are interested in reasoning about actions that agents may or may not perform, a purely deterministic model is unacceptable. Appropriate models for intelligent agents must be constructed from the intentional stance [ McCarthy, 1979 ] <ref> [ Dennett, 1987, pp. 13-35 ] </ref> , or at the knowledge level [ Newell, 1982, p. 115 ] |we take these as equivalent for our purposes. Time can variously be modeled as linear or branching. Allen presents an interval-based linear-time theory of actions in [ Allen, 1984 ] .

Reference-contexts: It is this violation that enables a situation where an agent is performing a complex action on a scenario but fails to complete it on that scenario. This is nothing but a form of the famous imperfective paradox of <ref> [ Dowty, 1977 ] </ref> , whose classic example is that one may be crossing a street, yet never actually cross it.

Reference-contexts: one place to another * A (controller) agent adjusting the flow-rate of a valve Some of these actions might be modeled as discrete or continuous, deterministic or nondeterministic, basic or composite, depending on one's needs. 2.1 The Formal Language We use a qualitative temporal language, T AB, based on CTL* <ref> [ Emerson, 1990 ] </ref> and extended with regular programs common in dynamic logic [ Kozen & Tiurzyn, 1990 ] . (The name T AB is mnemonic for a temporal language with actions and branching.) Our language captures the essential properties of actions and time that are of interest. <p> We say p is satisfiable iff for some M and t, M j= t p. The satisfaction conditions for the temporal operators are adapted from those in <ref> [ Emerson, 1990 ] </ref> . It is assumed that each action symbol is quantified over at most once in any formula. Below, pj a b is the formula resulting from the substitution of all occurrences of a in p by b. <p> For a model to represent a physical system and be specifiable by a transition relation among different states, the corresponding set of scenarios, S, must satisfy the following closure properties <ref> [ Emerson, 1990 ] </ref> . We generalize these from discrete time, which is how they were originally developed and presented. Definition 13 S is suffix-closed if the following property holds. If S 2 S, then all suffixes of S belong to S.

Reference-contexts: We expect to develop the relevant constraints in future work. Even though decision procedures are known for CTL*, no closed-form axiomatization is known <ref> [ Emerson, 1994 ] </ref> . This is an important open problem, as is determining an axiomatization for our language, T AB. Further research is required to determine the role of past-directed operators.

Reference-contexts: Both choice and limited control are thus captured. Since we seek to develop a generic, conceptual approach to actions and time, we do not explicitly restrict the actions that might be modeled. Philosophers, e.g., <ref> [ Goldman, 1970 ] </ref> , concern themselves with what is and is not a basic action. Our concerns are more modest, since computational applications come with some actions defined as within the universe of discourse. The application and the level at which we construct the model determine the basic actions.

Reference-contexts: The above concepts apply directly in understanding BDI architectures, and in characterizing communications and other interactions among agents in a multia-gent system [ Singh, 1994a; Singh, 1994b ] . They, especially intentions, also apply in natural language understanding of sentences and discourses <ref> [ Grosz & Sidner, 1986 ] </ref> . Intentions find further application in the related problems of formalizing plans and plan recognition [ Pollack, 1991 ] .

Reference-contexts: A useful enhancement to our approach is through the attachment of probabilities to the various actions. We believe that sound probabilistic constraints can be stated in such a case, and the calculations given in <ref> [ van Fraassen, 1981; Haddawy, 1996 ] </ref> can be carried out in the proposed approach with equal facility. We expect to develop the relevant constraints in future work. Even though decision procedures are known for CTL*, no closed-form axiomatization is known [ Emerson, 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: This is useful since our models must often function at multiple levels of abstraction. We also discovered that several constraints must be stated on models to capture the intuitive notion of basic actions. The sole traditional constraint of no overlap <ref> [ McDermott, 1982 ] </ref> says too little. Intuitively, acceptable models for the formal language must be branching to capture the branching-time operators and to enable us to represent agents' choices.

Reference-contexts: Other aspects of agency are not relevant here. (For no particular reason, except perhaps habit, we use masculine pronouns to refer to agents.) The agents' ignorance about the past, as about anything else, is captured by the concepts of knowledge and belief <ref> [ Moore, 1984 ] </ref> , which we do not discuss here. Each moment is associated with a possible state of the world, which is identified by the atomic conditions or propositions that hold at that moment.
