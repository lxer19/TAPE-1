Title: A SHORT NOTE COMPARING MULTIGRID AND DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION FOR PROTEIN MODELING EQUATIONS  
Author: MICHAEL HOLST AND FAISAL SAIED 
Abstract: We consider multigrid and domain decompositionmethods for the numerical solution of electrostatics problems arising in biophysics. We compare multigrid methods designed for discontinuous coefficients with domain decomposition methods, including comparisons of standard multigrid methods, algebraic multigrid methods, additive and multiplicative Schwarz domain decomposition methods, and acceleration of multigrid and domain decomposition methods with conjugate gradient methods. As a test problem, we consider a linearization of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which describes the electrostatic potential of a large complex biomolecule lying in an ionic solvent.

Introduction In recent years, multigrid (MG) and domain decomposition (DD) methods have been used extensively as tools for obtaining approximations to solutions of partial differential equations (see for example the references in <ref> [15] </ref>). In this paper, we consider MG and DD methods for the numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which describes the electrostatic potential of a large complex biomolecule lying in an ionic solvent (see for example [3, 14] for an overview).
