Title: Project Plan for CMPE276 Fall Quarter, 1998

Abstract: One method for graduate students studying software engineering to gather an appreciation for the problems and their solutions as discussed in software engineering textbooks and research papers is to expose students to real-world software engineering problems. This exposure can be done by creating a relationship with a local company. This requires that the company is willing to propose problems that can be approached by the students and provide technical consultation throughout the quarter. After some consultation with personnel from a local software house, The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), we propose the following collaboration: the CMPE276 Software Engineering fall 1998 class will investigate the problem of software project metrics collection and analysis. It is hoped that the conclusions that can be found and presented by the students at the end of the quarter in mid December, 1998, will be of use to SCO and that the quality of the work will motivate both UCSC and SCO to continue this liaison into the future.

Draw whatever conclusions from the measurement data about the process and/or product and substantiate your conclusions. Lastly, suggest improvements to the measurement plan and substantiate your suggestions.
