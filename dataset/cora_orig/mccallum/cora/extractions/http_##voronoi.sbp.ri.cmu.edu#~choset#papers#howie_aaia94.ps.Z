Abstract: This paper extends a local sensor based planning method for hyper-redundant robot mechanisms. In a previous paper, sensor feedback control methods are considered. A highly localized sensor feedback method for hyper-redundant manipulators is termed, partial shape modification (PSM). A PSM utilizes a mechanism's hyper-redundancy to enable both local obstacle avoidance and end-effector placement in real time. This paper considers the situation in which the limits of a PSM is violated. In other words, what does the robot do when it can not only locally adapt to the environment. Local sensor based planning has been implemented on a thirty degree of freedom hyper-redundant manipulator which has eleven ultrasonic distance measurement sensors and twenty infrared proximity sensors. The robot is controlled by a real time control computer which communicates with sensors through an innovative sensor bus architecture. Experimental results obtained using this test bed show the efficacy of the proposed method.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This paper extends experimental results from [TCB] in the area of local sensor based planning for hyper- redundant robot manipulators. Recall from <ref> [ChB90b] </ref> that a "hyper-redundant" manipulator is a kinematically redundant manipulator in which the degree of redundancy is very large or infinite. <p> The local sensor based planning algorithm of hyper- redundant manipulators is based on the analysis found in <ref> [ChB90b, ChB91a, ChB92a, ChB92c, Ch] </ref>. This work has been demonstrated on an actual extensible 30 degree-of-freedom hyper-redundant robot system. <p> Many of these algorithms can be extended to the spatial case. Section 4 describes the experimental setup, while Section 5 described the actual results of these experiments. 2. Background This section reviews a hyper-redundant robot kinematic analysis framework that forms the basis of this work. Recall from <ref> [ChB90b] </ref> that we assume that (regardless of mechanical implementation) the important macroscopic features of a hyper-redundant robot can be captured by a backbone curve. A backbone curve parametrization and an associated set of reference frames which evolve along the curve are collectively called the backbone reference set. <p> A backbone curve parametrization and an associated set of reference frames which evolve along the curve are collectively called the backbone reference set. In this paradigm, inverse kinematics and task planning reduces to the determination of the proper time varying behavior of the backbone reference set <ref> [ChB90b] </ref>. Similarly, local sensor based planning is equivalent in this approach to modification of the backbone curve shape in order to accommodate impinging obstacles. In [ChB92c], many techniques are introduced for parametrizing the backbone curve.

Reference-contexts: This work has been demonstrated on an actual extensible 30 degree-of-freedom hyper-redundant robot system. A hyper-redundant manipulator which can vary its length, within the limitations of its actuators, is termed "extensible." A more detailed account of this mechanism and its capabilities can be found in <ref> [ChB92b] </ref>. Robotic motion planning has been an important area of research. Since the introduction of configuration space methods [LoWes], several other theories have been published, some of which are summarized in [Sh,Lat]. <p> In figure 6, the local extensibility limit is not exceeded, and the robot is still able to accommodate for the object's displacement. 5 4.

Reference-contexts: A 50kHz sonar wave burst is transmitted when the sonar-ranging module is triggered <ref> [Ci] </ref>. The ranging module output is connected to the sensor bus interrupt request line. The echo return time is computed by the CPU hardware counter. Since the sixteen bit resolution distance measurement result is read from the hardware counter, no result is ever sent through the sensor bus. <p> These sensors are calibrated to measure distances ranging from 10cm to 2.5m, with a 2% accuracy. There is about twenty degrees of conical ambiguity for direction, because of the transmitting beam pattern of the transducer <ref> [Ci] </ref>. In this work, it is assumed that the obstacle lies along the cone's centerline, which is locally normal to the backbone curve at the point of sensor attachment. The IR sensors yield binary proximity information- i.e., the presence or absence of the obstacle in some pre-set range.

Recall from [ChB90b] that a "hyper-redundant" manipulator is a kinematically redundant manipulator in which the degree of redundancy is very large or infinite. <p> However, this work assumes that there are perfect sensors on the robot; nor has it been implemented on a real robot. Hirose [HiU] implemented an "active cord" mechanism, which used tactile sensors to guide its motion. A previous paper <ref> [TCB] </ref> presents preliminary strategies for local sensor based planning, which are implementable in real time, can employ a variety of sensors, and exploit the benefits of hyper-redundancy. In this paper, a local sensor based planning strategy for hyper-redundant manipulators is extended so it can be more accommodating. <p> In this paper, a local sensor based planning strategy for hyper-redundant manipulators is extended so it can be more accommodating. The local sensor based planner in <ref> [TCB] </ref> did not consider its own limitations. There, the hyper-redundant manipulator can only locally adapt to a changing environment over a fixed length of the robot. For a fixed length of robot, a hyper-redundant manipulator uses its extensibility so it can locally avoid obstacles.
