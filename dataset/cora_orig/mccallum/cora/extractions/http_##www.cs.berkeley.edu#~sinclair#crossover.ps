Title: A Computational View of Population Genetics (preliminary version)  
Author: Yuval Rabani Yuri Rabinovich Alistair Sinclair 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the study of nonlinear dynamical systems from a computational perspective. These systems are inherently more powerful than their linear counterparts (such as Markov chains), which have had a wide impact in Computer Science, and they seem likely to play an increasing role in future. However, there are as yet no general techniques available for handling the computational aspects of discrete nonlinear systems, and even the simplest examples seem very hard to analyze. We focus in this paper on a class of quadratic systems that are widely used as a model in population genetics and also in genetic algorithms. These systems describe a process where random matings occur between parental chromosomes via a mechanism known as "crossover": i.e., children inherit pieces of genetic material from different parents according to some random rule. Our results concern two fundamental quantitative properties of crossover systems: 1. We develop a general technique for computing the

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is well known that linear dynamical systems (in the form of branching processes and Markov chains) have had a major impact in algorithmic and analytical applications in Computer Science (see, e.g., <ref> [2] </ref> and the surveys [12,14]). In contrast, and despite their inherently greater power, the study of nonlinear dynamical systems in Computer Science is still in its infancy (though we mention some recent exceptions below).

Reference-contexts: In the nonlinear case, however, there is as yet very little general theory (such as eigenvalues) to guide us, and even the simplest systems appear extremely hard to analyze. For example, the rate of convergence of the Boltzmann equation is a long-standing open problem in theoretical physics <ref> [5] </ref>. The second question we address concerns the feasibility of representing the evolution of a finite population by a QDS. The dynamical system (1) operates on probability distributions, and hence implicitly assumes that the population consists of an infinite number of individuals.

Reference-contexts: such algorithms is a "mating" operator, which in many cases is modeled by equation (1). y Nonlinear systems have also been used as an analytical tool in various contexts: examples included Valiant's construction of small-sized monotone circuits for majority [21], Clarkson et al 's approximation algorithm for the center point <ref> [6] </ref>, and the analysis of on-line fair scheduling by Ajtai et al [1].

Reference-contexts: Our techniques are elementary, but rely crucially on the novel observation that a crossover system has an equivalent formulation as an inverse process in which individuals randomly select genetic material from their ancestors. This approach parallels the use of inverse processes in the analysis of certain card-shu*ing Markov chains <ref> [7] </ref>. The inverse process allows a surprisingly clean treatment of finite populations. For the bounds on convergence rate, we further interpret the inverse process as a random partitioning process on sets, and analyze a suitable stopping time. This process seems to be of independent combinatorial interest.

Reference-contexts: By choosing the probability distribution over S (or "crossover distribution") appropriately, one can cast any desired reproductive rule in this framework. (For precise definitions and concrete examples, see Section 2.) It is a classical result dating back to 1944 <ref> [8] </ref> that any such system (under an obvious non-degeneracy assumption) converges to a stationary population in which the symbols at different positions are mutually independent; moreover, the probability distribution at each position can be determined from the initial population. <p> The first question that naturally arises is: what is the asymptotic behavior of trajectories? We say that a trajectory (p t ) 1 t=0 converges to a population p if p t ! p pointwise as t ! 1. The following classical result, first proved by Geiringer in 1944 <ref> [8] </ref>, states that every trajectory converges to a stationary population in which the loci behave independently. (A stationary population is one which remains invariant under the op erator of equation (2).)

Theorem 1 [8] For any non-degenerate crossover distribution, every trajectory (p t ) converges to a stationary population p 1 defined by p 1 (v) = Q n i=1 c i (v i ), where c i (0) and c i (1) are the probabilities of values 0 and 1 respectively at position

Reference-contexts: A common generalization is k-point crossover, in which exactly k crossovers occur at randomly chosen distinct positions. This model is particularly popular in genetic algorithms.

In particular, a QDS is in general not a good representation of the behavior of small finite populations.

Reference-contexts: Again, this seems to be the first result of its kind. The question of finite populations has recently been addressed in the population genetics literature <ref> [13] </ref>, but the notion of simulation adopted there is much weaker than ours, and the resulting finite system cannot be said to faithfully reflect the original nonlinear one.

Reference-contexts: several important systems from the natural sciences: e.g., Boltzmann's model of an ideal gas (where the types are velocities of gas molecules, and interactions are collisions between them) [17]; the Hardy-Weinberg model of population genetics (where the types are the genotypes of some species, and interactions are matings between parents) <ref> [15] </ref>; and Volterra's model of a predator-prey ecology (where the types are the predator and the prey, and interactions correspond to procreation and kills) [10]. The first two of these examples are symmet-ric. <p> This is apparently the first time that precise convergence rates have been given for these systems: the best previous analysis, using much more complex methods, gave only much weaker asymptotic information about the rate <ref> [15] </ref>. Our second contribution demonstrates that, for crossover systems, the QDS model is an appropriate mathematical abstraction for the behavior of relatively small populations of individuals. <p> There is an initial delay (the "relaxation time") that depends only logarithmically on the string length n, followed by an exponential decay at rate ln r () 1 . (ii) A weak (asymptotic in ln * 1 ) bound on the mixing time is given in <ref> [15, Theorem 6.6.1] </ref>, by a much more complex method that involves solving the evolutionary equation explicitly. This bound, however, provides no information about the relaxation time, which is of central importance in computational applications.

Reference-contexts: by large distances in the physical chromosome, and crossovers between a pair of these loci are presumed to occur in the physical model according to a Poisson process in the separating interval.) There is currently much interest in finding crossover distributions that model real biological mating more accurately: see, e.g., <ref> [16] </ref> for an extensive discussion. The chief drawback of the Poisson model is the assumption of independence of adjacent intervals. Although we will illustrate our techniques for the above standard examples, we stress that they can be applied to any crossover distribution.

Reference-contexts: Symmetry of QDSs is analogous to reversibility of Markov chains. The above framework is quite general, and captures several important systems from the natural sciences: e.g., Boltzmann's model of an ideal gas (where the types are velocities of gas molecules, and interactions are collisions between them) <ref> [17] </ref>; the Hardy-Weinberg model of population genetics (where the types are the genotypes of some species, and interactions are matings between parents) [15]; and Volterra's model of a predator-prey ecology (where the types are the predator and the prey, and interactions correspond to procreation and kills) [10].

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we focus on two questions of central importance to computational applications of QDSs. The first question concerns the rate of convergence of the system to its equilibrium state. (Recently, Rabi-novich et al <ref> [19] </ref> have shown that, under a mild technical condition, any symmetric QDS eventually converges to a stationary population.) The rate of convergence is fundamental in computational contexts, and tools for analyzing it have been essential in applications of linear systems.
