Abstract: The cooling of turbine blades in turbines is enhanced by providing the cooling ducts with ribs, so-called turbulators. It is investigated how these ribs influence the heat transfer of the cooling air on the blades. A model is given to study this problem such that it lends itself to a numerical approach. A detailed discussion is given of the problem involved. It is shown how the ideas are implemented in a numerical code. The results of the simulations are assessed showing a practical way to test the quality of these cooling ducts.

Reference-contexts: In this section we will treat the flow problem and the temperature problem separately, although the viscosity j is the quantity coupling both problems, thus making the flow problem implicitly depending on the temperature. The general equations for an incompressible Newtonian fluid will be used (see <ref> [1] </ref>, p.174). Note that we are dealing with a real fluid. However low the viscosity may be, viscous effects do play a role in this problem for the very reason that we are interested in boundary-layer effects for both temperature and velocity. <p> The first two of these forces 4 are the result of introducing the relative frame of reference. The Coriolis force and centrifugal force contributions are given by f = 2ae (! ! ! fi u) ae (! ! ! fi (! ! ! fi x)); (2.4) (see <ref> [1] </ref>, p.139). We need a constitutive equation to relate the stress tensor S to the variables u and p. For a Newtonian fluid this relation is given by S = pI + 2jD; (2.5) where the tensor D denotes the rate of strain, i.e. <p> Since ae is constant the 5 centrifugal force is conservative and can be absorbed into the pressure gra-dient term (see <ref> [1] </ref>, p.176). To this end we introduce the modified pressure p m which is defined by p m := p 2 The introduction of p m is mainly done for notational purposes. In fact this notation only pays off when the boundary conditions involve velocity components exclusively.

Reference-contexts: The most natural choice would be the values for a smooth duct. Then we can express all Nusselt numbers relative to the smooth duct. To this end we use the Dittus-Boelter correlation (see <ref> [2] </ref> p.315) which gives the following Nusselt number formula Nu = 0:023 Re 0:8 This formula makes sense for a pipe with smooth internal surface and holds in the range 0:7 Pr 120 and 2500 Re D h 1:24 10 5 .

Reference-contexts: Let V be the characteristic velocity of the flow and let c be the speed of sound, then the Mach number is defined by Ma := c For laminar flows Ma &lt; 0:3 is acceptable for considering a fluid as approximately incompressible (see <ref> [4] </ref>, p.581). For turbulent flows this assumption is valid for even higher Mach numbers (see [10], p.171).

Reference-contexts: It is clear that we should not use direct numerical simulation (DNS) for this type of flow. The requirements on the number of grid points would be prohibitive. 5.1 Turbulator shape We are interested in the cooling efficiency of turbulated ducts that are produced with the ECD technique (cf. <ref> [5] </ref>), which allows for a wide variety of turbulator shapes. In the analysis carried out in this chapter, we will consider only four different types of turbulators.

Reference-contexts: Since finite-element matrices are inherently sparse, iterative solvers are favourable for both speed and memory usage. In the following we will focus on iterative solvers and BICGSTAB in particular. This technique is discussed in [7] and is very easy to implement. Note that we use the integrated method (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>) to solve the system of equations (see Eq. (3.4)). A pre-conditioner is necessary to speed up the solver. We will use incomplete LU factorization (ILU) as a preconditioner. Since iterative methods exploit finite-element matrices being sparse, a proper matrix storage scheme is very important. <p> Since we do not want to use a direct solver we do not store the profile of the matrix in which we allow fill-in, but rather the non zeros and their position in the matrix. For more details see <ref> [6] </ref>. 11 u 1 ; u 2 ; p 4 Flow and Heat Transfer Computations 4.1 Unsteady Laminar Flow Simulations The laminar flow computations have been carried out for Reynolds numbers up to 550. With a little over 5000 unknowns, the solutions are relatively cheap to obtain. <p> This immediately raises the issue of the relation between the number of pipe segments considered and the resulting value of the periodicity index. It is worthwhile to investigate ducts with more than two segments as well, which we omit here (see <ref> [6] </ref>). 4.4 Heat transfer computations As pointed out before we solve the energy equation and the Navier-Stokes equations separately. Heat transfer computations are carried out on the same finite-element grid as used for the flow simulations.

Reference-contexts: The desired effect of the design of this particular shape is achieved; namely a 20% increase of cooling efficiency is found relative to turbulator shape 1. To validate the numerical results we have compared the results depicted in figure 19 with 23 the results in <ref> [9] </ref>. In this paper experimental data on heat transfer are pre-sented for an even larger variety of turbulator shapes. If we compare the Nusselt numbers for turbulator shapes similar to the ones shown in figure 14, we find 100 &lt; Nu D h &lt; 400 like in figure 19.

Reference-contexts: For turbulent flows this assumption is valid for even higher Mach numbers (see <ref> [10] </ref>, p.171). Our type of flow has a typical velocity of 100 m/s and since the thermal environment of a gas turbine is about 1200 K with a cooling air inlet temperature of 600 K, the speed of sound is approximately 500 m/s.
