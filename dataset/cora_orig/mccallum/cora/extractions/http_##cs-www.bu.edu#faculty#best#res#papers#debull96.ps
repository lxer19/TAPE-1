Abstract: In this paper we overview the merits of a data dissemination mechanism that allows information to propagate from its producers to servers that are closer to its consumers. This dissemination reduces network traffic and balances load amongst servers by exploiting geographic and temporal locality of reference properties exhibited in client access patterns. The level of dissemination depends on the relative popularity of documents, and on the expected reduction in traffic that results from such dissemination. We present results of log analysis and trace-driven simulations that quantify the performance gains achievable through the use of such a protocol.

Reference-contexts: In order to evaluate our dissemination protocol, we had to come up with a realistic clustering of the Internet to reflect the dissemination model introduced above and detailed in <ref> [3] </ref>. This clustering could be based on several criteria. For example, it could be based on geographical information (e.g., distance in miles between clients as suggested in [10]). Alternately, it could be based on institutional/network boundaries (e.g., assign one service proxy per institution or network). <p> the routes between a 2 Multiple updates to a document within one day were counted as one update. 3 A detailed treatment of this model, including an optimal resource allocation strategy for proxies to ration their resources amongst competing home servers belonging to the same cluster can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 server and its clients. Such a clustering (based on the distance between the server and client measured in actual route hops) allows us to quantify the savings achievable through dissemination because it makes it possible to measure the bandwidth saved in Bytes fi Hops (BHops) units. <p> The location of such proxies depends on the demand during the previous month (4 weeks) from the various parts of the tree and aims to balance the load amongst those proxies. The general dissemination model presented in <ref> [3] </ref> assumes that proxies are organized in a hierarchy. Our implementation of this idea was simpler, whereby the hierarchy was flattened by having the home server (the root of the tree) compute using the access patterns of all its clients the ultimate placement for the replicas.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The effectiveness of client-based caching for very large distributed information systems (like the WWW) is limited. This was established in a comprehensive study of client-based caching for the Web, which was conducted by our Oceans group (http://www.cs.bu.edu/groups/oceans/). In that study <ref> [4] </ref>, the effectiveness of session caching, machine caching, and proxy caching were established using a unique set of 5,700 client traces (almost 600,000 URL requests), which were obtained by intrumenting Mosaic as detailed in [6]. <p> If client-based caching is done on a per-session basis (i.e., the cache is cleared at the start of each client session), then the only locality of reference property that could be exploited is the temporal locality of reference. The results of our client-based caching study <ref> [4] </ref> suggest that for a single client, the temporal locality of reference is quite limited, especially for remote documents. <p> However, the results of our client-based caching study <ref> [4] </ref> suggest that for remote documents the amount of sharing between clients is limited. In particular, we found that even with an infinite proxy cache size, the average byte hit rate improves from 36% to 50%. Figure 1, which is reproduced from the data in [4] illustrates this point by plotting <p> of our client-based caching study <ref> [4] </ref> suggest that for remote documents the amount of sharing between clients is limited. In particular, we found that even with an infinite proxy cache size, the average byte hit rate improves from 36% to 50%. Figure 1, which is reproduced from the data in [4] illustrates this point by plotting the rate at which the proxy cache must be inflated|a measure termed the Cache Expansion Index (CEI)|to maintain a constant byte hit rate.

Reference-contexts: in latency is likely to be the result of a protocol whose primary purpose is just to do that (client-based caching in this case). 5 Another example of how our work complements other client-based protocols is related to the notion of dynamic server selection, introduced by Crovella and Carter in <ref> [5] </ref>. The primary purpose of a client-based dynamic server selection protocol is to determine "on the spot" which one of several servers to use in order to retreive a document replicated on all of these servers.

Reference-contexts: This forwarding mechanism is supported by the HTTP protocol and requires much less overhead than the more general hierarchical name resolution strategy described in <ref> [7] </ref>. In our simulations, we assume that the cost of propagating updates to proxies could be ignored.

Reference-contexts: Geographical locality of reference implies that an object accessed by a client is likely to be accessed again in the future by "nearby" clients. This property is similar to the processor locality of reference exhibited in parallel applications <ref> [8] </ref>. Spatial locality of reference implies that an object "neighboring" a recently accessed object is likely to be accessed in the future.
