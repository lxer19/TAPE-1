Abstract: In a testing environment, where an IUT communicates with multiple entities, a tester may have differing degrees of controllability on the interactions between these entities and the IUT: directly controllable, semicontrollable, or uncontrollable. In this paper, a graph conversion algorithm is introduced that offers the testability of both the directly and semicontrollable inputs, while avoiding race conditions. Although, for the most general case, the graph conversion results in an exponentially large number of nodes, practical considerations make the converted graph size feasible. Currently, this methodology is being applied to generate tests for MIL-STD 188-220B, which increases the number of testable state transitions from approximately 200 to over 700.

Reference-contexts: There are many real-life protocols that possess either semicontrollable inputs, or race conditions, or both, due to a tester's limited control over the interactions between the IUT and other communicating entities. For example, in MIL-STD 188-220B <ref> [188-220B, 1998] </ref>, over 70% of the transitions cannot be directly controlled. The race conditions can be shown in the IEEE 802.2 LLC Connection Component protocol [ISO8802-2, 1994]. Some problems due to the limited controllability over the IUT are addressed in the literature. <p> They also illustrate an important point that must be taken into account while utilizing an (N+1)-layer indirectly avoiding race conditions. MIL-STD 188-220B <ref> [188-220B, 1998] </ref> is a military standard for interoperability of command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence over Combat Net Radios. In the testing framework used to test 188-220B, the upper layers cannot be directly controlled. <p> However, by applying the technique introduced in this paper, almost all (&gt;95%) transitions defined in the specification can be tested (the number of testable transitions rose to over 700 from approximately 200 for the Class A Type 1 Service Datalink module <ref> [188-220B, 1998, Fecko et al., 1997] </ref>). 2 Connection Component. The SUT consists of the LLC layer IUT and the implementation of the upper layer (UL), whose FSM is semicontrollable. Transitions T 1 and T 4 output a Data Indication to the UL.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm presented in this paper is being applied to MIL-STD 188-220B protocol to generate conformance tests. Initial results are promising: the number of testable transitions increased to over 700 from approximately 200 for the Class A Type 1 Service Datalink module <ref> [Fecko et al., 1997] </ref>. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally defines the controllability problem, which is practically motivated in Section 3 by examples from real-life protocols. Section 4 defines a system model for a testing environment with multiple interfaces with different degrees of controllability. <p> However, by applying the technique introduced in this paper, almost all (&gt;95%) transitions defined in the specification can be tested (the number of testable transitions rose to over 700 from approximately 200 for the Class A Type 1 Service Datalink module <ref> [188-220B, 1998, Fecko et al., 1997] </ref>). 2 Connection Component.

(A detailed description of the algorithm along with its pseudocode is available in <ref> [Fecko et al., 1998] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, in practice, these two situations often are not possible. Testers may not have a direct access to all interface (s) in which the IUT accepts inputs. Typically, for an (N)-layer IUT, an exposed interface exists only between the IUT and the (N-1)-Service Provider <ref> [IS9646, 1991] </ref>. Interfaces with the upper layer, or with the peer entities (such as timers, etc.) are not directly accessible. In such cases, the interactions that involve these not directly controllable interfaces introduce non-determinism and/or race conditions during testing, leaving certain portions of the IUT model untestable. <p> The points at which a testing system can apply inputs to and observe outputs from the IUT are called points of control and observation (PCOs) <ref> [IS9646, 1991] </ref>. Each IUT's interface is associated with a full-duplex PCO through which inputs and outputs can be exchanged. <p> The analysis also is applicable to interfaces with a combination of directly controllable and semicontrollable inputs (excluding uncontrollable ones). A typical example of a directly controllable interface is a Lower Tester FSM <ref> [IS9646, 1991] </ref>. A timer FSM, whose only inputs come from an IUT (e.g., start, restart, and stop the timer), is a typical semicontrollable interface.
