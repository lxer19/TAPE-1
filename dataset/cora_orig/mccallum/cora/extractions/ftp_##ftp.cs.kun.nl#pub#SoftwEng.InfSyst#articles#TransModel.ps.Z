Abstract: This paper presents a specification of Hypertext systems on several levels of abstraction, and describes translations between these different levels. The Hypertext system will be organised according to a stratified architecture, which is a generalisation of the so-called Two Level Architecture. We describe a user interface for the Hypertext system, examine the user's elementary operations (transactions) and present the corresponding user view on the system. Next a conceptual schema is presented, that describes Hypertext from the perspective of the author (editor) of the information. We describe the user transactions in terms of operations on the conceptual schema. An object oriented implementation of this Hypertext system is presented. We show how the object hierarchy is derived from the conceptual schema.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Current research on Hypertext systems appears to focus around two aspects. Firstly, research is focussed on the design of powerful user interfaces. This topic received the most attention so far. Secondly, research is directed at basic concepts that constitute Hypertext (see for example <ref> [2] </ref> and [16]). fl This work has been supported by the ESPRIT project APPED (2499). In this paper we deal with both aspects, and relate them to each other. For this purpose we use a general architecture for Hypertext systems. <p> We describe how user transactions are translated to operations on the conceptual schema in section 5. Finally we indicate how a transaction model can be implemented in the Object Oriented Paradigm. 2 Multi-level organisation of the information model In <ref> [2] </ref> a new mechanism was presented to structure Hypertext into two levels.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we deal with both aspects, and relate them to each other. For this purpose we use a general architecture for Hypertext systems. We follow the approach for Information System Architecture as sketched in <ref> [3] </ref>, and consider a Hypertext system as consisting of the following components (see figure 1): information processor ' $ information base conceptual description information model - information system user interface 1. the information model. This is also denoted as application model or as title ([2]).

Reference-contexts: There are several approaches for specifying the structure of the information. For example, context free rules are used to describe the structure of a document in SGML [10], which seems to be the emerging defacto standard for this purpose. Other possibilities in this regard are ODA <ref> [4] </ref> and T E X [11]. We basically adopt the grammar based approach of SGML.

Reference-contexts: This behaviour will then serve as a base to build the associated transaction model. To describe the interaction of the system with a user we use the conceptual dialogue specification technique DST (see <ref> [5] </ref> and [6]). First the DST-technique will be introduced briefly. We use the style that was presented in [9]. The intention of a DST-diagram is to describe a dialogue, usually between man and machine.

Reference-contexts: A fourth option is to give a partial description of subject of interest and to go to that subject in the hyperbase. This is often called a query. We will not deal with query handling in this paper but refer to <ref> [8] </ref> for this. 5. Of course there is also the possibility of leaving the Hypertext system. The various options are depicted in a DST-diagram in figure 4. 3.2 The user's concepts/elementary transactions In the previous section the behaviour of the system towards the user was introduced.
