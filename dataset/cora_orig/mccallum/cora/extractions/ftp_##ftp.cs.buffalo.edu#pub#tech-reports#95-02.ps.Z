Title: Pseudorandom Generators, Measure Theory, and Natural Proofs

Abstract: This paper proves that if strong pseudorandom number generators or one-way functions exist, then the class of languages that have polynomial-sized circuits is not small within exponential time, in terms of the resource-bounded measure theory of Lutz. More precisely, if for some " &gt; 0 there exist nonuniformly 2 n " -hard PSRGs, as is widely believed, then P/poly does not have measure zero in EXP. Our results establish connections between the measure theory and the "natural proofs" of Razborov and Rudich. Our work is also motivated by Lutz's hypothesis that NP does not have measure zero in EXP; obtaining our results with NP in place of P/poly would show much more far-reaching consequences from the existence of PSRGs than are currently known.

Reference-contexts: It also follows from our results that if there is a pseudorandom function generator [7] of exponential security in nonuniform NC 1 , then nonuniform NC 1 is not measurable in EXP.

We prove our theorems by showing that the martingales used in defining Lutz's measure theory yield natural properties, as defined by Razborov and Rudich [26], of equivalent nonuniform complexity that diagonalize against (or "are useful against") the class C on which the martingale succeeds. <p> Hence the above is equivalent to the formulations originally used by Lutz in [15]. (We return to the robustness issue when discussing the measures on D = P defined by Allender and Strauss <ref> [2] </ref>.) 4 If (CjD) = 0, then C " D is intuitively "small" as a subclass of D. If NP is small within E [or within EXP], then there is a single [quasi-]polynomial time computable betting strategy that succeeds simultaneously against every language in NP. <p> The classical time-hierarchy theorems carry over to measure; in particular, P and QP have measure zero in E, and E itself, indeed DTIME [2 n c ] for any fixed c, has measure zero in EXP. It is shown in <ref> [15, 16, 2] </ref> that classes of measure zero behave very much like null-sets in classical measure theory. The complement (in D) of a measure-zero subclass C has (D) measure 1 (this is a definition in [15, 16] and a theorem in [21]). <p> size bounds for D are noted by Razborov [25]: Theorem 7.

The Uniform Case and Honest Martingales The next interesting question is whether Theorem 11 can be made to work under the hypothesis that for some fl &gt; 0 there is a one-way function of security 2 n fl against uniform adversaries. <p> This is what is needed for the Razborov-Rudich result.

Reference-contexts: This is interesting because ordinarily one thinks of P/poly as a tractable class, much lower down than NP on the complexity scale. What our proof brings out is the large role played by nonuniformity. It also follows from our results that if there is a pseudorandom function generator <ref> [7] </ref> of exponential security in nonuniform NC 1 , then nonuniform NC 1 is not measurable in EXP. We also prove unconditionally that non-uniform AC 0 [2] is not measurable under either of the measures defined by Allender and Strauss [2]. <p> The main problem is that the natural property we construct in Proposition 10 is non-uniform, and this non-uniformity carries over to the statistical test constructed in the theorem of Razborov and Rudich, drawing on <ref> [7] </ref>. That is, the property belongs to QP/poly. <p> It remains to verify that the statistical test constructed from by Razborov and Rudich, drawing on <ref> [7] </ref>, is computable by a probabilistic Turing machine in time less than 2 k fl . Let d (w) be computable in time 2 (log jwj) c on inputs w. Let a PSRG G : f0; 1g k ! f0; 1g2k be given. <p> Let a PSRG G : f0; 1g k ! f0; 1g2k be given. Given fl, take " &lt; fl, and take n = k "=c . (In [26], with a P/poly-natural property, they have c = 1.) Recall the construction of "G y (x)" in <ref> [26, 7] </ref>, and of the pseudorandom function generator defined by f x (y) = the first bit of G y (x). Here jxj = k and jyj = n, and x can be thought of as "advice" to compute the pseudorandom function f in time polynomial in n. <p> Then for k = q (n), n can be used as a statistical test against f , along the lines laid out by Razborov and Rudich, using the tree-construction from <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> The languages L involved are defined by non-uniform sequences of seeds x for the "amplified generator" f x = G x (y) defined from G in <ref> [26, 7] </ref>. These seeds define the circuits C n in our key Lemma 9. The selection of sequences C n in Lemma 9 is non-uniform, however.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The theory of resource-bounded measure, initiated by Lutz [14, 15, 16] and furthered in <ref> [20, 12, 17, 18, 19, 13, 1, 21] </ref>, has provided a useful framework that links many central problems in complexity theory. Classes that have measure zero are small in a quantitative sense described by Lutz in [16]. <p> Languages are regarded as points in the topological space 3 whose basic open sets are the "cylinders" C w , one for each w 2 f0; 1g fl , and complexity classes are point sets. The general form of Lutz's theory, expounded recently by Mayordomo <ref> [21] </ref>, defines conditions for a class C to be measurable by a function class , and to have measure e, written (C) = e, where 0 e 1. Since all complexity classes we discuss are closed under finite variations, and by a form of the Kolmogorov zero-one law proved in [21] <p> <ref> [21] </ref>, defines conditions for a class C to be measurable by a function class , and to have measure e, written (C) = e, where 0 e 1. Since all complexity classes we discuss are closed under finite variations, and by a form of the Kolmogorov zero-one law proved in [21] have measure zero or one, we need only discuss conditions for classes to have measure zero. This thesis and [15, 16] show that these measurability conditions can be defined in terms of martingales of the kind studied earlier by Schnorr [29, 30, 31]. <p> Definition 2 (compare <ref> [15, 21] </ref>). Let be a complexity class of functions. <p> For any class C, Lutz writes (CjD) = 0, read "C has measure zero within D," if (D) (C " D) = 0. Two instances of particular importance are: D = E, = P, Mayordomo <ref> [21] </ref> proved that in these cases, the definition of (CjD) = 0 is robust under certain changes to Definition 2, most notably under relaxing (1) to the inequality d (w) (d (w0) + d (w1))=2, and under relaxing the limit condition in (2) to a limsup; viz. for all A 2 <p> It is shown in [15, 16, 2] that classes of measure zero behave very much like null-sets in classical measure theory. The complement (in D) of a measure-zero subclass C has (D) measure 1 (this is a definition in [15, 16] and a theorem in <ref> [21] </ref>). Finite unions, and also "(D)-bounded" countable unions, of measure-zero classes have measure zero. The operation of symmetric difference on languages, namely A 4 B = (A n B) [ (B n A), behaves like an "affine translation" in preserving measure: Proposition 4.

Reference-contexts: We also prove unconditionally that non-uniform AC 0 [2] is not measurable under either of the measures defined by Allender and Strauss [2]. We prove our theorems by showing that the martingales used in defining Lutz's measure theory yield natural properties, as defined by Razborov and Rudich <ref> [26] </ref>, of equivalent nonuniform complexity that diagonalize against (or "are useful against") the class C on which the martingale succeeds. An improvement of theorems in [26] due to Razborov [25] yields the conclusion. <p> We prove our theorems by showing that the martingales used in defining Lutz's measure theory yield natural properties, as defined by Razborov and Rudich <ref> [26] </ref>, of equivalent nonuniform complexity that diagonalize against (or "are useful against") the class C on which the martingale succeeds. An improvement of theorems in [26] due to Razborov [25] yields the conclusion. The main technical problem solved in our proof is that the martingales are defined on "characteristic prefixes" that define membership in a language L of all strings up to a given length n, whereas the natural properties concern length-n only. <p> Our solution appears to work only for non-uniform complexity. The natural properties produced by the martingales have greater density|1=n O (1) in place of 1=2 O (n) |than that postulated by Razborov and Rudich. We note that the first four main examples in <ref> [26] </ref> actually have density at least constant or 1 o (1), and all of them meet a stronger "a.e." condition of diagonalizing against every L 2 C at all but finitely many lengths, not just infinitely many lengths. <p> Let C denote any of NP, coNP, p p k , P/poly, nonuniform NC, BPP, PP, or PSPACE. Then (CjEXP) = 1 () C = EXP () C " co-C = EXP. 5 2.3. Natural Proofs The technical concept at the heart of the paper by Razborov and Rudich <ref> [26] </ref> is the following. For each n, let F n denote the set of n-variable Boolean functions; i.e., functions from f0; 1g n to f0; 1g. Then kF n k = 2 N , where N = 2 n . <p> When C is closed under finite variations, this is equivalent to diagonalizing i.o. against C: (8B 2 C)(9 1 n) B =n =2 n : (3) We remark that all of the natural properties constructed in <ref> [26] </ref> satisfy the stronger condition (8B 2 C)(8 1 n) B =n =2 n : (4) We call this diagonalizing a.e. against C. <p> Finally, the property is large if there exists a polynomial p such that for all but finitely many n, ( n ) = 2 N p (N ) Put another way, the Boolean functions in n have non-negligible density in the space of all Boolean functions. Definition 3 (cf. <ref> [26] </ref>). Let C and D be complexity classes of languages. A combinatorial property is D-natural against C if is large, belongs to D, and diagonalizes over C. Rudich and Razborov show that several important separation results in complexity use techniques that construct natural properties. <p> do not exist. (b) There does not exist a combinatorial property that is qAC 0 -natural against AC 0 [2], where qAC 0 denotes the class of languages accepted by a quasipolynomial size circuit family of constant depth. (In Appendix 1, we sketch the needed changes to the proofs in <ref> [26] </ref>, which are not given by Razborov in [25], nor in [27]. These were discovered independently, but later, by us.) 6 3. Main Results To prove our main theorem, we show that if (P/polyjEXP) = 0, then one can build a natural property that diagonalizes over P/poly. <p> Lemma 8 will guarantee that the density of these poor branches is at least 1=n 2 = 1=(log 2 N ), a notably greater density than that called "large" in <ref> [26] </ref>. Lemma 9. <p> Let d (w) be computable in time 2 (log jwj) c on inputs w. Let a PSRG G : f0; 1g k ! f0; 1g2k be given. Given fl, take " &lt; fl, and take n = k "=c . (In <ref> [26] </ref>, with a P/poly-natural property, they have c = 1.) Recall the construction of "G y (x)" in [26, 7], and of the pseudorandom function generator defined by f x (y) = the first bit of G y (x). <p> Let a PSRG G : f0; 1g k ! f0; 1g2k be given. Given fl, take " &lt; fl, and take n = k "=c . (In [26], with a P/poly-natural property, they have c = 1.) Recall the construction of "G y (x)" in <ref> [26, 7] </ref>, and of the pseudorandom function generator defined by f x (y) = the first bit of G y (x). Here jxj = k and jyj = n, and x can be thought of as "advice" to compute the pseudorandom function f in time polynomial in n. <p> In this section, we prove a partial converse of Theorem 17. Our results emphasize that two parameters in the definition of natural properties that are somewhat submerged in <ref> [26, 27] </ref> are very important: the density ( n ) of the property , that is, k n k=kF n k, and whether diagonalizes i.o. or a.e. (see Equations 3 and 4). Our results here seem to need somewhat stronger closure properties of the class D. <p> The languages L involved are defined by non-uniform sequences of seeds x for the "amplified generator" f x = G x (y) defined from G in <ref> [26, 7] </ref>. These seeds define the circuits C n in our key Lemma 9. The selection of sequences C n in Lemma 9 is non-uniform, however. <p> We leave 15 this as an interesting problem, and also leave the problem of whether the existence of secure PSRGs implies that NP does not have measure zero in E. We have shown that there is much ground for a deeper investigation into details of the natural-proofs theory of <ref> [26] </ref>, in terms of the size of the properties and whether the diagonalization is i.o. or a.e. This may have further ramifications for the connections to formal systems shown by Razborov [25].

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the journal version <ref> [27] </ref> of their paper adopts the "a.e." definition, by inserting a clause "for all sufficiently large n" into the conference version's definition of "useful." Both the "i.o." and the "a.e." conditions are important in this paper, and our work below on going from natural proofs to martingales brings out the significance <p> that is qAC 0 -natural against AC 0 [2], where qAC 0 denotes the class of languages accepted by a quasipolynomial size circuit family of constant depth.

Reference-contexts: If is merely i.o. diagonalizing, then the above factor seems insufficient. By a modification of the Borel-Cantelli lemma as applied to martingales [15] (see also <ref> [28] </ref>), it can be shown that if P n (1 ( n )) converges, then a successful martingale of equivalent nonuni form complexity can be constructed.
