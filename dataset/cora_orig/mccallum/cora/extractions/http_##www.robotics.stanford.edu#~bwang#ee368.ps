Abstract: This work describes an algorithm which automatically annotates fine art images with a set of pre-specified keywords, based on the supervised color classification of pixels into N pre-specified classes using simple pixel-wise operations first and followed by region segmentation. This algorithm extends Saber's pixel-based approach published in 1996 to a region-based operator. The class of each pixel is determined by using the conditional distribution of the chrominance components of pixels belonging to each class. A two-dimensional Gaussian function models the conditional distribution for each class, where the mean vectors and the covariance matrices are estimated from appropriate training sets. For a given fine art image, adaptive thresholds are determined by using the statistics for each class and the universal thresholds from training data. A succession of binary hypothesis tests are then utilized to decide whether a particular pixel belongs to any of the classes with adaptive thresholds. The maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) is then employed for those pixels belonging to more than one class to resolve the ambiguity. Region-based segmentation is performed on the edge-enhanced image which is the gradient image using the result of color pixel classification. A simple linker connects continuous edges and defines isolated regions by boundaries. The significant area of a region may correspond to the face in the portrait images or the sky in the outdoor scene images.

Reference-contexts: A color segmentation algorithm is described for extracting regions of N pre-specified classes from a classic fine art image. Saber et al. <ref> [1] </ref> presented a pixel-based approach to the annotation of natural scene images that uses a simple color classifier on pixels to indicate the presence of skin, sky and grass in an image. <p> In contrast, a large value of i g is "far" from the center and pixel g's probability of belonging to W i is small. 5 3 Region-Based Classification This section combines the pixel-based classification algorithm developed by Saber et al. <ref> [1] </ref> and the follow-up technique proposed here. The structure of this classifier is discussed. Then, the adaptive pixel classification algorithm is described. <p> Therefore, pixel g is classified to the class of the highest conditional probability and this is known as the maximum likelihood (ML) rule. 3.2 Algorithm Saber et al. <ref> [1] </ref> illustrated their algorithm by setting N = 3, which means that classes of skin, sky and grass were selected for natural scene images. In general, colors to express "grass" in the natural scene image are more predictable in the ES domain.
