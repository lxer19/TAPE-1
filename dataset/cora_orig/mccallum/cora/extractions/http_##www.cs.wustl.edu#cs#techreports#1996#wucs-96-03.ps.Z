Abstract: This paper considers the problem of designing ATM networks that are nonblocking with respect to virtual circuit requests, subject to specified constraints on the traffic. In this paper, we focus on global traffic constraints that simply limit the total entering and exiting traffic at each switching system. After reviewing prior results for linear link costs, we introduce a more realistic link cost model, and develop a number of results using it. We also describe a technique for converting tree-structured networks to nonblocking hierarchical networks satisfying limits on the capacity of any single switch

Reference-contexts: First, we prove an elementary lemma on the number of switches per region. We call a distribution of switches even if every region has between (1 *)n=R and (1 + *)n=R switches. The proof of lemma requires the following proposition due to Angluin and Valiant <ref> [1] </ref>) on the tail probabilities of the binomial distribution. Let B (n; p) denote the binomial distribution. If x is a random variable with distribution B (n; p) then by definition P (x = k) = k p k (1 p) nk .

Reference-contexts: Thus, the more imbalanced the source/sink capacities become the further from optimal the star network becomes. These results are described in detail in <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. 4. Realistic Link Models The linear link cost model ignores the fact that communication links of different capacities must be constructed from a limited set of link types, each with its own capacity.

Reference-contexts: To ensure that blocking occurs only rarely, the network backbone must be dimensioned with sufficient bandwidth to allow it to carry both the normal day-to-day traffic and peak traffic loads that may arise from time-to-time. The network design problem is not a new one. References <ref> [8, 7, 12, 13] </ref> are representative of the recent published research in this area. However, ATM networks differ from telephone and classical data networks in several ways.

Reference-contexts: If one is willing to sacrifice optimality of the computed set of links in order to reduce the time then one can do so using a variant of an algorithm by Ibarra and Kim <ref> [9] </ref> for the knapsack problem. This algorithm can produce solutions which approximate the optimal as closely as possible, allowing a smooth trade-off between the desired accuracy and the time required for the computation. There is an alternative dynamic programming algorithm that can be preferable in some situations.

Reference-contexts: One is to replace the over-sized switches in the original design with a collection of smaller switches interconnected in such a way as to yield a nonblocking network which is functionally equivalent to the original switch. Classical techniques can be applied to carry out this strategy. See <ref> [11, 15, 16, 20, 21] </ref>. Another approach is to replace the tree with a hierarchical interconnection of switches with a similar interconnection structure. This process is illustrated in Figure 3.
