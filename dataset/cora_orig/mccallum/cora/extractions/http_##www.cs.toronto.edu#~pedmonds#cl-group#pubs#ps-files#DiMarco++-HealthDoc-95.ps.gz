Abstract: The HealthDoc project aims to provide a comprehensive approach to the customization of patient-information and health-education materials through the development of sophisticated natural language generation systems. We adopt a model of patient education that takes into account patient information ranging from simple medical data to complex cultural beliefs, so that our work provides both an impetus and testbed for research in multicultural health communication. We propose a model of language generation, `generation by selection and repair', that relies on a `master-document' representation that pre-determines the basic form and content of a text, yet is amenable to editing and revision for customization. The implementation of this model has so far led to the design of a sentence planner that integrates multiple complex planning tasks and a rich set of ontological and linguistic knowledge sources.

Reference-contexts: The upper model <ref> (Bateman 1990) </ref> is Penman's domain-independent conceptual hierarchy; we are using the standard one provided with the KPML system. The domain model is linked to the upper model, but its concepts are derived from the application domain.

Reference-contexts: Both projects are building upon the Penman system for language generation that was initially developed at the Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California (Penman Project 1989), and further developed as KPML (KOMET-Penman multilingual) at Institut f ur integrierte Publikations- und Information-systeme, Gesellschaft f ur Mathematik und Datenverar-beitung, Darmstadt <ref> (Bateman 1995) </ref>. 3 The conceptual framework of the HealthDoc project The HealthDoc project aims to develop techniques for producing health-information and patient-education material that is customized to the personal and medical characteristics of the individual patient receiving it.

Reference-contexts: For example, Strecher and colleagues sent unsolicited leaflets to patients of family practices on topics such as giving up smoking (Strecher et al. 1994), improving dietary be-haviour <ref> (Campbell et al. 1994) </ref>, or having a mammogram (Skinner, Strecher, and Hospers 1994). Each leaflet was `tailored' to the recipient, on the basis of data gathered from them in an earlier survey.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, there is an increasing tendency to involve the author or the user in the production process. For example, in the IDAS project (Reiter, Mellish, and Levine 1992) and the Piglet project <ref> (Cawsey, Binsted, and Jones 1995) </ref>, the user's navigation through a hypertext strongly influences the selection of the content that is generated. In the Drafter project (Paris et al. 1995), the author chooses the information that is to be generated multilingually.

Reference-contexts: fewer inferences from it (Joyce 1994); if the patient is a male of Chinese ethnicity, we could assume that he believes that good health is more a matter of luck rather than his own behaviour, whereas if he is of Caribbean origin we could assume that he believes the converse <ref> (Dickinson and Bhatt 1994) </ref>. Ethnicity and culture are particularly interesting and difficult variables here. Our partner hospitals serve large, multi-ethnic, multicultural communities, and intercultural communicationindeed, the practice of multicultural health care in generalis a continuing problem for them.

Reference-contexts: For example, health messages that attempt to arouse high amounts of fear are effective on people with low anxiety, but less so on people with high anxiety (Hale and Dillard 1995); similarly, anti-drug messages are more effective when matched to the individual's degree of need for sensation <ref> (Donohew, Palmgreen, and Lorch 1994) </ref>. our own construction, such as Advice to patients on procedures for total head replacement.

Reference-contexts: Despite its name, the discourse-rank information is used by the sentence planner to recognize how two sentences could be aggregated, or to recognize relations between different clauses within one sentence. The information consists of a discourse-structure relation network <ref> (Hovy et al. 1992) </ref>, made up of three parallel subnetworks, each corresponding to a systemic-linguistic metafunction: ideational, textual, and interpersonal. In addition, a fourth subnetwork determines possible variations in the syntactic realization of different discourse-structure relations; this network corresponds to the logical systemic metafunction.

Reference-contexts: The design and development of this tool will be part of a later phase of the project, when the master document is represented as text plans. In the interim, for master documents of SPL sentence plans, an SPL authoring tool, Splat, has been developed <ref> (Jakeway 1995) </ref>. Use of this tool requires a familiarity with SPL. Splat permits an example-based approach to authoring. The user may view sample sentences, stored in a sentence bank, of previously constructed SPL plans, and can select part or all of a sentence to retrieve the appropriate SPL.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if the patient is elderly, we could, by default, draw on the observation that the elderly tend to exercise more rational thought when reading a text, but draw fewer inferences from it <ref> (Joyce 1994) </ref>; if the patient is a male of Chinese ethnicity, we could assume that he believes that good health is more a matter of luck rather than his own behaviour, whereas if he is of Caribbean origin we could assume that he believes the converse (Dickinson and Bhatt 1994).

Reference-contexts: Generalizations must not become stereotypes, and must thus be used with caution ; at the same time, some generalizations are necessary (Masi 1993: 21). There has been surprisingly little research on methods of achieving effective intercultural communication in health care; the state of the art <ref> (e.g., Kreps and Ku-nimoto 1994) </ref> is to try to make health-care practitioners aware of the need for cultural sensitivity, so that they can find out about the health-related characteristics of other cultures and then apply their common sense in any particular situation.

Reference-contexts: The domain model, as yet, contains only the specific concepts derived from our sample master documents; we will not attempt to create a full medical ontology. (Several groups are developing such knowledge bases from the Unified Medical Language System <ref> (Lindbergh, Humphreys, and McCray 1993) </ref>, and we expect to use their results) The linguistic knowledge sources are organized in terms of system networks; that is, they are fully expressed by a set of features organized into a network of choices.

Reference-contexts: Recognizing this, health educators have paid much attention to methods of identifying different segments of their audience and their differing needs and constructing material accordingly <ref> (see, e.g., many of the papers in Maibach and Parrott 1995) </ref>, but at some level, the material remains generic.

Reference-contexts: There can be more variation between individuals in a single ethnocultural group than between canonical members of different groups, and socio-economic class is a better predictor of health beliefs and behaviours than ethnocultural group is <ref> (Masi 1988) </ref>. Generalizations must not become stereotypes, and must thus be used with caution ; at the same time, some generalizations are necessary (Masi 1993: 21).

Reference-contexts: Our partner hospitals serve large, multi-ethnic, multicultural communities, and intercultural communicationindeed, the practice of multicultural health care in generalis a continuing problem for them. Cultures differ widely in their health beliefs and attitudes, and intercultural health communication can often be very difficult for practitioners <ref> (Masi 1993) </ref>. Often, it simply fails: Ineffective intercultural communication in health care can and often does result in unnecessary pain, suffering, and death (Kreps and Kunimoto 1994: 8). So tailoring by culture or ethnicity seems to be an ideal application of the customization of health information.

Reference-contexts: Many studies have shown that the `same' message often needs to be framed or presented in very different ways in order to be communicated most effectively and most persuasively to different people; indeed, what may be persuasive to one person can actually reduce compliance in another <ref> (Monahan 1995) </ref>. In health education, individual differences in health beliefs, perception of and attitude to risk, and level of education are among the factors that must be considered when tailoring a message to an individual.

Reference-contexts: But no simple fixed set of priorities for planning tasks is possible; sometimes, one might have to take precedence, and sometimes another. This consideration suggests that a blackboard architecture would be most appropriate for our purposes. A blackboard architecture generally consists of three major parts <ref> (Nii 1989) </ref>: the blackboard, a passive data structure that records the current stage of the problem-solving process; the processes that operate on the blackboard; and the control mechanism. The planning modules will operate in parallel, communicating via the blackboard and none constraining the others.

In addition to these four main knowledge sources, information about the individual patient is also available to influence the form of the output.
