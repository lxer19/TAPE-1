Title: Employing Linear Regression in Regression Tree Leaves  
Author: Aram Karalic

Affiliation: Jozef Stefan Institute,  
Abstract: The advantage of using linear regression in the leaves of a regression tree is analysed in the paper. It is carried out how this modification affects the construction, pruning and interpretation of a regression tree. The modification is tested on artificial and real-life domains. The results show that the modification is beneficial as it leads to smaller classification errors of induced regression trees. Keywords: machine learning, TDIDT, regression, linear regression, Bayesian approach.

Reference-contexts: A regression tree actually implements a function y (x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n ) of n continuous or discrete attributes. In the basic CART algorithm for the construction of regression trees <ref> [1] </ref>, the class value in the leaves of a tree is estimated as a constant function.

Reference-contexts: Here, M is a predictor which always predicts the mean value of the training example set. Bayesian Approach Bayesian approach to estimating class distribution in the tree-structured regression is based on Good's notion of Bayesian analysis <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: More about the domains and previous work can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. Experiment for each domain consisted of 10 repetitions of the sequence: 1. Split the set of all examples into learning example set and testing example set in proportion 70 : 30. 2. Construct a tree using learning examples and m = 0. 3.

Reference-contexts: Here, M is a predictor which always predicts the mean value of the training example set. Bayesian Approach Bayesian approach to estimating class distribution in the tree-structured regression is based on Good's notion of Bayesian analysis [2]. The application of the approach to tree-structured regression was developed in <ref> [4] </ref>, and is used in our experiments because the approach introdues parameter m, which enables us to adapt the algorithm of tree building and post-pruning to the expected level of noise in learning examples. 3 Local Linear Regression (LLR) The definition of a leaf of a regression tree is extended in

Reference-contexts: Function g represents the regression plane through the examples. LLR During Post-Pruning of a Regression Tree For post-pruning of generated regression trees an algorithm based on the Niblett-Bratko post-pruning method <ref> [5] </ref> was used. Pruning is based on estimation of the classification error on test examples.
