Abstract: Technical Report #1035 August 1991 Abstract We present an approach for recovering surface shape from the occluding contour using an active (i.e., moving) observer. It is based on a relation between the geometries of a surface in a scene and its occluding contour: If the viewing direction of the observer is along a principal direction for a surface point whose projection is on the contour, surface shape (i.e., curvature) at the surface point can be recovered from the contour. Unlike previous approaches for recovering shape from the occluding contour, we use an observer that purposefully changes viewpoint in order to achieve a well-defined geometric relationship with respect to a 3D shape prior to its recognition. We show that there is a simple and efficient viewing strategy that allows the observer to align their viewing direction with one of the two principal directions for a point on the surface. This strategy depends on only curvature measurements on the occluding contour and therefore demonstrates that recovering quantitative shape information from the contour does not require knowledge of the velocities or accelerations of the observer. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be easily implemented and can provide reliable shape information from the occluding contour.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There has been considerable interest in recovering information about the structure of a scene from sequences of images, assuming an observer in motion (e.g., work on optical flow <ref> [1] </ref> and shape-from-motion [2]).

Recently, however, there has been considerable interest in employing simple observer behaviors that either make the recovery of scene properties easier [4, 5, 6], or combine simple behaviors in order to perform complex tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance [7, 8, 9, 10]. <p> On the other hand, approaches that derive quantitative shape descriptions from the occluding contour assume that additional information is available in order to adequately constrain the shape recovery process <ref> [22, 3, 14] </ref>.

The basic assumption used by all of the above approaches was that the viewing direction is arbitrary. <p> In fact k n and k o determine the second fundamental form at p.

The above results are important but they also imply that if we have no additional information about the shape of the viewed surface, the information provided by the occluding contour is primarily qualitative. <p> The reason is that if the surfaces are locally flat, surface points will enter and leave the rim at arbitrarily large rates. This problem will also exist for methods that measure image velocities in the vicinity of the rim (e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>), since they require that the image points or features are not widely separated on the surface. * Eq.

The occluding contour is the projection of the visible rim, the one-dimensional set of points that separates the visible from the hidden parts of a surface. There have been several approaches to deriving information about surface geometry from the occluding contour. <p> This means that the viewing direction is not related in any way to the geometry of the rim or the occluding contour. (For example, there are surfaces for which their rim is planar when viewed from a particular set of directions <ref> [17] </ref>.) This is a reasonable approach, however, only if the observer cannot control their direction of gaze. When the observer has the ability to control their viewing direction, the choice of viewpoint (s) does not have to be arbitrary. <p> This means that the viewing direction is not related in any way to the geometry of the rim or the occluding contour. For example, there are surfaces for which their rim is planar when viewed from a particular set of directions <ref> [17] </ref>. The assumption that the direction of gaze is arbitrary immediately excludes such viewpoints from consideration since the rim is not always planar [26]. This is a reasonable assumption, however, only if the observer cannot control their direction of gaze. <p> However, there are surfaces for which the local shape of a single rim point reveals global properties of the surface. Surfaces of revolution present an ideal example of such surfaces. The properties and appearance of surfaces of revolution and their generalizations have been studied extensively <ref> [27, 25, 29, 17, 30, 31, 28, 18] </ref>. Here, we focus on the specific relation between their global structure and the local shape of points on the rim. Surfaces of revolution are formed by rotating a planar curve around a straight axis that does not meet the curve. <p> Therefore, we can completely describe a surface of revolution by the axis and the generating curve. Approaches for recovering the axis of a surface of revolution have been mainly geared towards detecting symmetries in their occluding contour or outline <ref> [17] </ref>, or utilizing their viewpoint-invariant properties [29, 30, 32]. The problem with detecting symmetries in the occluding contour is that the existence of such symmetries depends on viewpoint. On the other hand, the identification, detection and utilization of viewpoint 18 invariant properties is a non-trivial task.

Local surface shape (i.e., curvature) is completely expressed by the first and second fundamental forms of S with respect to x <ref> [25, 26] </ref>. Specifically, let N (p) : S ! S 2 be the Gauss map of S, assigning a unit normal vector N (p) in the direction of the vector product x u ^ x v at every point p 2 S. <p> For example, there are surfaces for which their rim is planar when viewed from a particular set of directions [17]. The assumption that the direction of gaze is arbitrary immediately excludes such viewpoints from consideration since the rim is not always planar <ref> [26] </ref>. This is a reasonable assumption, however, only if the observer cannot control their direction of gaze. Unfortunately we can only derive a limited amount of information from the occluding contour when this assumption is in effect. <p> However, when the observer can actively control their viewing direction, they can exploit the existence of directions that allow the derivation of complete information about the surface. We show this by presenting three simple corollaries to a result of Blaschke <ref> [26] </ref>. Blaschke's result is analogous to Euler's formula and relates the curvature of the occluding contour with the principal curvatures of S at the rim: Theorem 1. (Blaschke) Let be the angle between ~ and e 1 . Then, k 1 n 1 sin 2 + k 1 Corollary 1. <p> maximum values only when ~ coincides with one of the principal directions. (2) If p is hyperbolic, k o (~) is well-defined only when jj &lt; arctan r k n 2 1 The corollaries also hold for e 2 and k n 2 . 2 This is also mentioned in <ref> [26] </ref>. 10 jj &lt; arctan r k n 2 for . For these directions, k o (~) takes its maximum value when ~ coincides with e 1 and it has no minimum value. Proof: If ~ is along e 1 , = 0 in Eq. (2). Corollary 1 immediately follows. <p> The other principal direction is also computable since e 2 must lie on T p (S) and be perpendicular to ~. In fact, ~ is perpendicular to the rim even though this does not hold in general <ref> [26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These curves are called lines of curvature and their properties are intrinsically related to the underlying surface. Therefore they serve as a natural basis for describing a surface <ref> [27, 28] </ref>. In the rest of the paper x will refer to such a parameterization. The geometry of a point on the occluding contour and the information we can derive from it depends on whether the point is a projection of an elliptic, hyperbolic or parabolic point. <p> This is because, by definition, T p (S) contains both ~ and the tangent to the occluding contour [13]. * Let k o be the curvature of the occluding contour at q. Then k o and the Gaussian curvature K of S at p have the same sign <ref> [16, 27] </ref>. * If k n is the normal curvature of S at p along ~, then K = k n k o [16, 27, 14]. <p> Then k o and the Gaussian curvature K of S at p have the same sign [16, 27]. * If k n is the normal curvature of S at p along ~, then K = k n k o <ref> [16, 27, 14] </ref>. Similar results hold for perspective projection where the plane of projection is not positioned at infinity, and for the case where k o = 0 [27]. <p> Similar results hold for perspective projection where the plane of projection is not positioned at infinity, and for the case where k o = 0 <ref> [27] </ref>. Because K is defined as the product of two curvatures on the surface (i.e., k n 1 ; k n 2 ), these results suggest that if we know k o then we only 9 need to measure one curvature on the surface instead of two. <p> However, there are surfaces for which the local shape of a single rim point reveals global properties of the surface. Surfaces of revolution present an ideal example of such surfaces. The properties and appearance of surfaces of revolution and their generalizations have been studied extensively <ref> [27, 25, 29, 17, 30, 31, 28, 18] </ref>. Here, we focus on the specific relation between their global structure and the local shape of points on the rim. Surfaces of revolution are formed by rotating a planar curve around a straight axis that does not meet the curve.

Therefore, the axis of rotation (as well as the generating curve) can be recovered by simply using existing symmetry-seeking approaches (e.g., <ref> [29] </ref>) which are well-defined for such a viewpoint. However, the direction and position of the axis can also be constrained by recovering the principal curvatures corresponding to the parallels for two points on the rim of a side view (Figure 9 (b)).

Reference-contexts: The occluding contour of the model for the current viewing direction was displayed and updated as the viewing direction changed smoothly. The system allows interactive rotation of an object with a single degree of freedom <ref> [33] </ref>. Therefore, viewing direction changes were constrained to lie on a predetermined plane . In our examples this plane is defined by a horizontal line in the image plane and the viewing direction (i.e., the projection of this plane to the image plane is a horizontal line).

Reference-contexts: Computing the curvature of a piecewise linear curve is a non-trivial problem; our goal however, was only to estimate how the curvature at the selected points varies with viewpoint. For this purpose, the occluding contour in the vicinity of the detected points was approximated with cubic B-splines <ref> [34] </ref> and the curvature was measured at the points where the tangent to the spline was horizontal. Even though splines have the effect of smoothing high curvature parts of a curve, we found that even with the actual rim curvatures being underestimated the curvature maxima were very distinct.
