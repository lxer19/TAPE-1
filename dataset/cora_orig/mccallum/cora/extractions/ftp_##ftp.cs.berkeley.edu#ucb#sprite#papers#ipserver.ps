Abstract: M.S. Project Report Computer Science Division Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California Berkeley, California 94720 Abstract suite for the Sprite network operating system . The Sprite implementation is based on the 4.3BSD kernel implementation, but most of the code is placed in a user-level process called the IP server. Compared to a kernel-level implementation, a user-level implementation is simpler to debug and test but performance is adversely affected. Throughput performance of TCP on Sprite is about 25% of 4.3BSD TCP throughput using the same hardware. TCP latency on Sprite is about 14 times 4.3BSD's latency. 4.3BSD socket compatibility is achieved with a set of library routines that emulate socket system calls. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
