Abstract: The AAAI Fall Symposium; Flexible Computation in Intelligent Systems: Results, Issues, and Opportunities. Nov. 9-11, 1996, Cambridge, MA Abstract This paper presents a case-based reasoning system TA3. We address the flexibility of the case-based reasoning process, namely flexible retrieval of relevant experiences, by using a novel similarity assessment theory. To exemplify the advantages of such an approach, we have experimentally evaluated the system and compared its performance to the performance of non-flexible version of TA3 and to other machine learning algorithms on several domains.

Reference-contexts: Besides specifying a context, a user can state criteria which define the way the context is handled and what criteria should be used for matching during context relaxation and restriction. Thus, context permits easy implementation of retrieval by reformulation <ref> (Devanbu et al. 1991) </ref> and allows for iterative browsing through contextually similar cases. When the problem of specifying query gets hard, retrieval by reformulation is the best approach, which is the motivation for supporting efficient iterative browsing.

Reference-contexts: Deploying Telos (Mylopoulos et al. 1990) representation language allows for treating objects (cases) and their attributes uniformly and thus diminishing problems discussed earlier <ref> (Dierbach & Chester 1991) </ref>. In addition, it allows for lowering the impact of irrelevant attributes on system performance (Aha 1992; Ortega 1995). Categories allow for improved system performance (Jurisica & Glasgow 1995; Jurisica & Shapiro 1995; Jurisica & Glasgow 1996a).

Reference-contexts: If no priority is explicitly assigned then the last category is assumed to be the least important. Category priorities are defined using either the knowledge discovery algorithm or are specified by the user. As pointed out in <ref> (Gaasterland 1993) </ref>, the relaxation technique can advantageously be used for returning answer to a specific query as well as returning related answers. Without such automatic relaxation, users would need to submit alternative queries themselves.

Reference-contexts: Thus, TA3 can be tuned for a particular application or a specific user. Using the terminology of normative rationality introduced in <ref> (Good 1952) </ref>, medical application of the T A3 system follows type I rationality, i.e., inference that is consistent with the axioms of decision theory regardless of the cost of inference. Robotic application of T A3 implements type II rationality, where the cost of reasoning is considered.

Reference-contexts: By changing the context, one can change the relevance measure flexibly. Relevance of cases to a given request can be measured using various approaches. However, there is little commonality between definitions of relevance used in different systems <ref> (Greiner 1994) </ref>, except when relevance is defined as usefulness. Since the usefulness of individual attributes varies, we define context as a set of attributes, relevant for a given retrieval.

Reference-contexts: In many processes, it is better to retrieve fewer cases, or none, than to retrieve less useful cases that would result in a poor solution. In some situations, an accurate solution is required, with minimal concern on resources needed <ref> (Jurisica & Shapiro 1995) </ref>. In other situations, time resources may be limited (e.g., during computing inverse kinematic task in robotics (Jurisica & Glasgow 1995)) and thus the system should allow for less accurate result but within time constraints. <p> In some situations, an accurate solution is required, with minimal concern on resources needed (Jurisica & Shapiro 1995).

Reference-contexts: This allows for a more controlled retrieval process, as well as for easy context modifications. This notion of context subsumes traditional nearest-neighbor or template matching in CBR systems <ref> (Kolodner 1993) </ref>, where the partial description of a case is submitted as the query and the system locates all cases similar to a given description. Our approach allows for initiating the query by using query-by-example; however, using context allows for subsequent controlled modifications.

Reference-contexts: For a domain value constraint, the attribute value in the source case must be an instance of the attribute value in the context. 2. Cardinality constraints specify the number of attributes required to match for a particular category, similarly as m of n matching in <ref> (Ortega 1995) </ref>. Exact specifies that all attributes in the category of a source case and the interpretation of the target case must match. Some (m) determines that not all attributes in a category are required to match, but at least m of n attributes must match the context.

Reference-contexts: Some (m) determines that not all attributes in a category are required to match, but at least m of n attributes must match the context. It should be noted that Exact = Some (n). 3. Schema constraints are used for schema integration (Kashyap & Sheth 1993) and analogical inference <ref> (Vosniadou & Ortony 1989) </ref>. Two matching strategies are supported AttributeMode and MapMode. The first requires that both attribute name and attribute value match; the latter allows for matching if only the value matches.
