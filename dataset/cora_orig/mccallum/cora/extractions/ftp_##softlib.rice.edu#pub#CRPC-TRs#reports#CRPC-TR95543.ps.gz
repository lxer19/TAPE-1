Abstract: In this work we define a trust-region feasible-point algorithm for approximating solutions of the nonlinear system of equalities and inequalities F (x; y) = 0; y 0, where F : IR n fi IR m ! IR p is continuously differentiable. This formulation is quite general; the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of a general nonlinear programming problem are an obvious example, and a set of equalities and inequalities can be transformed, using slack variables, into such form. We will be concerned with the possibility that n, m, and p may be large and that the Jacobian matrix may be sparse and rank deficient. Exploiting the convex structure of the local model trust-region subproblem, we propose a globally convergent inexact trust-region feasible-point algorithm to minimize an arbitrary norm of the residual, say kF (x; y)k a , subject to the nonnegativity constraints. This algorithm uses a trust-region globalization strategy to determine a descent direction as an inexact solution of the local model trust-region subproblem and then, it uses linesearch techniques to obtain an acceptable steplength. We demonstrate that, under rather weak hypotheses, any accumulation point of the iteration sequence is a constrained stationary point for f = kF k a , and that the sequence of constrained residuals converges to zero. 1. Introduction. In this paper we consider the problem of solving the nonlinear system of

Reference-contexts: f = kF k a is regular, i.e. at any z and in any direction w in IR n fi IR m , its generalized directional derivative, denoted by f 0 (z; w), and its one-sided directional derivative, denoted by f 0 (z; w), exist and are equal (see Clarke <ref> [2] </ref>). They are respectively defined by (2.1) f 0 (z; w) = lim sup f (z 0 + tw) f (z 0 ) and t#0 t For more details concerning properties of the various derivatives of f = kF k a , we refer the reader to Clarke [2]. <p> (see Clarke <ref> [2] </ref>).

In this research, we use both derivatives althought they are equal. To study the optimality conditions, working with the one-sided directional derivative is sufficient.
