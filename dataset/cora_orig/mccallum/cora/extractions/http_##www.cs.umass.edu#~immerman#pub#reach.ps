Title: Reachability and the Power of Local Ordering

Abstract: The L ? = NL question remains one of the major unresolved problems in complexity theory. Both L and NL have logical characterizations as the sets of totally ordered () structures expressible in first-order logic augmented with the appropriate Transitive Closure operator [I87]: (FO + DTC+ ) captures L and (FO+TC+ ) captures NL. On the other hand, in the absence of ordering, (FO + TC) is strictly more powerful than (FO + DTC) [GM92]. An apparently quite different "structured" model of logspace machines is the Jumping Automaton on Graphs (JAG), [CR80]. We show that the JAG model is intimately related to these logics on "one-way locally ordered" (1LO) structures. We argue that the usual JAG model is unreasonably weak and should be replaced, wherever possible, by the two-way JAG model, which we define. Furthermore, the language (FO + DTC + 2LO) over two-way locally ordered (2LO) graphs is more robust than even the two-way JAG model, and yet lower bounds remain accessible. We prove an upper bound on the power of TC over one-way locally ordered graphs, and three lower bounds on DTC.

Reference-contexts: The later model is able to search all trees and is much more robust than the traditional one-way JAG. Our main lower bounds build on the lower bounds in [CR80] and in <ref> [BS77] </ref>. We show that DTC of first-order formulas in the language (FO + DTC + 1LO) does not suffice to express reachability. We also show that DTC of first-order formulas does not suffice to express reachability for two-way local ordered graphs without numbers.

Reference-contexts: The following lower bound involves locally consistent two-way local orderings, but the graphs in question curve around themselves rather than being embeddable in Z 3 . See also <ref> [BH92] </ref> for a related lower bound. Fact 6.2 ([CR80]) No finite state JAG can search all degree three undirected graphs. Corollary 6.3 The reachability problem for undirected graphs equipped with two-way local orderings is not expressible in the form DTC ('), with ' first-order and without numbers.

Reference-contexts: Attempts to extend this proof to separate the languages with ordering and thus separate L from NL remain unsuccessful. An apparently quite different "structured" model of logspace machines is the Jumping Automaton on Graphs (JAG), <ref> [CR80] </ref>. It is known that the JAG model is not powerful enough to search all graphs. This may be considered as some evidence that L 6= NL. <p> The later model is able to search all trees and is much more robust than the traditional one-way JAG. Our main lower bounds build on the lower bounds in <ref> [CR80] </ref> and in [BS77]. We show that DTC of first-order formulas in the language (FO + DTC + 1LO) does not suffice to express reachability. We also show that DTC of first-order formulas does not suffice to express reachability for two-way local ordered graphs without numbers. <p> Note that the JAG defined in <ref> [CR80] </ref> is a non-uniform model. We modify the definition here exactly so that the model is uniform: Definition 3.3 [JAG]A uniform Jumping Automaton on Graphs (JAG) is a logspace Turing machine that accesses its input via a bounded number of pebbles. <p> Thus J simulates and accepts iff it reachs a situation where x 0 = t 2 To prove our lower bound on (FO + DTC + 1LO) we use the following fact from <ref> [CR80] </ref>. Fact 5.4 ([CR80]) No JAG can decide s-t-reachability on forests. Theorem 5.5 No formula = [DTC x; x 0 (')] expresses s-t-reachability on one-way locally ordered DAGs. 6 Lower Bound: (FO + DTC + 2LO) It is harder to prove a lower bound on two-way locally ordered graphs.

Both of these facts appear in <ref> [EI94b] </ref> and are discussed further in Section 7. 4 Two-Way Locally Ordered Graphs The feature of the JAG model that makes it unrealistically weak is its inability to back up. <p> What remained to be shown to prove this conjecture was that the language (FO + TC + COUNT) canonizes all trees, cf. [IL90, L92]. However, we have recently <ref> [EI94b] </ref> proven that tree canonization is not in (FO + TC + COUNT) and, using the result of [L92], this yields that (FO + TC + COUNT + 1LO) 6= NL.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, in the absence of ordering, (FO + TC) is strictly more powerful than (FO + DTC) <ref> [GM92] </ref> (We include a simple proof of this result which applies also to the stronger language fl Both authors were supported by NSF grant CCR-9207797. 1 (FO + DTC + COUNT) in which counting quantifiers are present.). <p> expressible over non-ordered structures even in (FO + COUNT + ATC) and thus not in (FO + COUNT + TC) nor (FO + COUNT + DTC) either. 2.1 Separation of TC Logics Without Ordering It is known that the language (FO + TC) is more powerful than (FO + DTC) <ref> [GM92] </ref>. Here we give a particularly simple proof of this fact and also note that the proof goes through in the presence of counting. Theorem 2.7 Reachability from s to t is expressible in (FO+ TC); but, not in (FO+ DTC), nor even in (FO + DTC + COUNT).

Reference-contexts: For example, on a graph with no edges, even (FO + ATC) is powerless to walk through the vertices and so cannot express the proposition that there is an odd number of vertices <ref> [I82] </ref>. On the other hand, the reason we would prefer not adding the ordering relation is that it allows the language to express order dependent properties, i.e., properties that depend not on the graph but rather on the arbitrary ordering in which the graph is presented.

Reference-contexts: Both L and NL have logical characterizations as the sets of ordered structures expressible in first-order logic augmented with the appropriate Transitive Closure operator <ref> [I87] </ref>. (FO + DTC+ ) captures L and (FO + TC+ ) captures NL. <p> We also show that DTC of first-order formulas does not suffice to express reachability for two-way local ordered graphs without numbers. A preliminary version of this paper appeared as [EI94a]. 2 Descriptive Complexity In this paper our notation follows the conventions of Descriptive Complexity. See <ref> [I87, I89] </ref> for more detail and motivation. We code all inputs as finite logical structures. <p> Fact 2.3 (<ref> [I87] </ref>) (FO + DTC+ ) = L Other transitive closure operators are interesting to consider. We briefly mention a third one: Alternating Transitive Closure (ATC) is the generalization of TC to and/or graphs. See [I87] for details. Fact 2.4 ([I87]) (FO + ATC+ ) = P Facts 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 do not go through for non-ordered structures. One reason for this is that these languages are overly weak when restricted to graphs without much structure. <p> We have the following relationships: (The relation BIT is mentioned in the following fact. We have avoided talking in detail about BIT because it is definable in (FO + DTC+ ) and above <ref> [I87] </ref>; and, thus is not needed in the remainder of this paper.) Fact 2.5 For totally ordered structures with BIT the following containments hold. <p> We must show that there is a sentence J 2 (FO + DTC) such that the set accepted by J is exactly the set of one-way locally ordered graphs that satisfy J . This is similar to the proof that L (FO + DTC+ ) <ref> [I87] </ref>. We will use a bounded number of numeric variables to code J 's O (log n) bit work tape. We will use a vertex variable v i to denote the vertex on which pebble p i sits. Thus jumping, and coincidence of pebbles is first-order. <p> There is a normal form theorem which says that every formula in (FO + DTC+ ) can be written in the form DTC ['](s; t) where ' is not only first-order, but quantifier-free, <ref> [I87] </ref>. This normal form theorem is false without ordering, even with two-way local ordering. However, we feel that a generalization of the proof of Theorem 5.5 will extend to a lower bound on all of (FO + DTC+1LO). 2.
