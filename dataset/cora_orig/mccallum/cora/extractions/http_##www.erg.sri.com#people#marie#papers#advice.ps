Note: How to Succeed in Graduate School: A Guide for Students and Advisors Submitted to Crossroads,  
Abstract: This paper attempts to raise some issues that are important for graduate students to be successful and to get as much out of the process as possible, and for advisors who wish to help their students be successful. The intent is not to provide prescriptive advice no formulas for finishing a thesis or twelve-step programs for becoming a better advisor are given but to raise awareness on both sides of the advisor-student relationship as to what the expectations are and should be for this relationship, what a graduate student should expect to accomplish, common problems, and where to go if the advisor is not forthcoming.

Reference-contexts: The topic of how to find a job, and how to prepare for the job search during graduate school, is the topic of <ref> [ Feibelman, 1993 ] </ref> . Graduate school is not an easy process, and too many students are thwarted and intimidated by unsupportive or unskilled advisors, lack of knowledge about what graduate school is all about, inflexible bureaucracies, and a myriad of other obstacles.

Reference-contexts: Low-level comments are more appropriate for a paper that is being submitted for publication than for an unpublished paper such as a proposal or description of preliminary research. See <ref> [ Parberry, 1989 ] </ref> for more suggestions on reviewing papers. 3.5 Getting Financial Support Most graduate students (at least in the natural sciences) have a source of financial support that pays their tuition and a small living stipend.
