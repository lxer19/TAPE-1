Abstract: The temporal structure of the force, or strain, signals from an internal force-torque sensor can be a rich source of information about robot/environment contact conditions. We present a procedure for representing and segmenting the individual signals with an auto-regressive model. This procedure produces segments of approximately constant spectrum, and is a powerful technique for detecting abrupt changes in noisy signals without prior calibration.

Reference-contexts: Humans are able to extract a great deal of information about the nature of the stick's contact from this signal <ref> [1] </ref>. Our research is aimed at developing techniques for providing a robot with a force-torque sensor and position sensors the same interpretational capabilities. This should be possible, because, although the measurement channels are different the same information is being measured by both the robot and the human hand.

Intrinsic Contact Sensing Intrinsic contact sensing is the measurement of information about the contact point from an internal, or intrinsic, force-torque sensor <ref> [2] </ref>. Our investigation used the sensor shown in figure 2. This sensor has a Maltese-cross connecting the outer shell to the base. The cross is instrumented with 8 strain-gauge half-bridges.

Reference-contexts: The fineness of the segmentation is controlled by the level of the decision parameter. This test is optimal if the two distributions for are known. Further details on this test and more powerful tests are given in <ref> [8] </ref>. In practice, we substitute the current value of ^ Q for Q in the test and run two simultaneous tests. One test looks for changes of size ffQ and the other test looks for changes of size Q=ff. ff is used as a design parameter. <p> Since the model order selector cannot reorder the regressors, no one order for the regressors will work in both cases. There are two possible remedies. First, additional models with different orderings can be run simultaneously and the optimal model can be chosen. This is the approach used in <ref> [8] </ref>. This has the advantage that a constant flat signal, which is generated in free space or while at rest, can be selected. Second, an eigenvalue decomposition of I can be performed to find the optimal regression directions. Unfortunately, both techniques are computationally expensive.

Reference-contexts: An 8 inch glass-epoxy link connects a brushless DC motor, with an integral reflection torque sensor, to the sensor. The output torque from the motor is controlled to one part in 1000 using an integral controller. The motor's design and control is described in <ref> [9] </ref>. The glass-epoxy link provides a very stiff, well damped linkage. Test specimens can be placed under the sensor or on blocks at the end of its travel. Both the angle and force measurement have 12 bits of resolution.
