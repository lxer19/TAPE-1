Title: Distributed Protocols for ID Assignment

Abstract: This paper considers distributed protocols for assigning IDs. Normally the maker of an RFID system would simply assign each ID sequentially in the factory, or the user would manually burn it in to EPROM. But it may be cheaper and simpler to manufacture units identically, and build the capability to become unique into each one. I describe three distributed protocols which make use of hardware random number generation to create unique IDs. In the first, trivial scheme, random IDs of sufficient length are independently chosen by all units. This requires no communication among the units, so it could be used to assign identities in circumstances in which central coordination or communication among the units is impossible. However, because no communication or central coordination is used, the IDs may be quite long. I then present a second protocol which requires a modest amount of communication to assign a set of unique, short IDs. Finally, I present a protocol with more substantial communication requirements that accomplishes the same ID assignment task in much less time.

Reference-contexts: The first well known symmetry breaking problem is the Dining Philosophers problem, posed in 1965 by Dijkstra <ref> [2] </ref>. In this problem, processes with overlapping resource requirements must be scheduled. The symmetry breaking problem arises when two processors try simultaneously to access the same resource: to break or avoid deadlock, one must yield.

Reference-contexts: These identities can then be used to break symmetry if desired, and for additional non-computational purposes such as communication. The one example in the computer science literature of using a symmetry breaking protocol to assign unique identities is a paper of Lipton and Park <ref> [4] </ref>, in which they pose what they call the Processor Identity Problem|fundamentally the same problem discussed in this paper, but set in the context of a shared memory multiprocessing system. The protocol they describe is of no use in the multiaccess-channel scenario we are considering.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a simple combinatorial argument shows that the probability of failure p f of the non-interacting protocol is p f = 1 (m n)!m n = 1 (2 T n)!2 T n There is a well known formula that bounds this probability; see for example Motwani <ref> [5] </ref> for a derivation. p f 1 e n (n1)=2m = 1 e n (n1)=2 T+1 Solving this inequality for T , we find T log 2 n 2 + n Assuming that we are interested in a small probability of failure, we can make the approximation ln (1 p f
