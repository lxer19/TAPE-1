Abstract: Berkeley Pascal is designed for interactive instructional use and runs on the PDP/11 and VAX/11 computers. Interpretive code is produced, providing fast translation at the expense of slower execution speed. There is also a fully compatible compiler for the VAX/11. An execution profiler and Wirth's cross reference program are also available with the system. The User's Manual gives a list of sources relating to the UNIX system, the Pascal language, and the Berkeley Pascal system. Basic usage examples are provided for the Pascal components pi , px , pix , pc , and pxp . Errors commonly encountered in these programs are discussed. Details are given of special considerations due to the interactive implementation. A number of examples are provided including many dealing with input/output. An appendix supplements Wirth's Pascal Report to form the full definition of the Berkeley implementation of the language.
