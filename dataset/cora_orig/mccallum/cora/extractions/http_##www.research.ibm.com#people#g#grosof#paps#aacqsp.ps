Reference-contexts: (Software today is mostly written using non-randomized control constructs.) The RAISE Project and Experience at IBM IBM has built a number of intelligent agents in different application areas, including information access, support of collaborative work, system management, workflow, adaptive user interfaces, customer service support, e-mail, desktop applications integration, and more. <ref> [1] </ref> gives an overview of these. The goal of our RAISE project at IBM Research is to create em-beddable technology to support a variety of intelligent agent applications, including ultimately as many as possible of those within IBM. RAISE stands for Reusable Agent Intelligence Software Environment.
