Title: The Information Manifold

Abstract: We describe the Information Manifold (IM), a system for browsing and querying of multiple networked information sources. As a first contribution, the system demonstrates the viability of knowledge representation technology for retrieval and organization of information from disparate (structured and unstructured) information sources. Such an organization allows the user to pose high-level queries that use data from multiple information sources. As a second contribution, we describe novel query processing algorithms used to combine information from multiple sources. In particular, our algorithms are guaranteed to find exactly the set of information sources relevant to a query, and to completely exploit knowledge about local closed world information (Etzioni et al. 1994).

Reference-contexts: For this language we show it is possible to efficiently and completely determine which information sources (or portions thereof) are relevant to a given query. In contrast, previous work (e.g., SIMS <ref> (Arens et al. 1994) </ref>) provided no guarantees of minimality of the number of information sources (or portions thereof) deemed relevant. Furthermore, SIMS modeled information sources using only a description logic. The expressive power of Horn rules is necessary in order to model information sources that are relational databases. <p> For retrieval actions that cannot be expressed as browsing operations, a query language allows one to express more complex queries, as described previously. Related Work The IM approach to retrieving and organizing information from disparate sources is related to the approach taken by systems such as SIMS <ref> (Arens et al. 1994) </ref> and Carnot (Collet et al. 1991), to work done in software agents (e.g., (Cohen et al. 1994)), as well as to work done in multidatabase systems. The work most closely related to ours is the SIMS project for integrating multiple information sources (Arens et al. 1994). <p> systems such as SIMS <ref> (Arens et al. 1994) </ref> and Carnot (Collet et al. 1991), to work done in software agents (e.g., (Cohen et al. 1994)), as well as to work done in multidatabase systems. The work most closely related to ours is the SIMS project for integrating multiple information sources (Arens et al. 1994). The representation of the domain in their system is based on the description logic system LOOM (MacGregor 1987). Answering a query in SIMS proceeds in two steps: finding the relevant sources and accessing them.

Reference-contexts: In particular, our techniques for answering queries make two contributions over previous related work: * The language for representing contents of information sources is a combination of Horn rules and concepts from the Classic description logic <ref> (Brachman et al. 1991) </ref>. For this language we show it is possible to efficiently and completely determine which information sources (or portions thereof) are relevant to a given query.

The work most closely related to ours is the SIMS project for integrating multiple information sources (Arens et al. 1994). <p> However, articulation axioms do not allow for the specification of the semantic contents of source relations, and hence there is no notion of optimizing queries in Carnot. Cohen et al. <ref> (Cohen et al. 1994) </ref> also use the language of Horn rules to represent the relationships between the contents of external sources and the domain model. However, they did not consider the issue of query optimization.

Another project related to ours is the Carnot project <ref> (Collet et al. 1991) </ref>, which has similar objectives to multidatabase systems in providing resource integration, global querying and global updates.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, our techniques for determining relevance are sufficiently general, such that we can incorporate Horn rules with more expressive description logics, consider queries involving negation, and statements describing rela tionships between the information sources. * Local closed world information (LCW), introduced in <ref> (Etzioni et al. 1994) </ref> enables us to express the fact that an information source has complete knowledge about some part of the domain. <p> Accessing all the information sources that are relevant to a query could thus involve retrieving information redundantly. Using the descriptions of information sources discussed in the previous section, there was no way to infer that subsequent queries to other information sources would be redundant. Etzioni et al. <ref> (Etzioni et al. 1994) </ref> describe a method for specifying that a source has locally complete knowledge about some aspect of the domain. Such knowledge can be used to exclude redundant information sources. <p> Then, the answer to a query is complete if and only if we have complete information about every portion C i of a domain relation E i that was deemed relevant. 2 In contrast, <ref> (Etzioni et al. 1994) </ref> showed that the if direction holds in general, without the restriction on the number of predicate occurrences. <p> In (Levy 1994), a sound and complete inference procedure for determining completeness of queries is described for the general case. It should be emphasized that our treatment of local closed world information generalizes that of <ref> (Etzioni et al. 1994) </ref> by considering the semantics of expressive constraint formulas in the rules and completeness statements. In contrast, (Etzioni et al. 1994) reasons with conjunctions of constraints of the form X = c, where X is a variable and c is a constant. <p> It should be emphasized that our treatment of local closed world information generalizes that of <ref> (Etzioni et al. 1994) </ref> by considering the semantics of expressive constraint formulas in the rules and completeness statements.

Reference-contexts: This definition is motivated by the need to determine relevance without actually accessing the external information sources, which would undermine the optimization effort. The query processor in IM uses the query-tree algorithm presented in <ref> (Levy and Sagiv 1992) </ref> for determining the relevant portions of external information sources. Finding relevant portions of the external source relations proceeds in two steps.

Reference-contexts: For more details on definitions of relevance, see <ref> (Levy and Sagiv 1993a) </ref>. Based on these definitions, we can define portions of external information sources relevant to a query as follows.

Reference-contexts: Second, by using the close relationship between the problem of reasoning with LCW statements and the problem of determining independence of queries from updates <ref> (Levy and Sagiv 1993b) </ref>, we obtain a general algorithm for inferring LCW of queries and for pruning redundant information sources. We begin by describing the representation language used in IM, and how we describe properties of information sources. <p> Levy (Levy 1994) shows that the problem of inferring completeness for queries is closely related to the prob-lem of determining independence of queries from updates <ref> (Levy and Sagiv 1993b) </ref>. One consequence of this close connection is the following: Theorem 2: Suppose that for any rule in the knowledge base, the antecedent contains at most one occurrence of every domain relation.

Reference-contexts: For instance, in our example, we do not have complete information about numbers in the NYC area, even though we have complete information about the 718 area code. Levy <ref> (Levy 1994) </ref> shows that the problem of inferring completeness for queries is closely related to the prob-lem of determining independence of queries from updates (Levy and Sagiv 1993b). <p> This means that, although other source relations may be relevant, there is no subset of the chosen source relations that would produce the same answer to the query (i.e., every proper subset may result in missing some answers). In <ref> (Levy 1994) </ref>, a sound and complete inference procedure for determining completeness of queries is described for the general case. <p> Finally, the close connection with the problem of independence of queries from updates sheds light on the complexity of the problem of inferring completeness (see <ref> (Levy 1994) </ref> for details). Interacting with IM The IM system implements a WWW client with a multimedia hypertext interface (similar to Mosaic) coupled with a knowledge base for organizing and querying Internet information sources.
