Abstract: The goal of the inverse problem in electroencephalography is to determine electrical activity within the cranial volume, based on potential measurements taken from the scalp. In this paper, we discuss our implementation of a flexible, extensible system to solve the inverse EEG problem. Our implementation is constructed on top of the SCIRun problem solving environment, a flexible framework for implementing large-scale scientific and engineering applications. We leverage the power of this underlying software architecture in the design and implementation of our inverse EEG pipeline. We apply our inverse EEG software system to a test subject's P300 auditory response.

Reference-contexts: This inverse problem lies at the foundation of surgical planning and prognosis for neurological conditions ranging from epilepsy to schizophrenia <ref> [1] </ref> and to brain tumors. The goal of cortical mapping is to integrate patient anatomical information and measured voltage potential recordings from the surface of the patient's scalp in order to non-invasively determine the electrical activity on and within the patient's cortical surface [2].

Reference-contexts: The goal of cortical mapping is to integrate patient anatomical information and measured voltage potential recordings from the surface of the patient's scalp in order to non-invasively determine the electrical activity on and within the patient's cortical surface <ref> [2] </ref>. There has been much research into computationally modeling the electrical activity of the brain, but only a few successful systems have been implemented. These systems range in geometric model complexity from grossly simplified, spherical representations to patient-specific finite element models.

Reference-contexts: This blocky structure does not accurately represent the fine-grained structure of the real data (i.e., the patient's head), and induces singularities in the finite element method. We smooth out the surfaces by exchanging the rectangles for triangles and applying a variation of Taubin's surface fairing algorithm <ref> [14] </ref>. This algorithm, extended to handle the non-manifold topology of the SurfaceTree, iteratively applies local-neighborhood attraction and repulsion operations to smooth the surface without significantly reducing the bounded volume. 5 image on the right shows the edges of the post-decimated surface.

Reference-contexts: At this point, the surfaces are overly resolved in smooth regions (e.g., the full SurfaceTree may contain hundreds of thousands to millions of triangles). To reduce this complexity without sacrificing geometric accuracy, we apply a Hoppe/DeRose style algorithm <ref> [15] </ref> that removes triangles in relatively flat regions. We augment the original technique to once again handle the non-manifold topology of our SurfaceTree.

Reference-contexts: In the middle, the analytic approximation has coregistered the points. On the right, the iterative refinement algorithm has reduced the squared distance between the points on the two surfaces. the three pairs of points. The mathematical derivation and proof of this method can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. Iterative Refinement: The second step of the algorithm performs the final fine-tuned alignment. This step is a variant of a hill-climbing algorithm: it iteratively moves the point cloud closer to the surface by attempting small translations along, and rotations about, the principal axes of the MR data.

Reference-contexts: Subjects silently counted the infrequent high-pitched target tones. Three blocks of 200 tones, yielding between 85-95 target epochs, were presented. Sixty-four channels of EEG were collected with a Geodesic Sensor Net (Electrical Geodesics Inc., Eugene, OR) employing Ag/AgCl electrodes and a KCl electrolyte <ref> [26] </ref>. The ERP was computed from the raw EEG by averaging the individual trials time-locked to stimulus onset. A 0.01 to 16 Hz digital filter was applied after the individual ERPs were averaged to eliminate residual 60-67 Hz electrical noise.
