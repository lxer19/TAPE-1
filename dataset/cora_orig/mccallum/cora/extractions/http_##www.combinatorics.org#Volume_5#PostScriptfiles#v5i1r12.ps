Abstract: We show that the moments of the trace of a random unitary matrix have combinatorial interpretations in terms of longest increasing subsequences of permutations. To be precise, we show that the 2n-th moment of the trace of a random k-dimensional unitary matrix is equal to the number of permutations of length n with no increasing subsequence of length greater than k. We then generalize this to other expectations over the unitary group, as well as expectations over the orthogonal and symplectic groups. In each case, the expectations count objects with restricted "increasing subsequence" length.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Much work has been done in the combinatorial literature on the "increasing subsequence problem", that of studying the distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation. The problem was first considered by Hammersley ([5]); good summaries can be found in <ref> [1] </ref> and [10], which gives an alternate proof of Theorem 1.1. This problem is also closely connected to the representation theory of S n , particularly the theory of Young tableaux.

Reference-contexts: Thus, under the Schensted correspondence in S N , B n corresponds to the set of pairs of self-dual tableaux. The following result is known (proposition 17 in <ref> [2] </ref>; see also [7]): Lemma 2.5. There is a bijection between the set of self-dual tableaux of shape and the set of domino (almost-domino) tableaux of shape . Theorem 2.3 follows immediately. fl Remark.

Reference-contexts: Finally, section 4 proves an alternate form of theorem 1.1, originally given in [10]. This work is taken from section 5 of the author's Ph.D. thesis ([11]). 1. The classical increasing subsequence problem In <ref> [4] </ref>, Diaconis and Shashahani give the following result: E U2U (k) jTr (U ) n j for n k, where the expectation is taken with respect to Haar measure. <p> As in <ref> [4] </ref>, we can think of this as an inner product of Tr (U ) n with itself; since the nonzero Schur functions are orthonormal with respect to this inner product, we can simplify things by expanding Tr (U ) n = p 1 n (U ) (a power-sum symmetric function) into <p> Define f nk = E U2U (k) jTr (U m ) n j Then f (m) nk is the number of 2 S (m) n such that has no increasing subsequence of length greater than k. Remark. <ref> [4] </ref> gives the following formula: E U2U (k) jTr (U m ) n j for k mn. This also follows from theorem 2.2; if k mn, then no element of S n has an increasing subsequence of length greater than k. <p> This pairing, unfortunately, does not respect shape. Thus, only in those cases in which the signs in the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula are constant for each shape can we expect a nice result as above. (At least for k small; in the case jj; jj k, <ref> [4] </ref> gives a closed form for E U2U (k) (p (U )p (U )).) The signs in the case = = m n are constant, as we mentioned above; the only remaining case (as far as the author knows) with constant signs is = = 2 n 1, so it is <p> It is unclear whether there is a simpler proof that these two combinatorial quantities are the same; unfortunately, the natural bijection between S (2) n and B n does not preserve increasing subsequence length. Remark. Again, <ref> [4] </ref> gives theorem 2.3, in the special case k N . 3. The other classical groups The above results can be extended, in the simpler cases, to the orthogonal and symplectic groups, using some facts on the expectations of Schur functions over these groups. <p> However, there is apparently no immediate extension to E O (k) (T r (O m ) n ) and E Sp (2k) (T r (S m ) n ). Remark. Again, <ref> [4] </ref> give a formula for E O2O (k) (p (O)) and E S2Sp (2k) (p (S)), for k sufficiently large compared to jj, using properties of the Brauer algebra; proofs of their results along the above lines are given as theorems 6.2 and 6.4 of [11]. 4.

Reference-contexts: Johansson has recently used this formula to give another proof that the mean of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation of length N is asymptotically 2 p N <ref> [6] </ref>. He also has similar results for the quantities of theorem 2.2 (personal communication), as well as heuristics for the variance. It is also worth remarking that Regev ([12,3]) has considered the asymptotics of f nk for k fixed, as well as the (combinatorial) quantities of theorem 3.4.

Reference-contexts: Proof. A "domino tableau" is defined (see, for instance, <ref> [7] </ref>) as a rim-hook tableau with content 2 n ; every value appears in two neighboring positions. Similarly we define an "almost-domino tableau" as a rim-hook tableau with content 2 n 1. <p> Thus, under the Schensted correspondence in S N , B n corresponds to the set of pairs of self-dual tableaux. The following result is known (proposition 17 in [2]; see also <ref> [7] </ref>): Lemma 2.5. There is a bijection between the set of self-dual tableaux of shape and the set of domino (almost-domino) tableaux of shape . Theorem 2.3 follows immediately. fl Remark.

The representation theory aspects are covered in [13]; section 5.1.4 in <ref> [8] </ref> gives a good treatment of the more elementary Young tableaux results. The results reported here arose from the observation that a certain partial sum of characters of the symmetric group that occurs naturally in the increasing subsequence problem also appears when calculating certain expectations over the unitary group.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, it should be possible to derive Regev's asymptotic formula for f nk from theorem 1.1, together with standard results from random matrix theory relating the behavior of the eigenvalues of random unitary matrices to the behavior of the eigenvalues of Gaussian Hermitian matrices <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since B n S N is characterized as the subgroup of such that N + 1 (N + 1 x) = (x), we need to understand how this transformation acts on tableaux. This action can be stated in terms of a certain dualization operation on tableaux (due to Schutzenberger <ref> [14] </ref>).
