Abstract: This paper describes an approach taken to building customised non-linear regression software for modeling wind tunnel test data. This software was developed for the DARWIN group at NASA Ames. Wind tunnel testing is an expensive time-consuming part of the aircraft design and test cycle. Collecting good test data during wind tunnel testing is still considered a `black art' requiring the expert judgment of experienced test engineers. Test engineers previously could only view the outputs of the current test run, without convenient reference to the results of previous test runs. Real-time modeling of high-dimensional wind tunnel data inputs and outputs provides test engineers with feedback on the the quality of the test data collected. The task was to predict important output characteristics of wing designs being tested in the wind tunnel, such as coefficient of lifts and stallpoints. After considering various non-linear regression techniques, we chose Bayesian Gaussian Processes. Gaussian Processes are a flexible prediction model similar in behaviour (but not training method) to neural networks, while allowing us to attach error bars to the predictions. Rules to filter outliers from the data were also developed, so that test data is automatically prepared for input into the prediction model.

Reference-contexts: The goals of the Darwin system are to provide timely and convenient access to the all of the data collected during wind tunnel testing. The aim of our project was to provide customised prediction software using the KDD framework <ref> [2] </ref>. We augment the visualization of the current test run results with predictions based on earlier test runs.

Reference-contexts: However, GPs are computationally intensive because the space requirements grow quadrat-ically with the size of the dataset and the time requirements for the training algorithm grows cubically (because an inverse of a matrix whose size is proportional to the amount of training data is required). Gibbs and MacKay <ref> [4] </ref> discuss efficient approximations for calculating the inverse of the matrix in an effort to avoid this bottleneck. For our current application, we had access to a 1 gigabyte RAM machine with 16 processors and were able to train the datasets overnight.
