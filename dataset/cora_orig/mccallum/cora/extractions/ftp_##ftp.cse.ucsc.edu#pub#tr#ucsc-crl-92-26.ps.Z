Abstract: Many applications designed for wide-area systems use replication to provide a service at multiple locations. From which site should a client choose to obtain service? A client can specify its needs in terms of communication latency, bandwidth, or error rate. This specification must be matched against the expected performance available from each site. I present the results of two experiments that measured end-to-end performance, and discuss how the results can be used for prediction.

Reference-contexts: If the operation requires that only a small amount of information be moved between the sites, message latency will dominate performance. On the other hand, if large amounts of information must be transferred then bandwidth will dominate. For example, the archie system <ref> [Emtage92] </ref> provides an index of files that are available for anonymous FTP on the Internet. A user typically first sends one or more query message to archie to find a set of sites providing the file, then uses FTP to transfer it.

I was investigating quorum multicast protocols, that send a message to a fixed-size subset of a set of sites.

The subset is selected according to an ordering on the sites; for example, sites could be ordered by increasing expected response latency.
