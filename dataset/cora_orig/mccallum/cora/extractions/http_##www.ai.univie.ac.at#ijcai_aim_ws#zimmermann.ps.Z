Title: Exploiting Models of Musical Structure for Automatic Intention-Based Composition of Background Music

Abstract: Music is known to be able to support certain aims of presentations. In addition, there are a number of approaches to automatic music composition. Thus, it is a natural consequence, to establish automatic, intention-based music composition as an additional tool for multimedia presentation systems. However, many related applications show unsatisfactory results. An explanation for this phenomenon is that the consideration of musical structure at different abstraction levels is often neglected although many relevant theories do exist and have been refined to a high level. The aim of the project described in this paper is to build a system for the automatic composition of music that supports the intentions of a given presentation. The idea underlying the system design is that the composition process works on different abstraction levels, so that each subset of desired intentions can be realized at the appropriate level. The resulting coordination problems make great demands on the level of musical structure which functions as a link between the presentation intentions and the musical realization. It can be seen as a kind of "rhetorical" level of music. This paper discusses the relevant aspects concerning this structural level and introduces a composition system which exploits related theories.

[ Andre, 1995 ] defines two classes of action: main and subsidiary acts 4 . A main act builds the kernel of a message and the subsidiary acts are used to support or realize the main act. <p> It is planned to develop the analogies from the ideas of <ref> [ Andre, 1995 ] </ref> , which will mainly denote that the music-rhetorical and intentional hierarchies are not represented as trees, but rather as directed acyclic graphs, in order to satisfy the fact that, for instance, one musical segment can realize two or more intentions.

Reference-contexts: A further extension of the recent approaches is therefore, that the grammar uses constraints for sequentially combining harmonic motives. These constraints are derived from music analysis and taken from literature (e.g., <ref> [ Bruhn, 1988; Kramer, 1991 ] </ref> ). So far we can clearly see the division of the composition model into the realization of intention and the realization of music-rhetoric. The consideration of the attentional level remains to be explained.

Reference-contexts: Most of the related literature concerns two (extreme) levels of musical structure: On the upper level the structure of the musical form (e.g., sonata, song etc.) and on the lower level the structure of the notes, chords, rhythms etc.. However, at the intermediate level certain gaps remain (see also <ref> [ West et al., 1991 ] </ref> ). This intermediate level of musical structure plays an important role for the design of the desired system as it realizes the required connection between intention and music realization. Therefore, this level forms the focus of this paper.
