Abstract: The paper introduces ad-hoc workflow, adding flexibility to traditional workflow. A problem that stems from the added flexibility is the need to support end-users in the selection and modification of the process for a specific case. We propose a class of Petri nets to describe workflow processes, featuring safeness and guaranteed termination. A set of transformation rules with sufficient power for this class is given that can be implemented in a graphical editor. A second problem is monitoring the work being done. The solution here is to approximate the states of the cases being treated by the states of a few standard cases.

Reference-contexts: A graphical and easy-to-understand definition formalism for processes (like Petri nets) is important here. As described in Aalst <ref> [1] </ref>, workflow processes can be represented by a class of Petri nets called WF nets. When modeling a process by a WF net, its transitions represent the tasks to be performed, whereas its places represent conditions that enable them. The reachable markings represent the possible states of the process.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Workflow management systems support the daily operation of business processes by taking care of the logistic control of work (cf. WFMC [7], Koulopoulos [4], Ellis/Nutt <ref> [2] </ref>). Current workflow products support production workflow, where cases are handled according to a fixed definition of the tasks to be performed and their order. Production work-flow is characterized by a high frequency and a high level of standardization.

Reference-contexts: The safe WF (SWF) nets have the additional requirement that every marking reachable from I contains at most one token per place. Algorithms that check the WF or SWF properties of nets do exist; in fact a tool (WOFLAN <ref> [3] </ref>) has been built around them. Note that the example nets in Figures 1 and 2 are SWF nets. We suggest the following strategy for defining SWF nets serving as process templates and adaptations. Point of departure is a library of basic SWF net templates.

Reference-contexts: The organization and distribution of work in processes belongs to the realm of concurrency theory. We use Petri nets in this paper to describe concurrent processes. Petri Nets (cf. Reisig <ref> [5] </ref>) offer a model for concurrency that is simple and easily explained to non-specialists. We very briefly describe the Petri net concepts that are of importance to this paper. A net consists of nodes that are connected through directed arcs.

Reference-contexts: The closer the modified net stays to the template the more accurate the correspondence becomes. Given a template N , a modification M and a correspondence function F , we can approximate a state of M in N by means of F . By superposing (c.f. Voorhoeve/Aalst <ref> [6] </ref>) the approximations of the states of the cases derived from N , a manager gets an impression of the work in progress. Of course, other reports are rewuired as well. The important feature is that the manager only needs to know the template processes.
