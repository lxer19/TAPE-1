Weymouth. </author> <title> Using dynamic programming for minimizing the energy of active countours in the presence of hard constraints. </title> <booktitle> In Proc. of the Second International Conference on Compter Vision, </booktitle> <pages> pages 9599, </pages> <month> December </month> <year> 1988. </year>
Reference-contexts: This technique allows the modeling of non-rigid flexible objects, requiring different techniques than those used in traditional vision systems. 7 In some senses, the original work in this category is the concept of active con-tour models (or snakes), an energy minimization approach presented in [18] and further developed in <ref> [1, 7, 8, 50] </ref>. These approaches are used to identify and track two-dimensional and three-dimensional object boundaries based on images and voxel data. The various deformable model techniques tend to share a few characteristics.

Reference-contexts: Optical flow was used in <ref> [2] </ref> and [24] to measure plant growth. Automated systems to analyze seed vigor based on root growth [15, 43] have also been explored. Plant biologists are trying to use computers to aid their research [16].

Reference-contexts: Especially when the search is un-informed, any situation in which the error measure does not correctly penalize intuitively inaccurate models can severely degrade the search process. I will try alternate heuristics, such as chamfer matching, a contour based similarity measure used in [12] (originally described in <ref> [3] </ref>). Finally, perhaps the most challenging improvement to the reconstruction process is to design an algorithm in which robust top-down search can be guided (but not rely on or be overpowered by) lower level information.

Reference-contexts: These studies have been done at several anatomic levels. Automated analysis of the human face has many applications in computer graphics. In <ref> [4] </ref>, video tracking of hands and lips are use as an HCI. The entire face is tracked in [10, 9] using optical flow and a deformable model of the face.

Reference-contexts: Pre-processing Before any higher level processing is done, I need to obtain silhouette information from the gray-scale images provided as input. I first register the images so that the base of the stem occurs at the same location in three-space. Then, I use a Canny edge detector <ref> [5] </ref> to find the edges in the images. Finally, each image contour is filled using a seed fill algorithm, resulting in a binary image (black background, white silhouette).

This paper deals mostly with rigid objects and the recognition task, but highlights many important issues regarding the semantics of object representation.

Reference-contexts: introduction of a knowledge-based system. 4.1.2 Contour Analysis Aside from a rough boundary volume, what other types of information can silhouette analysis provide?

Reference-contexts: I think that an analysis that separates motion, growth, and morphological change components might be very useful. I plan to explore the use of quaternions <ref> [36, 41] </ref> for their ability to provide smooth interpolation of orientation information. I will also investigate a database implementation that allows storage and retrieval of object time-lines represented using the concise template parameters.

Reference-contexts: The various deformable model techniques tend to share a few characteristics. First, each uses some sort of mathematical description of flexible objects, parameterized to adjust to different inputs. For instance: in [20], the authors use hyperquadrics to estimate non-rigid motion from mammogram images; deformable superquadrics, described in <ref> [44] </ref> as having global shape parameters and local deformation, were used in [29] for object reconstruction; in [37], the parameters of the model are themselves functions. Secondly, deforming forces are defined which guide the model to a correct shape.

Reference-contexts: In many cases these are physically-based (as described in [11], for instance). These forces are either internal (e.g., due to tension or other material properties) or external (e.g., a tendency to move towards discontinuities in the input). A good example of these concepts can be found in <ref> [45] </ref>, which uses intrinsic constraints (surface coherence, symmetric regularity) and extrinsic constraints (image forces, human operator). Finally, the computational approach determines how the forces will be applied to the model. <p> The extruded general cylinder is used as a deformable model in [32]. Several issues involved in the tracking and modeling of tubular objects are addressed by [38]. Coupling low-level and high-level operations are mentioned in various work <ref> [25, 45] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, the problem is cast as one of energy minimization, with various forces and properties being specified as coupled differential equations. External forces are usually applied on a point-to-point basis (e.g., edges of model attracted to image edge feature), although <ref> [46] </ref> suggests an approach based on demons which focuses more on interactions between areas/volumes. In either case, implementations involve an iterative approach designed to converge towards a solution.

Reference-contexts: This technique allows the modeling of non-rigid flexible objects, requiring different techniques than those used in traditional vision systems. 7 In some senses, the original work in this category is the concept of active con-tour models (or snakes), an energy minimization approach presented in [18] and further developed in <ref> [1, 7, 8, 50] </ref>. These approaches are used to identify and track two-dimensional and three-dimensional object boundaries based on images and voxel data. The various deformable model techniques tend to share a few characteristics.
