Title: Parallel Computing on MultiSpert

Abstract: This report provides an overview of the MultiSpert parallel computer system and its performance characteristics. In order to preserve the existing programming and runtime environments, we have straight forwardly extended the single board system in a master/slave architecture with the SUN host as master controlling up to 16 Spert-II slaves. We describe the underlying hardware and its limitations, as well as the additional communication layers, which provide an efficient remote procedure calling mechanism. Timing measurements on a 5-node prototype confirm MultiSpert scalability to high performance levels.

Reference-contexts: the Spert device driver (see section 3.1). 1 Due to hardware errors in the expander boxes, we had to revert to only using two boards per slot. 1 2.2 Communication The Spert-II board memory can be read and written from the SUN host via the T0 processor's TSIP byte-serial interface <ref> [AB97] </ref>. This interface reads 20 Bytes of address and data from the TSIP port at the rate of 1 Byte per cycle, before using one cycle of the T0 memory bus to transfer 16 bytes of data to the desired 32-bit address.
