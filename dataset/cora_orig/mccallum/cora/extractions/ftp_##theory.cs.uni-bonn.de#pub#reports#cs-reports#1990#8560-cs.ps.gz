Abstract: We present two algorithms on sparse rational interpolation. The first is the interpolation algorithm in a sense of sparse partial fraction representation of rational functions. The second is the algorithm for computing entier and the remainder of a rational function. The first algorithm works without apriori known bound on the degree of a rational function, the second one is in the class NC provided that the degree is known. The presented algorithms complement the sparse interpolation result of [GKS 90b]. fl On leave from Steklov Institute of Mathematics, Soviet Academy of Sciences, Leningrad 191011 y Supported in part by the Leibniz Center for Research in Computer Science, by the DFG Grant KA 673/4-1 and by the SERC Grant GR-E 68297

Reference-contexts: If f 1 =f 2 is given by a short straight-line program, then (f 1 =f 2 ) 0 can be represented also by a short straight-line program e.g. by virtue of <ref> [BS 83] </ref>. If (f 1 =f 2 ) is given by a certain physical process, then also one can get (f 1 =f 2 ) 0 . With the help of (f 1 =f 2 ) 0 one can recover the highest term of f 1 =f 2 at 1.

Reference-contexts: Lemma is proved. Then one can produce in NC (<ref> [BC 86] </ref>) an integer t 4dt 2 and multiply it on N , so we get a rational number greater than 2 M=2t . Then again involving [BC 86], one can construct a rational number N 0 &gt; 36 2 3M d 5 . Calculate q (N 0 ). W.l.o.g. assume that lc (f ) &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: Take an integer N = [N 1 ] + 1, which is also a big enough number. Having a big enough integer N , we'll find the entier [f =g] = h by a method similar to <ref> [BT 89] </ref> (see also [GK 87]), which one can call an approximative polynomial interpolation. We compute q (N ); q (N 2 ); : : : ; q (N 2t ) and take the nearest integers to them, respectively, 9 A 1 ; : : : ; A 2t . <p> Then A i = h (N i ), 1 i 2t, since N is big enough, and one can apply BCH--codes (as in <ref> [BT 89] </ref>) to recover the powers of X occurring in h, and also the coefficients. Arithmetic complexity of the whole procedure for finding entier h is (t log d) O (1) and parallel complexity O (log t log log d). Acknowlegment: We thank Mike Singer for the number of interesting discussions.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the previous sections we suppose that we know a bound d on the degrees deg (f); deg (g) &lt; d. Under this supposition we'll show that the problem of finding the entier [f =g] = h 2 ZZ [X] is in the parallel class NC (cf. <ref> [C 85, KR 90] </ref>). Denote d 1 = deg (f ), d 0 = deg (g), M is a maximal of bit-sizes of the coefficients of f; g (they are not supposed to be given). Represent q = f =g = 8 [f=g] + g .
