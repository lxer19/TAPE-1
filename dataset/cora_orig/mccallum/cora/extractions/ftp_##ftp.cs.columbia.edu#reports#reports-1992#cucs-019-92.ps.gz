Abstract: Graphs of small average genus are characterized. In particular, a Kuratowski-type theorem is obtained: except for finitely many graphs, a cutedge-free graph has average genus less than or equal to 1 if and only if it is a necklace. We provide a complete list of those exceptions. A Kuratowski-type theorem for graphs of maximum genus 1 is also given. Some of the methods used in obtaining these results involve variations of a classical result of Whitney.

Reference-contexts: Subsequently, any characterization of imbeddability by a list of obstructions has been called a "Kuratowski-type" result, as has any proof that there are only finitely many essential obstructions. Glover, Huneke, and Wang [GlHuWa 1979] constructed a list of 103 independent obstructions to imbeddability in the projective plane, and Archdeacon <ref> [Archdeacon 1981] </ref> proved that the list is complete. The combination of these two results shows that the minimum crosscap number of a graph is at most 1 if and only if G contains no subgraphs that are homeomorphic to any graph in the list of the 103 graphs.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2.1 ([Whitney 1932]) 3 A graph G without self-loops has an open linear synthesis from a simple cycle if and only if G is 2-connected. We shall use the following two variations of Whitney's theorem (see <ref> [Chen 1990] </ref>): Theorem 2.2 A graph G without self-loops is 2-connected if and only if G has an open linear synthesis from every 2-connected subgraph. Theorem 2.3 A graph G has a linear synthesis from a simple cycle if and only if G is cutedge-free.

Reference-contexts: This value is evidently a rational number, and it is clearly an invariant of the homeomorphism type of a graph. The average genus of individual graphs is in the Gross-Furst hierarchy <ref> [GrFu 1987] </ref> and was studied by Gross, Klein, and Rieper [GrKlRi 1989] (Stahl [Stahl 1983] studied the related problem of the average genus of a class of graphs with the same number of edges). [GrKlRi 1989] proved that the smallest positive values of average genus are 1=3; 1=2; 5=9; 2=3; 19=27; <p> Theorem 4.4 The average genus of a bar-amalgamation of a graph G and a cactus equals the average genus of G. Proof. A direct consequence of Corollary 4.3 and Theorem 5 of Gross and Furst <ref> [GrFu 1987] </ref>. Therefore, when we discuss the average genus of graphs, we can avoid cacti. We introduce the concept of a cactus-free graph, which is inductively defined as follows: 1. Every cutedge-free graph that is not a simple cycle is cactus-free. 2. <p> If a cactus-free graph G is not cutedge-free, then it is a bar-amalgamation of two cactus-free graphs G 1 and G 2 . The average genus of a bar-amalgamation equals the sum of average genera of the components <ref> [GrFu 1987] </ref>. If both G 1 and G 2 are homeomorphic to B 2 , then G has average genus 2=3. Otherwise, G will have average genus at least 1=3 + 1=2 = 5=6. <p> Since a cutedge-free graph that is not a simple cycle has the maximum genus at least 1 and the maximum genus of a bar-amalgamation of two graphs is equal to the sum of the maximum genera of the two graphs <ref> [GrFu 1987] </ref>, we conclude that the maximum genus of the graph G is at least 2. Combining all these, we realize that if the maximum genus of a cactus-free graph G is 1, then G must be 2-connected and has average genus less 24 than 1.

However, there are, in general, more than one non-homeomorphic necklace of type (r; s) for s &gt; 1. 3 2-connected graphs with small average genus Gross, Klein and Rieper <ref> [GrKlRi 1989] </ref> have studied 3-connected graphs with small average genus. They proved that K 4 is the only 3-connected graph of average genus less than 1. They also showed, however, that there are infinitely many 2-connected graphs of average genus less than 1. <p> They proved that K 4 is the only 3-connected graph of average genus less than 1. They also showed, however, that there are infinitely many 2-connected graphs of average genus less than 1. In this section, after an extension of the results of Gross, Klein and Rieper <ref> [GrKlRi 1989] </ref>, we characterize all 2-connected graphs of average genus less than 1. To study 2-connected graphs with small average genus, we apply Whit-ney's theorem, starting with a simple cycle. We consider all possible ways to subsequently add paths, and we examine the average genus of all resulting 4 graphs. <p> Proof. A graph G is 2-connected if and only if there is no cutpoint in G. However, it is straightforward to establish that deleting a self-loop in a graph does not create a cutpoint. A necklace is obviously 2-connected. The following lemma of Gross, Klein, and Rieper <ref> [GrKlRi 1989] </ref> gives the average genus of necklaces. Lemma 3.2 The average genus of a necklace N (r;s) of type (r; s) equals 1 2 sr Proof.

The closed orientable surface of genus n is denoted S n . <p> Thus C is a Hamiltonian cycle that contains one edge of each doubled edge-pair and none of the self-loops. In the plane, we draw a rotation projection (see <ref> [GrTu 1987] </ref>) for N (r;s) so that C lies on a circle.

Section 3 discusses 2-connected graphs with average genus less than or equal to 1. <p> A Kuratowski-type theorem was also derived for the maximum genus of graphs.

Reference-contexts: At the end of that paper, it was asked that what kind of graphs can have average genus less than 1. In the present paper, we investigate the properties of graphs with average genus less than or equal to 1. Using a classical result of Whitney <ref> [Whitney 1932] </ref>, we are able to prove that with only finitely many exceptions, a cutedge-free graph of average genus less than 1 must be a necklace. We also list all those exceptional graphs. This result gives us several interesting corollaries. <p> The average genus of G is defined to be the value fl avg (G) = i=0 i g i i=0 g i Now we introduce the concept of linear synthesis of graphs, which originates from a classical work by Whitney <ref> [Whitney 1932] </ref>, and we review Whitney's theorem that an undirected graph is 2-connected if and only if it has an open linear synthesis. Definition Let G = (V; E) be a graph. <p> Without loss of generality, we suppose that G is obtained by adding an edge e to G 1 . Each rotation system R 1 of G 1 can be extended to c rotation systems of G, where c is a 3 In his seminal work <ref> [Whitney 1932] </ref>, Whitney neither mentioned this result nor introduced the terminology "linear synthesis" explicitly. What he proved is that any 2-connected graph of cycle rank greater than 1 contains a path whose removal results in a 2-connected graph. <p> Whitney's classical result <ref> [Whitney 1932] </ref> on edge deletion was used in the proof of the above result. Many interesting open problems are available for further research. We have proved that with only eight exceptions, a 2-connected graph of average genus less than 1 must be a necklace.

Reference-contexts: It is also easy to see that a spanning tree of N (r;s) must be a Hamiltonian path in N (r;s) . Therefore, the cotree has r +s1 odd components. Now it is easily derived from Xuong's theorem <ref> [Xuong 1979] </ref> that the maximum genus of N (r;s) is 1. <p> Therefore their average genus 1 implies that their maximum genus must be larger than 1. Now we consider cutedge-free graphs. Look at Figure 13 for all cutedge-free graphs of average genus less or equal to 1 that are not 2-connected. Using Xuong's theorem <ref> [Xuong 1979] </ref>, we easily check that all these graphs have the maximum genus greater than 1. Finally, let us consider cactus-free graphs that are not cutedge-free. A cactus-free graph is not a cactus so its maximum genus is at least 1 (see Corollary 4.3). <p> Combining all these, we realize that if the maximum genus of a cactus-free graph G is 1, then G must be 2-connected and has average genus less 24 than 1. Look at each of the graphs in Figure 12, use Xuong's theorem <ref> [Xuong 1979] </ref>, we easily check that only the five graphs in Figure 14 are of the maximum genus 1. These graphs are exactly the set 2C 2 of graphs that have length-2 linear synthesis from a cycle. We now conclude this section with the following theorem.
