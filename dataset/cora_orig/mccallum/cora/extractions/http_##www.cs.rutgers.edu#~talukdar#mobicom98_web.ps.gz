Abstract: This paper considers the problem of handoff management in an Integrated Services Packet Network supporting mobile hosts. In such a network, links may become overloaded due to a high concentration of mobile hosts within a given cell. As a result, the required Quality of Service guarantees cannot be provided to all flows in that cell. However, there exists adaptive applications which can operate over a wide range of available bandwidth. Thus, it may be possible to overcome the link overload condition by reducing the bandwidth of individual flows, which we call rate adaptation. The two most important properties of a rate adaptation scheme are its network overhead and its fairness property. Rate adaptation schemes which ensure certain fairness properties, such as maxmin optimality criteria, have very high network overhead. Therefore, these schemes are not suitable for a highly mobile environment where rate adaptation may have to be invoked frequently. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between the network overhead and the fairness property of rate adaptation in a mobile environment. We first characterize the fairness property of rate adaptation by several measurable parameters. We then describe two rate adaptation schemes, one of which has very low network overhead but is `unfair', while the other scheme is `fair' but has very high network overhead. Finally we propose a new rate adaptation scheme which reconciles the two conflicting properties. Results of simulation experiments comparing the performances of the three rate adaptation schemes are presented. fl This research work was supported in part by DARPA under contract numbers DAAH04-95-1-0596 and DAAG55-97-1-0322, NSF grant numbers CCR 95-09620, IRIS 95-09816 and Sponsors of WIN-LAB.

Reference-contexts: There are many schemes in the literature that have focussed on the problem of maintaining connectivity at the network and transport layer in spite of the mobility of the mobile hosts <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Also, there have been several proposals for supporting real-time applications in an Integrated Services Packet Network (ISPN). Typical applications that require real-time services include audio library, image browsing, video conferencing and video-on-demand. <p> We assumed poisson arrival of flows i.e. interarrival times between successive flows is exponentially distributed. Flow duration and cell stay time are also exponentially distributed. The size of mobility spec has a uniform distribution within the range <ref> [2, 10] </ref>. In the following we describe the notations used for flow and mobility parameters: * a : Mean flow arrival rate in number of flows per second * d f : Mean duration of flows. * m : Mean mobility rate in number of moves per sec ond.

Reference-contexts: However many applications are adaptive in nature and they can operate over a wide range of bandwidth. For example, in the wireless communication environment, recently developed hardware for video coding can adaptively deliver digital video at rates between 60K bits/sec and 600K bits/sec <ref> [4] </ref>. Also, to support heterogeneous receivers, use of layered media streams has been suggested for real-time multimedia transmissions [9, 12, 15, 19].

Reference-contexts: These works have focused on the efficiency and fairness of the rate allocation scheme.

Reference-contexts: In this model, the multimedia data source disseminates multiple levels of quality across multiple network channels and a receiver can adapt its reception rate by adjusting the number of layers it receives. There has been several proposals for layered video compressions and layered transmission systems <ref> [16, 6] </ref>. Therefore, in such a network, it may be possible to overcome the link overload condition by reducing the bandwidth of individual flows, which we call rate adaptation.

We also assume that, the base stations have sufficient computing power and therefore it is more important to reduce network overhead (possibly) at the expense of computations at the base stations. <p> Note that, we do not invoke rate adaptation to admit a new flow in an overloaded cell.

Reference-contexts: Mobility of hosts has a significant impact on the QoS parameters of a real-time application. The existing system architecture <ref> [8] </ref> for real-time services in a network with fixed hosts is not adequate for supporting mobile hosts. To mitigate the impacts of mobility on the real-time services to mobile users, several new system architectures have been proposed by Talukdar et. al.[21, 22], Lu et. al.[14] and Lee [13]. <p> A flow can operate at several bandwidth level. Usually, the data traffic of a flow operating at a particular bandwidth level is described by a token bucket filter <ref> [8] </ref> consisting of the token generation rate, bucket depth and the peak rate.

Reference-contexts: In such a network, certain links may become overloaded when a large number of mobile hosts enter into a cell and the bandwidth of the link is not sufficient to provide the required throughput of all flows simultaneously. This problem may also arise in a link sharing environment <ref> [10] </ref>, where multiple agencies, protocol families, or traffic types share the bandwidth of a common link. In such a system, the available bandwidth to a particular service class may vary over time depending on the user load in other service classes. <p> We assumed poisson arrival of flows i.e. interarrival times between successive flows is exponentially distributed. Flow duration and cell stay time are also exponentially distributed. The size of mobility spec has a uniform distribution within the range <ref> [2, 10] </ref>.
