Title: ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF NONPARAMETRIC STRUCTURAL MODELS  
Author: Judea Pearl 
Address: Los Angeles, CA 90024  
Affiliation: Cognitive Systems Laboratory Computer Science Department University of California,  
Abstract: In this paper we study the identification of nonparametric models, that is, models in which both the functional forms of the equations and the probability distributions of the disturbances remain unspecified. Identifiability in such models does not mean uniqueness of structural parameters but rather uniqueness of policy-related predictions that such parameters would normally support. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for identifying predictions of the type "Find the distribution of Y , assuming that X is controlled by external intervention," where Y and X are arbitrary variables of interest. Whenever identifiable, such predictions can be expressed in closed algebraic form, in terms of observed distributions. We also show how the identifying criteria can be tested qualitatively using the graphical representation of the structural model, thus simplifying and generalizing the standard identifiability tests of linear models (e.g., rank and order). Finally, we provide meaningful and precise definitions of effect decomposition for both parametric and nonparametric models.

Reference-contexts: The standard definition of a total effect is expressed algebraically, in terms of a matrix B of "structural coefficients" [Bollen 1989], and these coefficients, circularly, are defined in terms of total effects when intervening variables are "held constant", <ref> [Alwin & Hauser 1975] </ref>. With the exception of [Sobel 1990], the notions of "intervening variables", "holding constant", and "structural coefficients" have not been given formal, operational definitions and have remained open to a variety of misinterpretations.

Reference-contexts: While the added arc Z ! X permits us to calculate bounds on P (yj^x) [Robins 1989, Section 1g],[Manski 1990, Balke & Pearl 1994], and the upper and lower bounds may even coincide for certain types of distributions P (x; y; z) <ref> [Balke & Pearl 1993, Pearl 1995b] </ref> there is no way of computing P (yj^x) for every positive distribution P (x; y; z), as required by Definition 2.

Reference-contexts: However, in order to read off the dependencies embodied in a given graph, it sometimes may be convenient to restore the U variables. In 6 The recursive nature of Eq. (21) corresponds to a lower triangular matrix B in linear models <ref> [Bollen 1989] </ref> and therefore excludes feedback mechanisms. This restriction is not essential to the discussion of the basic concepts, though it simplifies the test for identifiability. <p> However, adding an arc Z ! X to the structure (that is, finding a variable Z that is correlated with X but not with U ) would facilitate the computation of b via the instrumental-variable formula <ref> [Bowden & Turkington 1984, Bollen 1989] </ref>: b = @x E (Y jz) = R xz In nonparametric models, adding an instrumental variable Z to a bow-pattern (Figure 5 (b)) does not permit the identification of P (yj^x). <p> X intercepts all directed paths from Z to Y , and, 2. P (yj^x) is identifiable in G Z . 3.4 Total, Direct, and Indirect Effects Path analysis is noted for allowing researchers to decompose the influence of one variable on another into direct, indirect, and total effects <ref> [Bollen 1989, page 376] </ref>. Yet the path-analytic literature has not been successful in communicating these notions unambiguously to the rest of the scientific community. <p> Yet the path-analytic literature has not been successful in communicating these notions unambiguously to the rest of the scientific community.

In nonlinear analysis, differences lose their sig nificance, and one must isolate the contribution of mediating paths in some alternative 26 way.

Reference-contexts: This stands contrary to the warning, repeated in most of the literature on statistical experimentation, to refrain from adjusting for concomitant observations that are affected by the treatment <ref> [Cox 1958, Rosenbaum 1984, Pratt & Schlaifer 1988] </ref>. <p> In the context of linear regression models, the problem amounts to deciding whether it is appropriate to add a set Z of variables to the regression of Y on X. Most of the statistical literature is satisfied with informal warnings that "Z should be quite unaffected by X" <ref> [Cox 1958, page 48] </ref>, which is necessary but not sufficient (see Figure 8 (d)) or that X should not precede Z [Shafer 1996, page 326], which is neither necessary nor sufficient.

Reference-contexts: Freedman [1987] finds the notion of "fixing" an endogenous variable X to be "self-contradictory", as it conflicts with the assumption that the value of X is functionally determined by the explanatory variables in the equation for X. <ref> [Freedman 1987] </ref> summarizes the confusion in this area: a path model represents the analysis of observational data as if it were the result of an experiment.

Reference-contexts: This is indeed the intuition behind the formula in Eq. (32) and, given the causal assumptions of Figure 7, the tobacco industry's argument is the correct one (see <ref> [Pearl 1995a, Pearl 1994] </ref> for formal derivation).

Reference-contexts: In words, the expression P (yj^x; z) will stand for the probability of Y = y given that Z = z is observed and X is held constant at x. Armed with this notation, we formulate the three basic inference rules of our calculus in the following theorem <ref> [Pearl 1995a] </ref>: Theorem 3 Let G be a DAG characterizing a structural model M , and let P be a distribution generated by some theory of M . <p> actions P (yj^x; ^z; w) = P (yj^x; w) if (Y k ZjX; W ) G X; Z (W) where Z (W ) is the set of Z-nodes that are not ancestors of any W -node in G X . 2 Each of the inference rules above can be proven <ref> [Pearl 1995a] </ref> from the basic interpretation of the "set (x)" operation as a replacement of the causal mechanism that connects X to its parents prior to the operation with a new mechanism X = x introduced by the intervention (Definition 3). <p> It can be anticipated, therefore, that by separating issues of identification and parametric form this article should serve to make the language of path analysis more accessible to the scientific community (see discussions following <ref> [Pearl 1995a] </ref>). Acknowledgment This investigation benefitted from discussions with Joshua Angrist, Peter Bentler, David Cox, Sander Greenland, Arthur Goldberger, David Hendry, Paul Holland, Guido Imbens, Ed Leamer, Rod McDonald, John Pratt, James Robins, Paul Rosenbaum, Donald Rubin, and Michael Sobel. <p> This is indeed the intuition behind the formula in Eq. (32) and, given the causal assumptions of Figure 7, the tobacco industry's argument is the correct one (see <ref> [Pearl 1995a, Pearl 1994] </ref> for formal derivation).

Reference-contexts: Thus, we have P (yjz; ^x) = P (yj^z) (36) which was calculated in Eq. (33). Substituting Eqs. (33), (36), and (29) back into Eq. (34) yields P (yj^x) = z X P (yjx 0 ; z)P (x 0 ) (37) Eq. (37) was named the "front-door" formula in <ref> [Pearl 1995b] </ref>, as it involves a (nonstandard) adjustment for a variable (Z) that stands between the cause (X) and the effect (Y ). 16 Task-4, compute P (y; zj^x) P (y; zj^x) = P (yjz; ^x)P (zj^x) The two terms on the right-hand side were derived in Eqs. (29) and (36), <p> This is a familiar problem in the analysis of clinical trials in which treatment assignment (Z) is randomized (hence, no 17 link enters Z), but compliance is imperfect <ref> [Pearl 1995b] </ref>. The confounding arc between X and Y in Figure 5 (b) represents unmeasurable factors which influence both subjects' choice of treatment (X) and subjects' response to treatment (Y ). <p> While the added arc Z ! X permits us to calculate bounds on P (yj^x) [Robins 1989, Section 1g],[Manski 1990, Balke & Pearl 1994], and the upper and lower bounds may even coincide for certain types of distributions P (x; y; z) <ref> [Balke & Pearl 1993, Pearl 1995b] </ref> there is no way of computing P (yj^x) for every positive distribution P (x; y; z), as required by Definition 2.

Reference-contexts: Second, the d-separation criterion for DAGs must be extended to cover cyclic graphs as well. The validity of d-separation has been established for non-recursive linear models and extended, using an augmented graph to any arbitrary set of stable equations <ref> [Spirtes 1994] </ref>. However, the computation of control queries will be harder in cyclic networks, because complete reduction of control queries to hat-free expressions may require the solution of nonlinear equations.
