Abstract: Given an available number of arithmetic operations per data sample, the tandem connection of a transform source code and a ReedSolomon channel code is optimized to minimize mean-squared error when transmitting Gauss-Markov data across a binary symmetric channel. The goal is to learn how well-designed systems allocate complexity, i.e. arithmetic operations, between source and channel coding. The tandem system considered here is chosen to be as representative as possible. For the range of source and channel parameters tested, it is found that when at least moderate complexity is available, a well-designed system allocates 10 to 35% of its complexity to the source code.

Reference-contexts: To compute the D i 's we make the assumption that when the decoder does not FAIL, it always produces the correct decision. As can be seen from <ref> [1] </ref>, this is a good assumption when the error correcting capability t is at least 4.

Reference-contexts: By the usual argument of combined source-channel coding (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>, pp. 179-181), where D s,i = D s,i (R s,i ) is the quantizer distortion described earlier and D c,i is the channel distortion defined by D c,i = N s,i where P i (j) is the probability that the quantizer for V i produces the jth level y i,j
