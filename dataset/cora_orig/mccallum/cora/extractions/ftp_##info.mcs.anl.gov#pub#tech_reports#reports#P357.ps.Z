Abstract: Most asymptotic convergence analysis of interior-point algorithms for monotone linear complementarity problems assumes that the problem is nondegenerate, that is, the solution set contains a strictly complementary solution. We investigate the behavior of these algorithms when this assumption is removed.

Reference-contexts: Section 3 proposes a scheme for estimating the index sets B, N , and J and shows that a finite termination scheme based on these estimates eventually yields an exact solution of (1). The results of this section generalizes the results obtained in Ye <ref> [9] </ref> for linear programs to the context of degenerate monotone LCPs. Feasible algorithms in which the step vectors asymptotically converge to the primal-dual affine scaling direction are discussed in Section 4. <p> We prove that finite termination can be achieved from any sufficiently advanced iterate (that is, when k is sufficiently large). The projection scheme is similar to that of Ye <ref> [9] </ref> for linear programming. In the interests of generality, we make a number of assumptions on the iterates (x k ; y k ) themselves, rather than on the algorithm used to generate them.
