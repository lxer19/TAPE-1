Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the relationship between image partitionings and transforms, and we introduce a new approach to utilize multiple domain blocks (AC terms) in the fractal transform. We then analyze the performance of coding with multiple DC terms and domain blocks. A new algorithm based on balancing the budget of DC terms and AC terms is developed.

Reference-contexts: The mathematical background of IFS coding is the fixed point theorem of contractive mappings in a complete space. The principle of IFS coding was first presented by Barnsley <ref> [1] </ref> in 1987 and brought into practice by Jacquin [6] in 1989. Since Jacquin developed the first block-based fractal algorithm, much research has been devoted to improving IFS coding techniques. <p> In other words, f ? is the fixed point of the contractive mapping T: f ? = T (f ? ). Based on the Collage Theorem <ref> [1] </ref>, the image f ? is expected to be an approximation of f and thus serves as the decoded image. IFS coding has several advantages: good fidelity/compression performance, fast decoding, resolution enhancement, etc. However, known encoding algorithms are very slow.

Reference-contexts: In order to use more DC terms more efficiently, we are considering the use of high order wavelets to represent DC terms. The discussion in this paper can be expanded to IFS codings in frequency fields. Recently, fractal codings with wavelets (like <ref> [3] </ref>) show a great advantage over the traditional method. We believe using image-dependent storage allocations for DC terms and AC terms has the potential to lead to further performance improvements.

A typical affine transformation is constructed in the following way (see Chapter 8 in <ref> [4] </ref>): For a range block R k , by solving Eq. (1), we can obtain the best domain block D j (k) and the affine transformation T k (D j (k) ) satisfying T k (D j (k) ) = P (R k ) + s O ffi G (D j <p> If we use 7, 5, 3, and 5 bits for the four parameters <ref> [4] </ref>, respectively, the storage for an AC term is almost double the storage for a DC term. Since each range block hosts a transformation, the partitioning scheme has a great impact on the encoding.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, using smaller range blocks also increases the complexity of searching for the best domain blocks. To reduce the total number of range blocks and speed up the search procedure, some new transformation formulas have been introduced. Monro <ref> [8] </ref> introduced the so-called Bath Fractal Transform (BFT) to use more than one DC term. He selected S to be a space of some low degree polynomials. The original goal of BFT is to reduce (even eliminate [9]) searching time by employing sophisticated transformations in the unform partitioning scheme. <p> A 256 fi 256 fi 8 Lenna is used as our test image. An image block R is marked 'smooth', 'moderate' or 'rugged' if the rms value of O ffi G (R) is in <ref> [0; 8] </ref>,(8; 16] or (16; 1), respectively. Fig.1 shows the result of classification of 16 fi 16 sized image blocks in Lenna. In the figure, dark areas are 'smooth', gray areas are 'moderate' and bright areas 'rugged'. They represent 27.34%, 42.19% and 30.47% of the image, respectively.

Reference-contexts: In the algorithm sketched above, the sizes of range blocks are fixed (independent of images). We call this kind of scheme uniform partitioning. In the past few years, many image-dependent partitioning schemes have been developed to work with IFS codings <ref> [11] </ref>. Among them, adaptive Quadtree and HV-Tree partitioning schemes are the most popular. In this article, we will use adaptive Quadtree in our discussion and experiments.

Reference-contexts: Currently, reducing the encoding complexity and speeding up the encoding process is still the most important problem to be solved in IFS codings. However, we do not address encoding speed in this paper.
