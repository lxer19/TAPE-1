Abstract: This paper describes IP3S, an Integrated Process Planning/Production Scheduling (IP3S) Shell for Agile Manufacturing. The IP3S Shell is designed around a blackboard architecture that emphasizes (1) concurrent development and dynamic revision of integrated process planning/production scheduling solutions, (2) the use of a common representation for exchanging process planning and production scheduling information, (3) coordination with outside information sources such as customer and supplier sites, (4) mixed initiative decision support, enabling the user to interactively explore a number of tradeoffs, and (5) portability and ease of integration with legacy systems . The system is scheduled for initial evaluation in a large and highly dynamic machine shop at Raytheons Andover manufacturing facility.
