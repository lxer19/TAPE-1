Abstract: Report SYCON-88-15 ABSTRACT Previous results about input to state stabilizability are shown to hold even for systems which are not linear in controls, provided that a more general type of feedback be allowed. Applications to certain stabilization problems and coprime factorizations, as well as comparisons to other results on input to state stability, are also briefly discussed.

Reference-contexts: In the case of exponential stability, where a Lyapunov function of quadratic growth exists (see e.g. [6], <ref> [1] </ref>) it is much easier to prove. 3 Proof of Main Results We first prove a technical lemma needed later. 3 Lemma 3.1 Assume that ffi : IR 2 0 ! IR 0 is a continuous mapping such that ffi (s; 0) &lt; 0 for all s &gt; 0. <p> 4 of class K 1 ; and * A continuous function : IR 0 ! IR 0 , with (s) 6= 0 for every s 6= 0 and decreasing on [1; +1) ; such that 1. g (s) 6= 0 for all s, and g (s) 1 for s 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ; 2. For each pair (s; r) 2 IR 2 0 for which r &lt; (s), necessarily ffi (s; r) &lt; 0 ; and 3. <p> and bounded interval I IR 0 , there exists some r 0 &gt; 0 such that s 2 I ) ffi (s; r) &lt; 0 for all r 2 [0; r 0 ] : (7) This follows from the uniform continuity of ffi on (for instance) the interval I fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> Now consider the intervals <ref> [1; 2] </ref>; [2; 3]; : : : and pick for each of these an r i &gt; 0; i = 1; 2; : : : so that (7) holds; without loss of generality, take r 1 &lt; 1 and assume that the r i decrease with i. <p> Similarly, choose a sequence of decreasing positive numbers r 0 i , with r 0 1 &lt; r 1 , corresponding to the intervals <ref> [1=2; 1] </ref>; [1=3; 1=2]; [1=4; 1=3]; : : :. We also assume (changing the r i 's if necessary) that r 0 1 &gt; r 2 . <p> By construction, it holds that, for each (s; r) 2 IR 2 0 , We next define g; ff 4 ; . Let g be any smooth function, never zero, which is identically 1 on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and which satisfies the inequalities g (s) &lt; s g (s) 1 for all s : (10) Such a g can always be defined: simply pick a function on each interval [k; k + 1], k 2 which has all derivatives equal to zero at the endpoints and so <p> always be defined: simply pick a function on each interval [k; k + 1], k 2 which has all derivatives equal to zero at the endpoints and so that r k k+1 = g (k) g (s) g (k + 1) on each such interval, pick a similar function on <ref> [1; 2] </ref> with values 1 and g (1) = 1, and then patch these together with g 1 on [0; 1]. Clearly this g satisfies the conditions in the first conclusion of the lemma. <p> derivatives equal to zero at the endpoints and so that r k k+1 = g (k) g (s) g (k + 1) on each such interval, pick a similar function on [1; 2] with values 1 and g (1) = 1, and then patch these together with g 1 on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

If it were the case that ff 4 (jj) &lt; jx (t)j (17) then jx (t)j 1 would again imply the contradiction (x (t); ) =2 (since g 1 for s 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>). 6 So we need only prove that if x (t) =2 S then (17) must hold.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In a previous paper <ref> [3] </ref> we studied the problem of when a system on IR n , _x = f (x) + G (x)u (1) with f and the entries of the n fi m matrix G being smooth, can be made input to state stable (ISS) in a rather strong sense to be reviewed <p> This more general class of feedback laws is of some interest, -for instance, it is the class used in most modern "geometric" nonlinear control,- although it is not appropriate for solving the type of problem (Bezout-type coprime factorizations) that was of interest in <ref> [3] </ref>. One may weaken the concept of coprimeness, however, and then the generalized theorem becomes applicable in this area as well; this will be discussed later. 1 In this note we establish the generalized result, for (2) under feedback laws (4). <p> It should be remarked that global smoothness of control laws is in general a restrictive requirement; see [4] for a discussion of this point and references to the literature. 2 Definitions and Statement of Results We recall the basic terminology from <ref> [3] </ref>. The function fl : IR 0 ! IR 0 is of class K if it is continuous strictly increasing and satisfies fl (0) = 0; it is of class K 1 if in addition fl (s) ! 1 as s ! 1. <p> We say that the system is stabilizable if there is a differentiable K such that this new system (with G 0) is GAS. The first property implies the second. The next result shows they are equivalent. The terminology "weak" is used to avoid confusion with the notion in <ref> [3] </ref>, where G = identity is required. Theorem 1 For (2) under control laws of the type (4), stabilizability implies weak input to state stabilizability. <p> The same idea works in higher dimensions, using Lyapunov functions, but working out the details takes some effort. The proof is given in the next section; it is far less constructive than the result given in <ref> [3] </ref>. The one dimensional case also suggests that as long as the controls remain small, ISS may hold. <p> Now consider the intervals [1; 2]; <ref> [2; 3] </ref>; : : : and pick for each of these an r i &gt; 0; i = 1; 2; : : : so that (7) holds; without loss of generality, take r 1 &lt; 1 and assume that the r i decrease with i. <p> In case s 2, (11) together with (10) imply that v (s) while for s 2 the same conclusion follows from (9) and (12). Then ffi must be negative, again by (8). Assume that the system _x = f (x; u) is GAS. As in <ref> [3] </ref>, we know that there exists a Lyapunov function for the system _x = f (x; 0), that is, there is a smooth function V : IR n ! IR 0 and functions ff 1 ; ff 2 ; ff 3 of class K 1 such that, for each ~ 2 <p> By definition of ffi, where v = jG (x (t))u (t)j g (s)r : Since s &gt; ff 4 (r), ffi must be negative because of the third conclusion in lemma 3.1. The proof of theorem 1 is now completed precisely as that of the main result in <ref> [3] </ref>: the above lemma gives equation (36) in that paper, and the rest of the proof goes through word by word (with the same notation). We now prove theorem 2. Let ffi be as above, and assume that ff 4 and are as in lemma 3.1. <p> We now prove theorem 2. Let ffi be as above, and assume that ff 4 and are as in lemma 3.1. The functions fi and fl constructed in <ref> [3] </ref> from ff 1 to ff 4 , together with the function to be constructed below, satisfy the conclusion of the theorem. To see this, we first establish two facts. <p> We define (s) := min fff 1 2 (ff 1 (1))); (ff 1 The same proof (discussion after equation (36)) as in <ref> [3] </ref> works again, for controls satisfying kuk (j~ 0 j). <p> The desired consusion follows then from fact 3.3 7 4 Coprime Factorizations We refer the reader to <ref> [3] </ref> for the definitions of input/output stable (IOS) operators, and the basic properties of this concept. We now modify Definition 4.1 (more precisely, its equivalent formulation via Lemma 4.2) in the above reference, to weaken the concept of coprimeness. <p> We now modify Definition 4.1 (more precisely, its equivalent formulation via Lemma 4.2) in the above reference, to weaken the concept of coprimeness. See e.g. [2] for this more general definition, which is not of a "Bezout" type as the one given in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> We first use Theorem 1 to obtain G and k. Now, let P be the operator defined as follows: P v () Since it is memoryless, and G and k are continuous everywhere, it follows that P is IOS. The operators N and D are chosen precisely as in <ref> [3] </ref>, that is, N is the input to state mapping of the closed-loop system (6), and D is the resulting mapping u 7! k (x) + G (x)u, which is itself stable (for the same reason that P is) and invertible. 5 Further Remarks In [6] (see also e.g. [1]) it <p> To illustrate this point it is sufficient to consider the system _x = tanh x + u : This is GAS, and f (x; u) is globally Lipschitz, but with u 1 one has that all trajectories diverge to +1. It was remarked in <ref> [3] </ref> that a cascade composition of what are there called "input/output stable" maps is again of that kind. In terms of state-space notions only, this translates into 8 the fact that cascading a GAS system with an ISS one gives a GAS system. <p> This is a local version of the corresponding global result given in <ref> [3] </ref>, with basically the same proof. Corollary 5.1 With the notations in theorem 2, for each real number k &gt; 0 the following property holds.

Reference-contexts: Applying the feedback law u = h (x; z) results then in a composite GAS system. We thus recover the folk result (see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref> for an application and references) that if a system is smoothly stabilizable then adding an integrator does not change this property. 9 Finally, we give an application of theorem 2 to show that, for each compact subset of the state space, small enough controls tending to zero give rise to
