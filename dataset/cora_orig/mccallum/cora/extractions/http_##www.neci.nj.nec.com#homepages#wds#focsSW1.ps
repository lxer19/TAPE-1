Title: Geometric separator theorems  
Author: Warren D. Smith Nicholas C. Wormald

Abstract: We have a 4-step method for producing "separator theorems" about geometrical objects en masse. Examples: I: Given N disjoint iso-oriented squares in the plane, there exists a rectangle with 2N=3 squares inside, 2N=3 squares outside, and (4 + o(1)) N partly in & out. II: More generally, given N iso-oriented d-cubes in d-space, no more than of which cover a point, there exists a box with 2N=3 cubes inside, 2N=3 cubes outside, and O(d 1=d N 11=d ) partly in & out. Here "2=3" is best possible, and the dependence of the bound on , d, and N is best possible up to the absolute constant factor in the O. III: We have more general versions where the "d-cubes" and/or the separating "box" could instead be any of a wide variety of convex objects with bounded diameter/width ratios, and where the disjointness condition can be replaced with a variety of other conditions: (a) no more than objects cover a point, or (b) no subcollection's measure exceeds the union of its measures by more than a factor , or (c) no more than objects, among objects whose linear dimensions vary by a factor at most , cover a point. For tons of applications of these theorems, see the companion paper "Applications of geometric separator theorems." For example, we get the first subexponen-tial algorithms for optimal traveling salesman tour and rectilinear Steiner tree of N points in d-space, d fixed.

Reference-contexts: We also have linear time algorithmic versions of our theorems (some with weaker constants). In contrast, a separator theorem proved by Miller and Thurston <ref> [25] </ref> depends on special properties of the "inversive group" and thus works only for separating spheres with spheres. Their proof also cannot be made to work for -overloaded and (; )-thick spheres, and unlike us they have no optimality proof for their separator theorem. <p> Their proof also cannot be made to work for -overloaded and (; )-thick spheres, and unlike us they have no optimality proof for their separator theorem. The present paper makes it clear that the Miller-Thurston result is a special case of a much more general phenomenon. But the <ref> [25] </ref> result makes up for its specialness with better performance that is, better constants (with better dependence on the dimension d) as we show by determining those constants for the first time 3 . We also (x3.3) have miscellaneous other separator theorems not derived from our main 4-step procedure. <p> also works with any of a wide class of weight functions where instead of demanding that N=(d + 2) of the balls lie entirely inside and outside, we demand 1=(d + 2) of the weight lie inside or outside. | This strengthens the theorem which was the central achievement in <ref> [25] </ref>, but for an inexplicable reason the results there were stated in weak forms involving "big-O" notation with undetermined constants (which in fact could depend on d in a totally unspecified way) 17 . Most of the present theorem was shown independently by [29].
