Abstract: CMS Technical Summary Report #95-01 July 1994 ABSTRACT In this paper, we provide an integral error formula for a certain scale of mean value interpolations which includes the multivariate polynomial interpolation schemes of Kergin and Hakopian. This formula involves only derivatives of order one higher than the degree of the interpolating polynomial space, and from it we can obtain sharp L 1 -estimates. These L 1 -estimates are precisely those that numerical analysts want, to guarantee that a scheme based on such an interpolation has the maximum possible order.

Reference-contexts: Observe that H (0) fi = H fi , which in part justifies the term `generalised Hermite map'. The generalised Hermite maps H (m) fi occurred in the approximation theory literature before they were lifted by Goodman in [13]; see e.g., de Boor <ref> [1] </ref> where they were used to bound spline interpolation.

Reference-contexts: Here only Kergin interpolation has been studied. Certain conditions on the position of the interpolation points and the growth of the entire function to be interpolated are given, which guarantee that the sequence of interpolants converges uniformly on compact sets. See, e.g., Bloom <ref> [2] </ref>. We are interested in the second approach, which is to write the error in interpolation as integration against derivatives of high order, much as is done for univariate Hermite interpolation.

Reference-contexts: Liftable maps In this section, we discuss univariate maps which may be lifted to multivariate ones. These `liftable' maps are crucial to both the construction and description of the error in a family of linear projectors which includes the Kergin and Hakopian maps. The main papers on `lifting' are <ref> [5] </ref>, [6], [7] and [17]. <p> If g 2 C 1 (IR), then we can differentiate g ffi fl , thereby obtaining (3:1) D y (g ffi fl ) = ( fl y) (Dg) ffi fl : This `lifts' differentiation to IR n . In <ref> [5] </ref> only the lifting of polynomial-valued maps is discussed. To `lift' the error in such maps, we need a more general definition. <p> For all f 2 C s (IR n ), the map is continuous. Proof. By Property 2.3 (e), the map (x; fi) 7! L fi f (x) is continuous. The literature contains no discussion of the `continuous' dependence of L fi on fi. In <ref> [5] </ref> it is shown that a complex regular Birkhoff interpolation procedure is liftable by writing it as a sum of elementary liftable maps. Thus, we have the following. Corollary 3.12. Let B be the a complex regular Birkhoff interpolation procedure and B its lift to IR n . <p> Another immediate consequence is the continuous dependence of the Hermite inter-polant on its points of interpolation. However, that is a direct consequence of the well known continuity of fi 7! ffi fi f . Some technical details In <ref> [5] </ref>, [17], there is a discussion about lifting the family of distributions IR k+1 ! S : (x; fi) 7! ffi [x] L fi ; where S is some suitable space of distributions, e.g., C 1 0 (IR), or, in our case, E 0 s (IR) (the space of compactly supported

Reference-contexts: The interpolation conditions for Hakopian's map include evaluation at the points fi.

Integral error formul Observe that f H fi f = D m Thus, to obtain an error formula for H (m) , one might hope to lift the error formula for Hermite interpolation. In this section, this is done in two ways.
