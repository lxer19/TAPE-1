Reference-contexts: Many rely on the assumption of small head motions [8, 10, 11, 15, 20, 22] or require too much processing power [2] for the low-cost, real-time application we have in mind. The methods used are predominantly based on templates [7, 18], feature tracking <ref> [1] </ref>, or optical flow [2, 3, 5, 20, 22]. We have built a system based on tree structured vector quantization (TSVQ) which may meet the cost and speed restrictions for the driving application.

Reference-contexts: Each leaf node contains an in put/output x, y pair. The distance metric is often Euclidean: D (a; b) = (a b) T (a b) . We might anticipate some large outlier images to those in our database and can use a robust error measure instead <ref> [4] </ref>. NN classification is closely related to vector quantization (VQ): given a set of N dimensional inputs x i , produce a mapping onto one of k codes. The only difference is that the output is a not a code j, but a vector y.

Reference-contexts: The goal of such monitoring is highway safety; most traffic fatalities are caused by driver errors, and cars could become safer if they are able to monitor the state of awareness of the driver <ref> [6] </ref>. This particular problem imposes many restrictions which challenge the algorithm designer. The algorithm must be robust to changes in person, appearance, and lighting, and the head position will be initially unknown. The algorithm should be fast, continuously updating the estimated pose approximately every 100 msec.

Reference-contexts: For the complexities of human body pose initialization, these conditions may not be met. Non-parametric estimation techniques include nearest neighbor (NN) estimation techniques, and use techniques closely related to vector quantization <ref> [9] </ref>. In NN techniques, k codes m j = [x j ; y j ]; j = 1; : : : ; k express the input-output mapping simply. <p> When Q is large, one must efficiently index into the large training set. (One can reduce the number of codes by clustering similar points into a common code <ref> [9] </ref>). To reduce indexing costs, the data can be organized into a tree, shown in Figure 1. This technique of organizing codes is known as tree-structured vector quantization (TSVQ). At each node in the tree, a code is stored.

Reference-contexts: Recovering closed-form parametric solutions from first principles is unmanagable. For input spaces with complex structure, however, learning the mapping from inputs to outputs is more tractable. This has been applied to complex input spaces in problems of face detection and recognition <ref> [14, 19] </ref> and to pose estimation for simple figures [17, 16]. Learning the mapping from inputs x to outputs y requires a training set of example pairs (x i ; y i ) that represent typical mappings.

Reference-contexts: Consider binary TSVQ. Given a set of examples (x i ; y i ), the simplest procedure is to split the examples into two piles. k-means clustering, where k = 2 might be used. Alternatively, more robustly, PCA can be used to find the direction of maximal variation (c.f. <ref> [21] </ref>).
