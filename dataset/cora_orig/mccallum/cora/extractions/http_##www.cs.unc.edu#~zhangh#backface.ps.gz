Title: Fast Backface Culling Using Normal Masks

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for fast and efficient backface culling: we reduce the backface test to one logical operation per polygon while requiring only two bytes extra storage per polygon. The normal mask is introduced, where each bit is associated with a cluster of normals in a normal-space partitioning. A polygon's normal is approximated by the cluster of normals in which it falls; the cluster's normal mask is stored with the polygon in a preprocessing step . Although conceptually the normal masks require as many bits as the number of clusters, we observe that only two bytes are actually necessary. For each frame (and for each viewing volume), we calculate the backface mask by ORing the normals masks of all normal clusters that are backfacing. The backface test finally reduces to a single logical AND operation between the polygon's norm al mask and the backface mask.

Reference-contexts: If the result is negative then the polygon is facing towards the viewer; if the result is positive then the polygon is facing away from the viewer and is considered to be backfacing. <ref> [KUMA96] </ref> has proposed a backface culling method that, in theory, can achieve sublinear performance. This method groups polygons and then uses frame-to-frame coherence to identify, track, and cull entire backfacing patches. This method achieves sublinear performance since it culls away polygons by groups. <p> This section briefly describes our normal clustering scheme and then focuses on the method by which these clusters are encoded with normal masks. 2.1 Normal Clustering Grouping normals into clusters is not a new idea. Previously, normal clustering has been used for various purposes, including hierarchical backface culling <ref> [ KUMA96] </ref> and backface culling of curved surfaces [SHIR93]. In these papers, the authors clustered the normal directions in a variety of ways; for example , Shirman partitioned the normal space into "normal cones". Our method is a simple alternative. <p> If a normal cluster is completely inside the backfacing region, then it is marked as a backfacing cluster. Viewing Direction FOV/2 FOV/2 5 DISCUSSION <ref> [KUMA96] </ref> achieves sublinear speedup by discarding groups of polygons as a whole instead of visiting each polygon.

Reference-contexts: Since our backface culling method is currently performed on the host CPU, we are limited to immediate mode graphics; however, it is readily applicable for use in graphics hardware. An implementation of this method has been planned for the geometry processors of PixelFlow <ref> [MOLN92] </ref>; so, when in retained mode, the hardware will perform our backface test when rendering a display list , while requiring only two bytes of extra storage per polygon in the display list.
