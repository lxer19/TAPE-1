Reference-contexts: In addition, the library of input files accompanying XPDP1 is described, and the guidelines to generate new input files are provided. This manual makes no attempt to explain exhaustively the physics and computational issues of particle simulation. Many comprehensive texts on particle simulation are available <ref> [1] </ref> [2]. For information on the Cray FORTRAN version of PDW1, see W. S. Lawson [3]. Some familiarity with plasma physics is required to understand the results of the simulations and generate new simulations.
