Reference-contexts: Although wavelets have their roots in approximation theory [5] and signal processing [13], they have recently been applied to many problems in computer graphics. These graphics applications include image editing <ref> [1] </ref>, image compression [6], and image querying [10]; automatic level-of-detail control for editing and rendering curves and surfaces [7, 8, 12]; surface reconstruction from contours [14]; and fast methods for solving simulation problems in animation [11] and global illumination [3, 4, 9, 15].

Reference-contexts: Each is a generalization to two dimensions of the one-dimensional wavelet transform described in Section 2.1. To obtain the standard decomposition <ref> [2] </ref> of an image, we first apply the one-dimensional wavelet transform to each row of pixel values. This operation gives us an average value along with detail coefficients for each row. <p> The standard decomposition of an image gives coefficients for a basis formed by the standard construction <ref> [2] </ref> of a two-dimensional basis. Similarly, the nonstandard decomposition gives coefficients for the nonstandard construction of basis functions. The standard construction of a two-dimensional wavelet basis consists of all possible tensor products of one-dimensional basis functions.

Reference-contexts: In Part 2, we will present the mathematical theory of multiresolution analysis, then develop spline wavelets and describe their use in multiresolution curve and surface editing. Although wavelets have their roots in approximation theory <ref> [5] </ref> and signal processing [13], they have recently been applied to many problems in computer graphics.

The approach presented here is only introductory; for a more complete treatment of wavelet image compression, see the article by DeVore et al. <ref> [6] </ref>. We can summarize wavelet image compression using the L 2 norm in three steps: 1. Compute coefficients c 1 , : : : , c m representing an image in a nor malized two-dimensional Haar basis. 2. <p> DeVore et al. <ref> [6] </ref> suggest that the L 1 norm is best suited to the task of image compression.

We set the stage here by first presenting the simplest form of wavelets, the Haar basis. We cover one-dimensional wavelet transforms and basis functions, and show how these tools can be used to compress the representation of a piecewise-constant function.
