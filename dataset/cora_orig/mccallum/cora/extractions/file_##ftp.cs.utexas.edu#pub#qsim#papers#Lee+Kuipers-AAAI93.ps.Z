Abstract: We have developed and implemented in the Qportrait program a qualitative simulation based method to construct phase portraits for a significant class of systems of two coupled first order autonomous differential equations, even in the presence of incomplete, qualitative knowledge. Qportrait uses qualitative simulation to generate the set of all possible qualitative behaviors of a system. Constraints on two-dimensional phase portraits from nonlinear dynamics make it possible to identify and classify trajectories and their asymptotic limits, and constrain possible combinations. By exhaustively forming all combinations of features, and filtering out inconsistent combinations, Qportrait is guaranteed to generate all possible qualitative phase portraits. We have applied Qportrait to obtain tractable results for a number of nontrivial dynamical systems. Guaranteed coverage of all possible behaviors of incompletely known systems complements the more detailed, but approximation-based results of recently-developed methods for intelligently-guided numeric simulation [Nishida et al; Sacks; Yip; Zhao]. Combining the strengths of both approaches would better facilitate automated understanding of dynamical systems. This report 1 describes a qualitative simulation based method, implemented in the Qportrait program, to construct phase portraits for a significant class of systems of two first order autonomous differential equations. It is a step towards a useful tool for automated reasoning about dynamical systems (i.e. differential equations), and shows that a dynamical systems perspective can give a tractable overview of a qualitative simulation problem. Differential equations are important for reasoning about physical systems. While nonlinear systems often require complex idiosyncractic treatments, phase potraits have evolved as a powerful tool for global analysis of them. A state of a system is represented by a point in the phase space; change of the system state over time is represented by a trajectory; and a phase portrait is the collection of all possible trajectories of the system. Phase portraits are typically constructed for exactly specified system instances by intelligently choosing samples of trajectories for numeric simulation and interpreting the results. This has led to recent development of numeric methods based reasoning in the phase space [Nishida et al; Sacks; Yip; Zhao]. These approaches are able to give good approxiamte results.

Reference-contexts: When one of the resulting trajectories contains a cyclic path in the envisionment graph, its qualitative description is refined through behavior generation in order to determine possible trends of the cycle (spiral inward, spiral outward, and/or periodic). Envisionment-guided simulation <ref> [Clancy & Kuipers 92] </ref>, the energy filter [Fouche & Kuipers 92], and cycle trend extraction [Lee93], are used for this task. Once cycle trends have been established, incomplete cyclic trajectory fragments can be combined in all consistent ways with connecting fragments to form complete trajectories.

Reference-contexts: Before proceeding to identify asymptotic limits, the envisionment graph is projected onto the phase plane, and states not giving rise to distinctions in the phase plane are removed. These techniques are described in <ref> [Fouche 92] </ref> and [Lee93]. Identifying Asymptotic Limits The complete set of possible asymptotic limits (origins and destinations) of trajectories for autonomous two-dimensional systems with nondegenerate fixed points can be identified from the total envisionment graph. 1. Fixed points are quiescent states in the envisionment graph.

Guarantee of coverage, however, is preserved regardless of the performance of the supporting techniques, though the guarantee becomes increasingly less useful as results become increasingly less tractable.

The method for enforcing non-intersection of qualitative trajectories is described in <ref> [Lee & Kuipers 88] </ref>. All possible non-intersecting combinations of sepa-ratrix sets between saddle points are then formed, and all possible non-intersecting flows are composed into each combination to form all possible qualitative phase portraits. <p> While nonautonomous systems can be transformed into equivalent autonomous systems, systems of higher dimensions will result. Extending Qpor-trait to higher dimensional systems will be difficult, largely because the qualitative non-intersection constraint <ref> [Lee & Kuipers 88] </ref> may not apply generally. Furthermore, trajectory flows and their asymptotic limits have more complicated structures in higher-dimensional systems, and are hard to characterize exhaustively.
