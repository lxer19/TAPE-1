Abstract: Symbolic manipulation of sparse polynomials, given as lists of exponents and nonzero coefficients, appears to be much more complicated than dealing with polynomials in dense encoding (see e.g. [GKS 90, KT 88, P 77a, P 77b]). The first results in this direction are due to Plaisted [P 77a, P 77b], who proved, in particular, the NP-completeness of divisibility of a polynomial x n 1 by a product of sparse polynomials. On the other hand, essentially nothing nontrivial is known about the complexity of the divisibility problem of two sparse integer polynomials. (One can easily prove that it is in PSPACE with the help of [M 86].) Here we prove that nondivisibility of two sparse multivari-able polynomials is in NP, provided that the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH) holds (see e.g. [LO 77]). The divisibility problem is closely related to the rational interpolation problem (whose decidability and complexity bound are determined in [GKS 90]). In this setting we assume that a rational function is given by a black box for evaluating it. We prove also that the problem of deciding whether a rational function given by a black box equals a polynomial belongs to the parallel class NC, provided the ERH holds and moreover, that we know the degree of some sparse rational representation of it.

Reference-contexts: The lemma is proved. 2 One can construct in NC the integer t 4dt 2 (<ref> [BCH 86] </ref>), then by Lemma 2 an integer larger than 2 M=2t and again using [BCH 86] an integer larger than 2 M . Then the algorithm constructs an integer N 0 &gt; 362 3M d 5 . Finally, the algorithm yields the number N = q (q (N 0 )).

Reference-contexts: Taking into account the bounds l (h), l h m f M + d that apply to factors of g, f , respectively, we obtain l (u), l (v) M d O (1) by virtue of the bounds on the bit-size of minors of the Sylvester matrix (see e.g. <ref> [CG 82, L 82, M 82] </ref>). Let us rewrite the equality in the following way: w 0 = u 0 h+v 0 h m f , where w 0 2 ZZ, u 0 , v 0 2 ZZ [x].

Reference-contexts: Hypothesis holds. 2 Divisibility problem for sparse rational func tion given by a black-box The proposition 1 can be improved if t-sparse f , g 2 ZZ [X 1 ; : : : ; X n ] are not ex-plicitely given, but we only have a black box (see e.g. <ref> [GK 91, GKS 90] </ref>) for the rational function f =g provided that lc X 1 (g) = 1 and a bound on d is given. <p> This is due to the fact that in the one-variable case we need only a bound on M which one can get even by the parallel algorithm N C from a black-box relying on the construction from <ref> [GK 91] </ref> of a big enough number. To do this we proceed as follows. <p> Then the algorithm constructs an integer N 0 &gt; 362 3M d 5 . Finally, the algorithm yields the number N = q (q (N 0 )). We claim that N is big enough (see <ref> [GK 91] </ref>), namely, divide with the remainder f = eg + rem (f; g), then for each integer N 1 N we have 0 &lt; j rem (f;g) g (N 1 )j &lt; 1 2 , provided that rem (f; g) 6= 0. Let us prove the claim.
