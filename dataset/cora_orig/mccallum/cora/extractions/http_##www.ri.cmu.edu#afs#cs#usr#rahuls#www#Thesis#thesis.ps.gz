Reference-contexts: This description of human cognitive activity can also involve aspects from utility theory generally in the form of a perceived risk factor. Although some efforts have been made to specify motivational models in a symbolic programming language <ref> [1] </ref>, no successful implementation currently exists. In Mono-SAPIENT (See Chapter 4), discrete internal states, analogous to mental states here, are used to differentiate the different modes of driving (e.g., car following vs lane-changing behavior). 22 CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: Other control models have been developed in the traffic simulation domain. The ones of most interest to tactical driving research are those which model lane-changing <ref> [116, 2] </ref>, car following [124], and emergency maneuvers [3]. Since these models are computational, they can be directly incorporated into tactical reasoning system, as described in Chapters 4 and 5. 2.1. <p> Note that when t &lt; 0, the gap is moving away from the robot. Also, when jtj is small, j1=tj can be very large. To avoid the asymptotes, the current implementation of MonoSAPIENT limits this attribute to the range <ref> [2; 2] </ref>. Expected Size: This is an estimate of the gap's size at the time of arrival, based on its current size, and its current rate of growth.

Reference-contexts: This point on the road determines the steering curvature that should be used to steer the vehicle onto the desired trajectory at the specified look-ahead distance (l). terface is based on the ALVINN [73] road follower and provides information about the local road geometry through a pure-pursuit <ref> [114, 4] </ref> point (See Figure 3.7). A pure-pursuit point is defined to be the intersection of the desired vehicle trajectory and a circle of radius (l), centered at the vehicle's rear axle midpoint (assuming front wheel steer). <p> The look-ahead distance is an empirically determined pa 46 CHAPTER 3. THE SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT rameter which corresponds to the gain of the steering controller. When l is too short, vehicle control may become unstable; when l is too long, the controller response is sluggish. Experiments on the Navlab vehicles <ref> [4, 73] </ref> have shown that good results are obtained when l = 15 meters in low speed situations and l = 25 meters at highway speeds. Human factors studies have also demonstrated that the pure-pursuit model approximates the human steering response [82].

Reference-contexts: As Rosenblatt [84] discussed, decentralized systems connected using voting arbiters have wide applicability in the field of mobile robots. However, SAPIENT-like architectures need not be restricted to physical domains. An interesting potential application for these systems is in rich, collaborative, virtual environments containing avatars <ref> [5, 42] </ref>. Avatars are virtual puppets representing users or programs in the system, that interact with the shared environment (and other avatars) in a quasi-realistic manner. Computer-controlled avatars need to respond to a variety of stimuli in real-time, while furthering their own internal goals.

Reference-contexts: Since the arbitration is not localized (unlike PolySAPIENT's single voting arbiter), this modification process is nontrivial. The potential field techniques [58, 53], fuzzy control [49, 126], and schemabased methods <ref> [6] </ref> use a different approach to command fusion: the arbiter does not select between the outputs of different modules, but rather combines them.

Reference-contexts: DRIVER MODELS 19 A case study, known as the Munich Taxicab Experiment <ref> [7] </ref> was conducted to test the implications of risk homeostasis theory under controlled conditions. Some vehicles in a taxi fleet were equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS) that allowed drivers to maintain steering control during hard braking on slippery roads. <p> Some vehicles in a taxi fleet were equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS) that allowed drivers to maintain steering control during hard braking on slippery roads. Conventional wisdom predicted that the ABS-equipped vehicles would be safer than unequipped vehicles. Surprisingly, the results showed that: <ref> [7, 120] </ref>: * Among the accidents involving the company's taxis, there was no statistically significant difference between the involvement rate of the two vehicle types (in fact, the ABS vehicles were involved in slightly more accidents). * Accident severity was independent of the presence or absence of ABS in the taxi.

Reference-contexts: in the context of tactical-level reasoning, risk homeostasis theory provides support for utility-based approaches to situation awareness (See Chapter 5). 2.1.3 Perceptual and Motivational Models Perception models have been used to describe driver behavior in accidents [109], suggest methods for safer driving [117, 118] and motivate new collision warning devices <ref> [8] </ref>. In the tactical driving domain, perceptual models are particularly relevant in two areas: sensor modeling and driver intentions. Sensor modeling at the operational level is primarily concerned with tracking objects and segmentation (low-level actions which humans typically take for granted). <p> Thus, unless A is able to anticipate the danger and increase headway before seeing C, a collision is unavoidable. Humans have two defenses against such conditions: 1) they see several cars ahead, through windshields <ref> [8] </ref>; 2) they use domain knowledge to predict likely places for such incidents, such as entrances to shopping malls, or driveways. Given these harsh conditions, I was very surprised to find that PolySAPIENT is able to successfully negotiates these scenarios reliably, even under challenging circumstances.

Reference-contexts: The researchers claim that the ability to explain why the agent made critical decisions is vital in demonstrating the system's situation awareness. Other work in this area includes a proposed Information Manager for pilot decision support [95] and a proposal for a blackboard architecture-based combat helicopter system <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.2 Situation Awareness in Driving To see how SA theories originating in tactical combat may be applied to tactical-level driving, it is instructive to note the similarities between air-to-air combat and navigating in traffic. First, both tasks require real-time reasoning in dynamic, uncertain environments.

Reference-contexts: I introduce a method relying on three components: 1) an evolutionary algorithm, termed PBIL (Population Based Incremental Learning) <ref> [14] </ref>; 2) a user-defined evaluation function which describes the de 12 CHAPTER 1.

The object of the algorithm is to create a real-valued probability vector which, when sampled, reveals high quality candidate solutions with a high probability. Like a GA, PBIL optimizes a black-box evaluation function by iteratively sampling the function at a number of points in parallel.

Reference-contexts: System a concept where large numbers of intelligent vehicles could be used to improve highway capacities and reduce traffic accidents. 1.2 The Automated Highway System The proposal for an Automated Highway System (AHS) consists of intelligent vehicles operating on a roadway that is free of pedestrians and traffic control devices <ref> [15, 65, 89, 91] </ref>. All vehicles enter the AHS under human control. Following a successful check-in procedure, the intelligent vehicles switch to computer control. While on the AHS, the automated vehicles travel at high speeds, possibly with reduced headways, until they reach their destination exit.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, current mobile robot architectures recognize that planning-heavy approaches to real-time problems in dynamic environments (such as driving in traffic) are infeasible <ref> [18, 84] </ref>. MonoSAPIENT recognizes the critical role of perception in tactical driving and makes reasonable assumptions about available information (See Section 4.4). By abandoning the hope of generating complete plans 66 CHAPTER 4. <p> The command arbiter must integrate these inputs into a coherent response. A number of different command fusion methods have been developed to address this issue. 5.4.1 Related Work in Command Fusion In the subsumption architecture <ref> [18] </ref>, all modules (known as behaviors) are active at all times and process the sensor data. Each behavior individually determines whether it is applicable to the current situation at which point it sends control commands to the robot. 5.4.

Reference-contexts: The competence of this implementation depends largely on the sophistication in the MonoSAPI-ENT decision tree. Unfortunately, the cognition states and interactions between the various rules explode exponentially in such monolithic systems as new functions are implemented <ref> [21] </ref>. Additionally, modifying the decision tree requires large numbers of non-local modifications an error-prone and time-consuming task for researchers. To address these deficiencies, a distributed implementation of the reasoning system is proposed. Chapter 5 details the distributed implementation of SAPIENT, termed PolySAPIENT. <p> Points represented in road coordinates can be seamlessly expressed in world coordinates as necessary. SHIVA's notion of real-valued lane displacement (rather than integral lane numbers) is a feature lacking in many existing traffic simulators <ref> [21] </ref> and allows accurate modeling of lane change maneuvers. Some realistic simulators [80, 28, 41], while modeling continuous lateral motion, still ignore the impact of lane tracking on vehicle orientation (i.e., they assume that the vehicle is always parallel to the local tangent of the road). <p> SYSTEM OVERVIEW 63 Previous work in tactical-level driving has concentrated on expressing driving knowledge in the form of rules [69, 57], decision trees [80], or finite state machines <ref> [21] </ref>. <p> At the tactical level, it is reasonable to expect that perception systems can reliably track traffic entities such as vehicles, lanes and exits along with information about the entity such as the speed of a vehicle or the distance to an exit. Thus, previous work in tactical driving <ref> [80, 21, 57] </ref> has generally assumed that the intelligent vehicle has a perfect model of its surroundings. <p> The following disadvantages can be identified. First, as illustrated above, creating realistic rules requires the designer to account for many complex factors. Second, a small change in the desired system behavior generally requires many non-local modifications (also noted in <ref> [21] </ref>). Third, the hand-coded rules perform poorly in unanticipated situations. And finally, implementing new features requires one to consider an large number of interactions with existing rules.

Reference-contexts: Research in the 1960s focused on the problem of semi-autonomous vehicle control with promising results [35, 70, 19] 1 . Significant progress was made when vision-based lane-trackers were integrated with vehicle control systems, enabling robot cars to drive on clear highways under controlled circumstances <ref> [23, 54, 73] </ref>.

Although lane tracking is a challenging robotics problem <ref> [23, 54, 73] </ref>, most highway simulations [122, 69] still equate lane tracking and lane occupancy. Such simulations model lane changes as instantaneous actions, allowing their cognition modules to completely ignore the difficult decisions needed during lane changing and fail to capture behaviors such as lane straddling and aborted lane changes.

INTRODUCTION Mobile robot research has addressed these three levels to different degrees. Strategic-level route-guidance has been successfully tackled using standard AI search techniques on digital maps using GPS positioning information <ref> [24, 100, 83, 113] </ref>. Operational-level systems have become increasingly robust, allowing intelligent vehicles to be reliably controlled on real highways [106, 63, 36, 62].

Reference-contexts: Chapter 7 classifies tactical-level scenarios collected from real-life situations and examines the cognitive processing required to solve them. Scenarios have been successfully used in situation awareness literature to evaluate SA in human experts <ref> [25, 32, 90, 94, 86] </ref>. I extend this approach to assessing SA in tactical reasoning systems. <p> The primary example of such a theory is situation awareness (SA), described as: [An expert's] perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future <ref> [25] </ref>. Situation awareness was first discussed in connection with pilot performance in air-to-air combat and was seen as the critical difference between fighter aces and ordinary pilots [45, 50, 87, 72]. <p> For instance, in Endsley's model, the cognitive processing involved in SA is divided into three levels <ref> [25, 26] </ref>. At the information level, the agent detects the target cue or object in the environment. This corresponds to PolySAPIENT's perceptual processing where reasoning objects are instantiated in response to observed traffic entities. At the interpretation level, this information is processed and integrated into an assessment of the situation. <p> Methods for evaluating situation awareness have been divided into three broad categories [33, 88]: Explicit performance measures: (e.g., SAGAT: SA Global Assessment Technique <ref> [25] </ref>). Here, a simulated mission is stopped at arbitrary points during the run, and the agent is questioned about the current situation. The answers are later compared with what was actually happening, and the agreement between the two is used as a measure of the agent's situation awareness. <p> Key Concepts: Deciding whether a lane change is feasible. A difficult test of the agent's ability to predict the future. Measures of Success: 1) No collisions; 2) Successful exit; 3) Main taining a reasonable velocity. Results: The third facet of situation awareness, according to Endsley's definition <ref> [25] </ref> is the projection of . . . status in the near future. This is extremely difficult in the dynamic, incomplete, noisy domain of tactical driving.

Reference-contexts: According to situation awareness theories, Car A's driver has been monitoring several entities in the traffic scene for some time (such as Car B, the desired exit, and vehicles in the passing lane), and has formed expectations on how the scenario will unfold over time <ref> [26] </ref>. This information enables the driver to select an appropriate maneuver. My thesis research develops cognition systems for intelligent vehicles that demonstrate a similar situation awareness. The problem of navigating in traffic should be examined in the context of the entire driving task. <p> For instance, in Endsley's model, the cognitive processing involved in SA is divided into three levels <ref> [25, 26] </ref>. At the information level, the agent detects the target cue or object in the environment. This corresponds to PolySAPIENT's perceptual processing where reasoning objects are instantiated in response to observed traffic entities. At the interpretation level, this information is processed and integrated into an assessment of the situation.

Reference-contexts: A danger with using functional sensor models is that the simulator may provide unrealistically complete data of the environment. This tendency is common in earlier work in tactical simulation. For example: perfect measurement of sensed vehicles' acceleration [69]; transparent vehicles [80]; and straight road assumptions <ref> [27] </ref>. SHIVA's functional sensors only return information that is available given existing perception technology assumptions. 3.5.2 Lane Trackers Since realistic lane tracking is an operational level task (and beyond the scope of this simulation), SHIVA's lane tracking module is a functional model of a complete vision-based lane tracking system.

Reference-contexts: Simulators are generally created to study traffic patterns and consequently fail to provide adequate facilities for adding or debugging new vehicle control algorithms. Few simulators are available for tactical-level research 1 . Of these, Pharos [81], SmartPath <ref> [28] </ref>, and SmartAHS [41] possess most of the necessary characteristics: microscopic vehicle modeling, support for different road geometries, and realistic lane changing models. Unfortunately, since none of these tools were designed specifically for tactical-level simulation, each has significant deficiencies in the area. <p> Points represented in road coordinates can be seamlessly expressed in world coordinates as necessary. SHIVA's notion of real-valued lane displacement (rather than integral lane numbers) is a feature lacking in many existing traffic simulators [21] and allows accurate modeling of lane change maneuvers. Some realistic simulators <ref> [80, 28, 41] </ref>, while modeling continuous lateral motion, still ignore the impact of lane tracking on vehicle orientation (i.e., they assume that the vehicle is always parallel to the local tangent of the road). Unfortunately these effects are relevant during lane changing.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, if Car B were to speed up during the passing maneuver (in an attempt to prevent overtaking), the final right lane change would have to be delayed. For these reasons, the mobile robot community has moved towards architectures that emphasize interleaved planning and execution <ref> [30, 29] </ref> where, rather than searching completely to the goal state, the robot generates a partial plan and begins execution, possibly re-planning from the current state at every new time-step [84].

Reference-contexts: Driving in traffic is very difficult for intelligent vehicles because good decisions need to be made given only incomplete information, in real time. Standard AI techniques such as search-based planning <ref> [30] </ref> are infeasible for several reasons. First, the effects of the robot's actions on the environment (especially other vehicles) cannot be determined. Second, most of these methods cannot function under noisy, uncertain conditions. <p> Before examining the details of the system, I present a brief look at mobile robot architectures and indicate the forces which motivated MonoSAPIENT's design. 4.3 Mobile Robot Architectures The traditional approach to robotics <ref> [30] </ref> involves a three-stage processing cycle as shown in Figure 4.1. In the first stage, sensors gather information about the world and convert it to a symbolic internal representation, known as a world model. <p> Similarly, if Car B were to speed up during the passing maneuver (in an attempt to prevent overtaking), the final right lane change would have to be delayed. For these reasons, the mobile robot community has moved towards architectures that emphasize interleaved planning and execution <ref> [30, 29] </ref> where, rather than searching completely to the goal state, the robot generates a partial plan and begins execution, possibly re-planning from the current state at every new time-step [84].

Before the invention of the automobile, most forms of human transportation were, in some sense, intelligent. For example, a rider could rely on a horse's self-preservation instincts to avoid obstacles, or its sense of direction to find the way home [98]. <p> Its scenario creation features are used in Chapter 7 to create tactical scenarios for intelligent vehicles. Chapter 4 MonoSAPIENT: Rule-Based Situation Awareness The function of the expert is not to be more right than other people, but to be wrong for more sophisticated reasons. Dr. David Butler <ref> [31] </ref> Chapter 2 presented the idea of a situation awareness (SA) based tactical reasoning system, termed SAPIENT (Situation Awareness Planner Implementing Effective Navigation in Traffic).

Reference-contexts: Simulators are generally created to study traffic patterns and consequently fail to provide adequate facilities for adding or debugging new vehicle control algorithms. Few simulators are available for tactical-level research 1 . Of these, Pharos [81], SmartPath [28], and SmartAHS <ref> [41] </ref> possess most of the necessary characteristics: microscopic vehicle modeling, support for different road geometries, and realistic lane changing models. Unfortunately, since none of these tools were designed specifically for tactical-level simulation, each has significant deficiencies in the area. <p> Points represented in road coordinates can be seamlessly expressed in world coordinates as necessary. SHIVA's notion of real-valued lane displacement (rather than integral lane numbers) is a feature lacking in many existing traffic simulators [21] and allows accurate modeling of lane change maneuvers. Some realistic simulators <ref> [80, 28, 41] </ref>, while modeling continuous lateral motion, still ignore the impact of lane tracking on vehicle orientation (i.e., they assume that the vehicle is always parallel to the local tangent of the road). Unfortunately these effects are relevant during lane changing. <p> One way to accomplish this is to build the simulator on top of a persistent database (e.g., SmartAHS <ref> [41] </ref> is built over Versant). The biggest advantage of this is that state is implicitly saved (allowing rewinding of the simulation on demand).

Reference-contexts: As Rosenblatt [84] discussed, decentralized systems connected using voting arbiters have wide applicability in the field of mobile robots. However, SAPIENT-like architectures need not be restricted to physical domains. An interesting potential application for these systems is in rich, collaborative, virtual environments containing avatars <ref> [5, 42] </ref>. Avatars are virtual puppets representing users or programs in the system, that interact with the shared environment (and other avatars) in a quasi-realistic manner. Computer-controlled avatars need to respond to a variety of stimuli in real-time, while furthering their own internal goals.

Reference-contexts: The controllers generate steering wheel position and throttle/brake commands to bring current vehicle curvature and velocity to the desired positions as quickly as possible. The controller also enforces limits on acceleration and rate of change of curvature. Experiments on the Navlab <ref> [73, 47] </ref> indicate that a bandwidth of 10 Hz is required for highway driving using this controller.

The operational-level control for lane changing has been studied in depth <ref> [77, 123, 47] </ref>, and is not discussed further in this thesis. Unlike most tactical-level reasoning systems, which assume that the commanded lane change always succeeds, MonoSAPIENT actively monitors the progress of the maneuver to determine whether the lane change should be aborted.

Reference-contexts: SHIVA also supports lane trackers that actively steer the vehicle. By varying the desired lateral offset (represented by a pure-pursuit point) smoothly from the center of one lane to the center of the desired adjacent lane, these road followers are able to implement lane changes <ref> [48] </ref>. It is important to note that the actual lateral offset of the vehicle always lags the current position of its pure-pursuit point during the lane change. 3.6. COGNITION 47 3.5.3 Positioning SHIVA simulates two types of positioning sensors: dead reckoning and global positioning systems (GPS). <p> Since the operational-level controller automatically servos the steering angle to bear towards the pure-pursuit point, this strategy leads to a smooth lane change, as shown in Figure 4.9. A similar approach has been demonstrated on the Navlab robot <ref> [48] </ref>. Thus, for lane-changing, once a suitable gap has been chosen, MonoS-APIENT transitions into the appropriate lane changing mode. This commands the operational-level controller to match velocities with the 5 The distance to the pure-pursuit point is constant in time (e.g., 1.5 seconds ahead of the intelligent vehicle). 4.7.

Internally, these reasoning objects construct a time-to-impact potential field around the relevant obstacle (similar to the generalized potential fields used in <ref> [59] </ref>). The vote against a particular action is inversely proportional to the estimated time-to-impact. Thus, such a reasoning object will prefer braking to accelerating when it sees a stationary obstacle ahead in its lane since decelerating will increase the time-to-impact.

MonoSAPIENT represents each category explicitly as a global mode. Lane tracking: The vehicle is in a relatively clear lane and is able to travel at its desired velocity. Lane tracking systems are responsi ble for lateral control. <p> Thus, the intelligent vehicle is forced to make some hypotheses about the vehicles' intentions. Experienced human drivers can often predict the behavior of other drivers with surprising accuracy <ref> [66] </ref>. However, this involves both a large database of world knowledge (presumably unavailable to the intelligent vehicle) as well as perception well beyond the current state of the art in computer vision.

Reference-contexts: Research in the 1960s focused on the problem of semi-autonomous vehicle control with promising results [35, 70, 19] 1 . Significant progress was made when vision-based lane-trackers were integrated with vehicle control systems, enabling robot cars to drive on clear highways under controlled circumstances <ref> [23, 54, 73] </ref>. Simultaneously, research in automatic headway control [16, 22] and convoying [34, 55] led to vehicles capable of autonomous car following [52, 101]. <p> The intelligent vehicles are designed to be largely compatible with the Carnegie Mellon Navlab [106, 76] robot vehicles (See Figure 3.3). Over the last decade, the Navlab robots have been used as testbeds for a large variety of experiments in autonomous navigation <ref> [61, 73, 101, 104, 74] </ref>. Since many of the systems that have emerged from this research will be critical in the automated highway system project, SHIVA minimizes the modifications needed to port cognition modules to the robot. <p> The in 3.5.

THE SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT rameter which corresponds to the gain of the steering controller. When l is too short, vehicle control may become unstable; when l is too long, the controller response is sluggish. Experiments on the Navlab vehicles <ref> [4, 73] </ref> have shown that good results are obtained when l = 15 meters in low speed situations and l = 25 meters at highway speeds. Human factors studies have also demonstrated that the pure-pursuit model approximates the human steering response [82]. <p> Human factors studies have also demonstrated that the pure-pursuit model approximates the human steering response [82]. Although lane tracking is a challenging robotics problem <ref> [23, 54, 73] </ref>, most highway simulations [122, 69] still equate lane tracking and lane occupancy. Such simulations model lane changes as instantaneous actions, allowing their cognition modules to completely ignore the difficult decisions needed during lane changing and fail to capture behaviors such as lane straddling and aborted lane changes. <p> The controllers generate steering wheel position and throttle/brake commands to bring current vehicle curvature and velocity to the desired positions as quickly as possible. The controller also enforces limits on acceleration and rate of change of curvature. Experiments on the Navlab <ref> [73, 47] </ref> indicate that a bandwidth of 10 Hz is required for highway driving using this controller. Thus, SHIVA uses a fixed time-step of 100ms and expects that cognition modules will provide a C at each time-step. <p> Short-term planning enables real-time decision making based on incomplete world models. 4.4 Perceptual Processing In an intelligent vehicle, most of the problems associated with sensing are addressed at the operational level. For example, vision-based lane trackers automatically deal with variations in lighting conditions <ref> [73] </ref> and positioning systems combine noisy inputs from several sources [105]. <p> The perception modules (depicted as ellipses) are connected to the intelligent vehicle's sensors, and perform functions such as lane tracking or vehicle detection. Wherever possible, they correspond to existing systems available on the Carnegie Mellon Navlab (e.g., the lane tracker is based on ALVINN <ref> [73] </ref>). Each reasoning object (shown as a dark rectangle) obtains information about the situation from one or two perception modules, and independently calculates the utility of various courses of action. This information is then sent to the voting arbiter, which integrates these recommendations and selects the appropriate response. <p> This section describes how the current implementation of PolySAPIENT converts its actions into a Navlab-compatible form (desired steering curvature and velocity). 5.6.1 Lateral Control The operational-level road-following in a Navlab vehicle is typically performed by a lane-tracker such as ALVINN <ref> [73] </ref> or RALPH [74]. Both of these vision-based systems rely on a low-latency loop to maintain the vehicle's desired lateral position. Feeding each curvature command through the tactical-level processing is impractical since any delays in reasoning would jeopardize basic vehicle safety. <p> Confucius The fact that humans learn to drive, and improve with experience suggests that an intelligent vehicle could acquire situation awareness through repeated exposure to traffic situations. Although machine learning has been successfully applied to operational-level tasks, such as lane-tracking <ref> [73, 74] </ref> and trailer-truck docking [119], very few systems have applied learning to tactical-level driving. 129 130 CHAPTER 6. LEARNING SITUATION AWARENESS 6.1 Applying Learning to Tactical Driving Learning strategies can be broadly classified into two types: supervised and unsupervised. <p> In some domains, immediate feedback on the worth of an action is available. This is especially true if the system is receiving instruction from a human teacher. For example, in ALVINN <ref> [73] </ref>, the difference between the lane-tracker's steering direction and the human driver's steering command is used to generate an error vector. By contrast, in the experiments described here, the absence of an instructor prevents the simulator from assigning an evaluation to individual tactical-level actions. However, the ac 138 CHAPTER 6. <p> When the vehicle is correctly centered in the lane, this object votes positively for all actions that maintain the current lateral position. When the vehicle moves out of its lane (during lane changing), the vehicle reasoning object monitors the motion of the lane-tracker's pure-pursuit point <ref> [114, 73] </ref> and votes positively for actions that continue moving the pure-pursuit point towards the new lane. Once the pure-pursuit point is close to the new lane, the lane reasoning object changes its local state to lane-keeping.

Reference-contexts: A second difficulty with most task models is that, like proverbs 2 , the recommendations are often contradictory. As Reece <ref> [80] </ref> observes, the McKnight and Adams task list includes two subtasks that instruct drivers to observe pedestrians and playing children and to ignore activity on the sidewalk that has no impact on driving without providing insights as to which sidewalk activities have no impact on driving. <p> Since time constraints prevent processing all of this information at every time instant, the agent must intelligently select the information most critical to the immediate task. Reece addressed the issue of information overload for robot driving through selective perception <ref> [80] </ref>. His system, Ulysses, exploited the fact that reasoning could be simplified by first focusing on those objects in the environment that most constrain the agent's available actions. <p> Points represented in road coordinates can be seamlessly expressed in world coordinates as necessary. SHIVA's notion of real-valued lane displacement (rather than integral lane numbers) is a feature lacking in many existing traffic simulators [21] and allows accurate modeling of lane change maneuvers. Some realistic simulators <ref> [80, 28, 41] </ref>, while modeling continuous lateral motion, still ignore the impact of lane tracking on vehicle orientation (i.e., they assume that the vehicle is always parallel to the local tangent of the road). Unfortunately these effects are relevant during lane changing. <p> Segmentation, tracking and velocity calculations need to be performed by the perception module. cognition modules as needed during tactical maneuvers to provide relevant information about surrounding traffic. Since perception is expensive, this selective perception enables cognition modules to minimize the computational load <ref> [80] </ref>. Range Sensors SHIVA's range sensor is a 1-D scanning laser sensor with a user-defined range ( max ), field of view ( max ) and resolution (given by number of rays, n). Vehicles may have different sensors with individual characteristics, mounted on different locations. <p> A danger with using functional sensor models is that the simulator may provide unrealistically complete data of the environment. This tendency is common in earlier work in tactical simulation. For example: perfect measurement of sensed vehicles' acceleration [69]; transparent vehicles <ref> [80] </ref>; and straight road assumptions [27]. <p> SYSTEM OVERVIEW 63 Previous work in tactical-level driving has concentrated on expressing driving knowledge in the form of rules [69, 57], decision trees <ref> [80] </ref>, or finite state machines [21]. <p> In the final stage, this plan is executed by the robot as a series of actions (actuator commands).

Reference-contexts: Consequently, current mobile robot architectures recognize that planning-heavy approaches to real-time problems in dynamic environments (such as driving in traffic) are infeasible <ref> [18, 84] </ref>. MonoSAPIENT recognizes the critical role of perception in tactical driving and makes reasonable assumptions about available information (See Section 4.4). By abandoning the hope of generating complete plans 66 CHAPTER 4. <p> For these reasons, the mobile robot community has moved towards architectures that emphasize interleaved planning and execution [30, 29] where, rather than searching completely to the goal state, the robot generates a partial plan and begins execution, possibly re-planning from the current state at every new time-step <ref> [84] </ref>. Not only does this make real-time planning tractable, but it also allows the reasoning system to integrate the latest information, without committing the robot to potentially incorrect plans. The following sections detail important aspects in the triggering and execution of the lane change. 4.7. <p> ACTION SELECTION 111 Unfortunately, the naive combination of commands using vector sums leads to serious problems in the tactical driving domain. First, some of these methods (notably potential field approaches) are prone to local minima <ref> [84] </ref>. For example, a force motivating a vehicle to speed up (to finish an overtaking maneuver) may balance a decelerating force due to a speed limit causing the intelligent vehicle to drive in the blocker's blind spot. <p> The simple addition of these two command choices would result in the vector (+1, 0) which corresponds to driving straight between the two choices, and thus off the road. PolySAPIENT's command fusion approach is largely motivated by the Distributed Architecture for Mobile Navigation (DAMN) <ref> [84] </ref>, an arbiter used successfully to integrate a variety of cognition modules in several Navlab II [106] cross-country navigation projects. In DAMN, different modules express preferences for vehicle actions (commonly encoded either as raw steering curvatures, or as vehicle positions in a local map) with positive and negative votes. <p> CONCLUSION 8.2.3 Reasoning Objects in Other Domains The idea of a loosely coupled, heterogenous architecture for distributed intelligence can be applied to a broad class of problems beyond driving in traffic. As Rosenblatt <ref> [84] </ref> discussed, decentralized systems connected using voting arbiters have wide applicability in the field of mobile robots. However, SAPIENT-like architectures need not be restricted to physical domains. An interesting potential application for these systems is in rich, collaborative, virtual environments containing avatars [5, 42].

Reference-contexts: HUMAN DRIVING STRATEGIES Situation awareness theory has motivated intelligent systems in other domains. TacAir-Soar <ref> [85] </ref> is an intelligent automated agent for simulated fighter planes. The goal of the project is to develop automated pilots whose behavior in simulated battlefields is indistinguishable from experienced human pilots. Current versions have demonstrated some competence in one-on-one scenarios similar to those used in real training missions. <p> While these reasoning systems have only explored greatly simplified aspects of the driving task (e.g., Niehaus & Stengel assume curve free roads while Kotchetkov assumes single-lane highways), expert systems have been used in other fields with promising results <ref> [78, 85] </ref>. 4.2 System Overview At the tactical level, intelligent vehicle behavior falls under three broad categories [66]. MonoSAPIENT represents each category explicitly as a global mode. Lane tracking: The vehicle is in a relatively clear lane and is able to travel at its desired velocity. <p> For the first two methods, this is relatively straightforward. However, the third (subjective) assumes that the agent is capable of a high degree of introspection currently beyond the scope of most AI systems. While TacAir-Soar <ref> [85] </ref> agents can be debriefed using a natural language interface, it is unclear whether they are able to accurately assess their own degree of situation awareness 1 . Nearly all methods used to evaluate SA in humans rely on the notion of a scenario.

Reference-contexts: EVALUATING TACTICAL DRIVING in other domains. 7.1 Assessing Situation Awareness While situation awareness has long been anecdotally correlated with competence, attempts to quantitatively assess an agent's SA are relatively recent. Methods for evaluating situation awareness have been divided into three broad categories <ref> [33, 88] </ref>: Explicit performance measures: (e.g., SAGAT: SA Global Assessment Technique [25]). Here, a simulated mission is stopped at arbitrary points during the run, and the agent is questioned about the current situation. <p> The answers are later compared with what was actually happening, and the agreement between the two is used as a measure of the agent's situation awareness. Implicit performance measures: This involves the design of experimental scenarios that include tasks and events that probe <ref> [111, 88] </ref> the agent's situation awareness. The method assumes a direct relationship between SA and performance. Subjective ratings: (e.g., SART: Situation Awareness Rating Technique [112]). In this approach, agents are immersed in a challenging scenario requiring a high degree of situation awareness. <p> To solve the scenario, the agent must demonstrate the ability to achieve its goals while successfully reacting to low-level concerns (e.g., other cars), as perceived by 1 Some critics claim that no agent, human or automated, is capable of assessing its own degree of SA through introspection <ref> [88] </ref>. 154 CHAPTER 7.

Thus, the position of a sensed vehicle is represented not as a single point, but rather as an uncertainty ellipse.

However, the tactical level, critical to the deployment of intelligent vehicles, has not been rigorously addressed. 1.4 Thesis Overview In this dissertation, I present solutions to the tactical driving task. <p> SAPIENT (Situation Awareness Planner Implementing Effective Navigation in Traffic) is conceived as a tactical system interfacing with existing perception and control modules on the Carnegie Mellon Navlab <ref> [106] </ref> robots. While SAPIENT is designed to be implemented on the Navlab, real traffic is (at least initially), an unsuitable testbed for several reasons. First, exploring new tactical algorithms in close proximity to other vehicles at high speeds is obviously unsafe. <p> Three vehicle classes are modeled, each with its own physical characteristics (See Figure 3.2). The intelligent vehicles are designed to be largely compatible with the Carnegie Mellon Navlab <ref> [106, 76] </ref> robot vehicles (See Figure 3.3). Over the last decade, the Navlab robots have been used as testbeds for a large variety of experiments in autonomous navigation [61, 73, 101, 104, 74]. <p> PolySAPIENT's command fusion approach is largely motivated by the Distributed Architecture for Mobile Navigation (DAMN) [84], an arbiter used successfully to integrate a variety of cognition modules in several Navlab II <ref> [106] </ref> cross-country navigation projects. In DAMN, different modules express preferences for vehicle actions (commonly encoded either as raw steering curvatures, or as vehicle positions in a local map) with positive and negative votes.

Reference-contexts: The notion of a driver's internal state is central to motivational models. In this framework, perceptual information is integrated with discrete mental states in an attempt to predict the actions that a human driver would take in that given situation <ref> [108] </ref>. This description of human cognitive activity can also involve aspects from utility theory generally in the form of a perceived risk factor. Although some efforts have been made to specify motivational models in a symbolic programming language [1], no successful implementation currently exists.

Reference-contexts: Intelligent vehicles may improve highway capacities in the following ways. First, intelligent vehicles could drive with reduced headways (in extreme cases, as small as one meter <ref> [110] </ref>), greatly increasing highway throughput. Second, the intelligent vehicles could help damp out traffic waves caused by abrupt acceleration and braking on the highway. Third, the intelligent vehicles could all be instructed to travel at a speed that is globally optimal for highway throughput. <p> Some advocate that all vehicles on the AHS be computer-controlled (dedicated-lane concepts) while others allow autonomous and human-controlled vehicles to share the highway (mixed-traffic concepts). In the former, the intelligent vehicles can rely on protocols established using communication with the infrastructure and other smart cars (as described in <ref> [110] </ref>) to execute lane-changing and exit maneuvers. In the latter, the intelligent vehicles must compe 1.3.

Reference-contexts: For example, the well-known Two-Second Rule for car following [92] is based on the observation that humans require approximately 1:75 seconds to identify and react to a potentially dangerous situation [66]. Lane-keeping and steering models such as pure-pursuit tracking <ref> [114] </ref> are valuable at the tactical-level. First, such models can help the intelligent vehicle predict the future likely positions of observed vehicles. Second, such models can allow the reasoning system to estimate the time needed to execute a given maneuver (such as a lane change). <p> This point on the road determines the steering curvature that should be used to steer the vehicle onto the desired trajectory at the specified look-ahead distance (l). terface is based on the ALVINN [73] road follower and provides information about the local road geometry through a pure-pursuit <ref> [114, 4] </ref> point (See Figure 3.7). A pure-pursuit point is defined to be the intersection of the desired vehicle trajectory and a circle of radius (l), centered at the vehicle's rear axle midpoint (assuming front wheel steer). <p> PolySAPIENT's paradigm for lateral control is to manipulate the active lane-tracking system's steering behavior. Although the neural-net 5.6. ACTION EXECUTION 117 based ALVINN system cannot accept direct requests for a lateral position, its implicit pure-pursuit steering model <ref> [114] </ref> provides a convenient interface for this purpose. By laterally moving the pure-pursuit point in the desired direction over time, the vehicle can be instructed to change lanes. RALPH uses a template-based approach with an explicit model of road geometry. In this case, PolySAPIENT's lateral preferences can be explicitly stated. <p> When the vehicle is correctly centered in the lane, this object votes positively for all actions that maintain the current lateral position. When the vehicle moves out of its lane (during lane changing), the vehicle reasoning object monitors the motion of the lane-tracker's pure-pursuit point <ref> [114, 73] </ref> and votes positively for actions that continue moving the pure-pursuit point towards the new lane. Once the pure-pursuit point is close to the new lane, the lane reasoning object changes its local state to lane-keeping.

However, in the context of tactical-level reasoning, risk homeostasis theory provides support for utility-based approaches to situation awareness (See Chapter 5). 2.1.3 Perceptual and Motivational Models Perception models have been used to describe driver behavior in accidents [109], suggest methods for safer driving <ref> [117, 118] </ref> and motivate new collision warning devices [8]. In the tactical driving domain, perceptual models are particularly relevant in two areas: sensor modeling and driver intentions. Sensor modeling at the operational level is primarily concerned with tracking objects and segmentation (low-level actions which humans typically take for granted). <p> At the tactical level, the focus shifts to reasoning about object-to-lane mapping, blind spots and occlusions tasks which human drivers perform more consciously. Unsurprisingly, novice drivers are less adept at these higher-level tasks: for example, inexperienced drivers are likely to forget about vehicles which are not currently visible <ref> [118] </ref>. Perceptual models also lead to heuristics for safer driving which can be exploited by both humans and intelligent vehicles (e.g., At night, don't over-drive the range of your headlights). The perceptual motivation for positional maneuvering is further discussed in Section 2.2.3. 2.1. <p> TACTICAL SA 27 2.2.3 Positional maneuvering Drivers, unlike fighter pilots, are typically not interested in maneuvering to gain an offensive advantage over other vehicles as a prelude to combat. However, according to defensive driving theory <ref> [118, 68] </ref>, certain configurations of vehicles in traffic are inherently risky while others are relatively safe. This is due to several factors: perceptual limitations; incomplete knowledge of driver intentions; and availability of escape routes. <p> In defensive driving literature, knowledge is often expressed in the form of high-level rules <ref> [117, 66, 118, 92, 68] </ref>. For example: Before lane changing, look for traffic approaching from the rear in the new lane. Also, check cars that are about to enter the new lane from the far lanes [66].

Reference-contexts: Confucius The fact that humans learn to drive, and improve with experience suggests that an intelligent vehicle could acquire situation awareness through repeated exposure to traffic situations. Although machine learning has been successfully applied to operational-level tasks, such as lane-tracking [73, 74] and trailer-truck docking <ref> [119] </ref>, very few systems have applied learning to tactical-level driving. 129 130 CHAPTER 6. LEARNING SITUATION AWARENESS 6.1 Applying Learning to Tactical Driving Learning strategies can be broadly classified into two types: supervised and unsupervised. In the former, the system relies on a teaching signal provided by an external source. <p> LEARNING SITUATION AWARENESS 6.1 Applying Learning to Tactical Driving Learning strategies can be broadly classified into two types: supervised and unsupervised. In the former, the system relies on a teaching signal provided by an external source. Examples include backprop neural networks <ref> [93, 119] </ref> which are given input and output mappings for the examples in a training set, and genetic algorithms [39] which are given feedback through a user-supplied evaluation function. By contrast, unsupervised techniques discover inherent patterns in data without outside help.

Reference-contexts: A representative example of a risk model is Wilde's Risk Homeostasis Theory: Risk Homeostasis Theory maintains that, in any activity, people accept a certain level of subjectively estimated risk to their health, safety, and other things they value, in exchange for the benefits they hope to receive from that activity <ref> [120] </ref>. <p> that humans adjust their behavior so as to maintain (rather than minimize) their per ceived risk at a constant set-point risk level: The degree of risk-taking behavior and the magnitude of loss . . . are maintained over time, unless there is a change in the target level of risk <ref> [120] </ref>. 2.1. DRIVER MODELS 19 A case study, known as the Munich Taxicab Experiment [7] was conducted to test the implications of risk homeostasis theory under controlled conditions. <p> Some vehicles in a taxi fleet were equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS) that allowed drivers to maintain steering control during hard braking on slippery roads. Conventional wisdom predicted that the ABS-equipped vehicles would be safer than unequipped vehicles. Surprisingly, the results showed that: <ref> [7, 120] </ref>: * Among the accidents involving the company's taxis, there was no statistically significant difference between the involvement rate of the two vehicle types (in fact, the ABS vehicles were involved in slightly more accidents). * Accident severity was independent of the presence or absence of ABS in the taxi.

Reference-contexts: Note that this method is not equivalent to adding independent Gaussian noise to both x and y in SHIVA, as in a real range sensor, the errors in x and y are correlated. Cognition modules which use these sensors typically use a Kalman filter <ref> [121, 96] </ref> to update perception estimates. Thus, the position of a sensed vehicle is represented not as a single point, but rather as an uncertainty ellipse.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, the scenario control tools allow repeatable testing of different reasoning systems on a consistent set of traffic situations. 29 30 CHAPTER 3. THE SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT 3.1 Related Work While traffic simulators have been in use for over thirty years <ref> [17, 20, 37, 122] </ref>, no existing tool has all the capabilities desirable for designing intelligent vehicle algorithms. Simulators are generally created to study traffic patterns and consequently fail to provide adequate facilities for adding or debugging new vehicle control algorithms. Few simulators are available for tactical-level research 1 . <p> Human factors studies have also demonstrated that the pure-pursuit model approximates the human steering response [82]. Although lane tracking is a challenging robotics problem [23, 54, 73], most highway simulations <ref> [122, 69] </ref> still equate lane tracking and lane occupancy. Such simulations model lane changes as instantaneous actions, allowing their cognition modules to completely ignore the difficult decisions needed during lane changing and fail to capture behaviors such as lane straddling and aborted lane changes.

Reference-contexts: PLANNING 85 laterally from the origin to the target lane. This causes the operational-level controller to steer the vehicle smoothly into the next lane. target gap 6 , and initiate a lane change. The operational-level control for lane changing has been studied in depth <ref> [77, 123, 47] </ref>, and is not discussed further in this thesis. Unlike most tactical-level reasoning systems, which assume that the commanded lane change always succeeds, MonoSAPIENT actively monitors the progress of the maneuver to determine whether the lane change should be aborted.

Reference-contexts: Other control models have been developed in the traffic simulation domain. The ones of most interest to tactical driving research are those which model lane-changing [116, 2], car following <ref> [124] </ref>, and emergency maneuvers [3]. Since these models are computational, they can be directly incorporated into tactical reasoning system, as described in Chapters 4 and 5. 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Since the arbitration is not localized (unlike PolySAPIENT's single voting arbiter), this modification process is nontrivial. The potential field techniques [58, 53], fuzzy control <ref> [49, 126] </ref>, and schemabased methods [6] use a different approach to command fusion: the arbiter does not select between the outputs of different modules, but rather combines them.
