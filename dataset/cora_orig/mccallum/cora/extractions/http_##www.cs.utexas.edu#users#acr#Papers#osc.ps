Abstract: All-optical networks using wavelength division multiplexing are increasingly coming to be regarded as the technology of choice for the next generation of wide-area backbone networks. These networks incorporate optical switches that employ the concept of Latin Routers [BH93] for assigning wavelengths to routes. The issue of maximizing wavelength utilization at these switching devices is of great importance since it leads to significant improvements in overall network performance [CB95]. In this paper, we present two fast approximation algorithms GREEDY and MATCH for the problem of maximizing wavelength utilization at Latin Routers. These are the first known polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the problem of maximizing the number of entries that can be added to a partially filled Latin Square that achieve non-trivial worst-case performance guarantees. These algorithms are easily implementable and have very small constants in their running times making them eminently suitable for actual use in real-world optical switches. We also provide strong experimental evidence to show that, in practice, these algorithms are near-optimal.

Reference-contexts: WDM optical networks utilize the large bandwidth available in optical fibers by partitioning it into several channels each at a different optical wavelength <ref> [BH92, CNW90, IEE93, IK92] </ref>. The typical optical network consists of routing nodes interconnected by point-to-point fiber-optic links. Each link supports a certain number of wavelengths. The routing nodes are capable of photonic switching, also known as dynamic wavelength routing, which involves the setting up of lightpaths [CB95, CGK92, ZA94].

Reference-contexts: These restrictions constrain the simple matrix model of the switch. What we get is in fact a Latin Square (LS). Latin Squares were first used to model optical switches in <ref> [BH93] </ref> (Latin Routers). More formal details are given in Section 2. Though the number of wavelengths at a given node is limited by the technology (tunability of lasers, amplifier bandwidth, etc.), nevertheless, it is possible to build a transparent wide-area optical network by spatial reuse of wavelengths. <p> of GREEDY; Section 2.4 is a description of MATCH; Section 3 contains the experimental results showing that MATCH and GREEDY are fast and near-optimal in practice. 2 Algorithms for Switch Configuration 2.1 The Problem As stated before, the problem of achieving conflict-free wavelength routing is modeled by utilizing Latin Routers <ref> [BH93] </ref>. These are routing devices that employ the concept of a Latin Square (LS). Before actually stating the problem we develop some basic concepts and terminology.

Reference-contexts: The typical optical network consists of routing nodes interconnected by point-to-point fiber-optic links. Each link supports a certain number of wavelengths. The routing nodes are capable of photonic switching, also known as dynamic wavelength routing, which involves the setting up of lightpaths <ref> [CB95, CGK92, ZA94] </ref>. A lightpath is an optical path between two nodes on a specific wavelength. The optical switch at a node assigns the wavelengths from an incoming port to an outgoing port. Figure 1 shows an optical switch S. <p> Secondly, each entry of the matrix must have at most one non-zero value. This is a compromise between hardware complexity and performance because switches that permit routing of multiple wavelengths between the same input and output ports require additional hardware that is both complex and costly <ref> [CB95] </ref>. The third constraint is that of achieving conflict-free wavelength routing the wavelengths assigned to messages at an input port are all distinct and there must be no wavelength conflict at any of the output ports. These restrictions constrain the simple matrix model of the switch. <p> Various policies for wavelength routing, and the corresponding assignments of wavelengths along the routes, have been reported in the literature [CGK92, LL93, RS94, ZA94]. These policies aim at minimizing congestion, average hop-distance, call blocking probability or maximizing traffic throughput, and clear channel density. Chen and Banerjee <ref> [CB95] </ref> realized that these policies often lead to scenarios where a significant number of wavelengths, available at the input and output ports of the routers, cannot be used due to potential wavelength conflict. They focus on maximizing the wavelength utilization at a Latin Router in static wavelength routing. <p> These algorithms are easily implementable and have very small constants in their running times thus making them eminently suitable for actual use in real-world optical switches. We also provide strong experimental evidence to show that, in practice, these algorithms are, in fact, near-optimal. Unlike Algorithm 2 of <ref> [CB95] </ref>, neither of these algorithms changes preassigned entries. GREEDY possesses the extra advantage of being usable in a dynamic situation where routing requests are online. <p> In addition, we present BRANCHBOUND a back-tracking algorithm that finds an optimal solution to the problem of maximizing the number of entries that can be added to a partially filled Latin Square. BRANCHBOUND is a more efficient version of Algorithm 1 of <ref> [CB95] </ref>, that dynamically prunes the search space to save time. The efficacy of this pruning is demonstrated by the fact that we are able to obtain performance results for large Latin Routers in our simulations. <p> The second algorithm, GREEDY, is a 3-approximation algorithm. The third algorithm, MATCH, is a 2-approximation algorithm. 2.2 Branch and Bound Algorithm The algorithm in <ref> [CB95] </ref> is the natural backtracking algorithm. It tries to improve the running time by exhaustively trying the empty entries in the increasing order of their degrees of freedom. We give a better backtracking algorithm below. <p> Degree of Freedom. To reduce the number of backtracking steps the degree of freedom concept is used in a fashion identical to that of Algorithm 1 of <ref> [CB95] </ref>. The order of 0 entries tried for backtracking is based on the degree of freedom of the entries. Dynamic Pruning. At any point the algorithm maintains the best solution found so far.

Reference-contexts: The computational complexity of finding a maximum-density extension of a given PLS was unresolved for a long time. Colbourn, finally, proved that the problem of determining whether a given PLS is completable is NP-complete <ref> [Col84] </ref>. Therefore, the natural goal is to find a fast (polynomial time) algorithm that given a PLS, extends it to an LS of as large a density as possible. We formally define the notion of an approximation algorithm. Definition 6 Let L be any PLS.

For each color, we can build a n 2 node bipar tite graph and run the maximum matching algorithm MAXIMUM MATCHING of Hopcroft-Karp <ref> [HK73] </ref>, which runs in O (n 2:5 ) time. Thus, the total algorithm can be implemented in O (n 3:5 ) time. Additional Heuristic. We also provide an additional heuristic (without analysis) which seems to improve the algorithm a little. This is also motivated by the degree of freedom parameter.
