Reference-contexts: Although work on knowledge compilation (c.f. (del Val 1995; Marquis 1995)) has a similar flavor of adding clauses to theories for obtaining completeness, there has been no attempt yet to obtain anytime families. Relevance Logic and RP-Entailment: Based on the earlier work of Belnap <ref> (Belnap 1977) </ref> on relevance logic and Levesque (Levesque 1984) on a a logic of implicit and explicit beliefs, Frisch (Frisch 1987) presented a 3-valued model-theory for PC, whose entailment relation j= RP is the strongest propositional consequence relation that is sound but allows no chaining.

Reference-contexts: Although anytime families of reasoners were previously-known for clausal theories (c.f. (Cadoli & Schaerf 1992)), we do not know of any other general technique for constructing anytime family of reasoners for clausal as well as non-clausal theories. Anytime reasoners <ref> (Boddy & Dean 1988) </ref> are complete reasoners that provide partial answers even if they are stopped prematurely; the completeness of the answer improves with the time used in computing the answer. They could also be used for providing a quick "first cut" to a problem, which can be later improved.

Reference-contexts: This family of reasoners constitute an anytime reasoner, since each propositional theory has a complete reasoner in the family. Although anytime families of reasoners were previously-known for clausal theories (c.f. <ref> (Cadoli & Schaerf 1992) </ref>), we do not know of any other general technique for constructing anytime family of reasoners for clausal as well as non-clausal theories. <p> Since fP; :P _ Qg 6j= RP Q and fP; :P _ Qg ` BCP Q, it then follows that ` BCP is strictly stronger than j= B . Recall that ` BCP can be determined in only O (jj+ j j) time. Approximate Entailment: Cadoli and Schaerf <ref> (Cadoli & Schaerf 1992) </ref> parameterized j= RP by sets of propositions: their entailment relation j= 3 S is defined using a 3-valued model theory which restricts each atom in the set S to the traditional 2 values. 4 In--tuitively, the logic allows chaining on the atoms in the set S; for <p> The term "vivid" is inspired by (Levesque 1986), where vivid theories are ones where an answer can be "read off" quickly. 4 <ref> (Cadoli & Schaerf 1992) </ref> also defines a family of unsound but complete entailment relations, using a similar idea.

Reference-contexts: inferable from a clausal theory using = BCP , denoted by ` BCP , iff [ f: g = BCP ff g. (Dalal 1995) shows that ` BCP is the well-known linear-time incomplete propositional reasoner called clausal boolean constraint propagation (BCP) (McAllester 1990), which is a variant of unit resolution <ref> (Chang & Lee 1973) </ref>. ` BCP is known to be complete for inferring clauses from theories containing only Horn clauses. By proving that the equivalence relation = BCP is admissible, we obtain a new anytime family of reasoners for clausal theories.

Reference-contexts: It is trivial to verify that 0 ` BCP S in the above example. Theorem 2 shows that ` R is sound and complete for inferring clauses from theories. The completeness claim essentially means that ` R is Socratic-complete (see <ref> (Crawford & Kuipers 1991) </ref>) for inferring clauses. Theorem 2 For any admissible relation R, any theory , and any clause : j= iff ` R . The consequence relation ` R can be restricted to obtain consequence relations that are more complete than ` R , but are still tractable. <p> Thus, the two families of entailments are incomparable. Access-Limited Logics (ALL): Crawford and Kuipers <ref> (Crawford & Kuipers 1991) </ref> presented ALL, a logic that attempts to formalize the access limitations that are inherent in a network-structured knowledge base. ALL allows retrieving only those assertions that are reachable by following an available access path.

Reference-contexts: They define a family ` k ALL of entailment relation such that only k nesting of preliminary queries are allowed for inference in ` k ALL . Although the exact relation between ` BCP k ALL is still open, an example by <ref> (Crawford 1994) </ref> (given in (Dalal 1995)) shows that ` 2 ALL is not stronger than ` BCP 2 . Conclusions We presented a technique for developing anytime families of reasoners based on admissible equivalence relations on propositional theories and formulas.

Reference-contexts: IRI-94-10117 and ARPA/ARL Contract No. DAAL01-94-K-0119. 1 For the purposes of this paper, a problem is tractable iff the corresponding decision problem is known to be in PTIME. <ref> (Dalal 1995) </ref>). Since not all equivalence relations on theories and formulas provide reasoners suitable for tractable reasoning with logical knowledge bases, we restrict our attention to admissible relations, which satisfy the properties listed in Section . <p> A clause is inferable from a clausal theory using = BCP , denoted by ` BCP , iff [ f: g = BCP ff g. <ref> (Dalal 1995) </ref> shows that ` BCP is the well-known linear-time incomplete propositional reasoner called clausal boolean constraint propagation (BCP) (McAllester 1990), which is a variant of unit resolution (Chang & Lee 1973). ` BCP is known to be complete for inferring clauses from theories containing only Horn clauses. <p> Although we restrict our attention to the clausal case for all the examples in this paper, the technique for building anytime families of reasoners is also applicable to non-clausal theories. The details and the proofs are provided in <ref> (Dalal 1995) </ref>, available online through the author's home page on the world-wide-web. Preliminaries We consider formulas that are in negation normal form, i.e., finitely built from the literals (propositional atoms and their complements) using only two other connectives, ^ (conjunction) and _ (disjunction). <p> They define a family ` k ALL of entailment relation such that only k nesting of preliminary queries are allowed for inference in ` k ALL . Although the exact relation between ` BCP k ALL is still open, an example by (Crawford 1994) (given in <ref> (Dalal 1995) </ref>) shows that ` 2 ALL is not stronger than ` BCP 2 . Conclusions We presented a technique for developing anytime families of reasoners based on admissible equivalence relations on propositional theories and formulas. <p> We compared the anytime family ` BCP 0 ; ` BCP 1 ; : : : based on BCP with several other anytime families presented in the literature. Although the other families are re stricted to clausal theories, our technique also work for non-clausal theories. In <ref> (Dalal 1995) </ref>, we extend BCP to non-clausal theories and use the above technique to develop an anytime family ` FP 0 ; ` FP 1 ; : : : for arbitrary propositional theories.

Reference-contexts: Given any reasoning task, one starts with ` 0 , and successively proceeds to the next reasoner if more time is available. We will specify reasoners using algebraic semantics (c.f. <ref> (Dionne, Mays, & Oles 1993) </ref>), i.e., by a set of equalities between formulas and between theories, which generates an equivalence relation on the set of theories and formulas. A theory is inconsistent iff it is equivalent to the theory ff g, where the formula f denotes false.

Reference-contexts: Relevance Logic and RP-Entailment: Based on the earlier work of Belnap (Belnap 1977) on relevance logic and Levesque (Levesque 1984) on a a logic of implicit and explicit beliefs, Frisch <ref> (Frisch 1987) </ref> presented a 3-valued model-theory for PC, whose entailment relation j= RP is the strongest propositional consequence relation that is sound but allows no chaining. For clausal theories, he proved that j= RP can be determined in O (jj j j) time. <p> However, it blocks chaining; for example, fP; :P _ Qg 6j= RP Q. Since j= RP iff is a tautology iff : is unsatisfiable <ref> (Frisch 1987) </ref>, it follows that j= RP is intractable. If we restrict our attention to clausal theories and formulas for which j= RP are tractable, it turns out that ` BCP , which is identical to ` BCP 0 , is at least as strong as j= RP .

Reference-contexts: This fixpoint characterization is then used to define a transformation of arbitrary propositional theories into logically equivalent theories for which the base reasoner is complete; such theories are said "vivid". The term "vivid" is inspired by <ref> (Levesque 1986) </ref>, where vivid theories are ones where an answer can be "read off" quickly. 4 (Cadoli & Schaerf 1992) also defines a family of unsound but complete entailment relations, using a similar idea.

The Herbrand base, HB (), of any theory , is the set of atoms appearing in . Admissible Equivalences We present several properties of equivalence relations on propositional theories and formulas that make them specially suitable for reasoning with logical knowledge bases.
