Abstract: 1. [10 fi 6 = 60 points] The shuffle-exchange network SE k on p = 2 k nodes has the following topology. Each node has two outgoing physical channels, a shuffle channel and an exchange channel. For 0 6 i &lt; p, the shuffle channel from node i (labeled c 0i ) goes to node j, where the binary representation of j is the left rotation of the binary representation of i. The exchange channel from node i (labeled c 1i ) goes to node k, where the binary representations of k and i differ in the least significant bit.
