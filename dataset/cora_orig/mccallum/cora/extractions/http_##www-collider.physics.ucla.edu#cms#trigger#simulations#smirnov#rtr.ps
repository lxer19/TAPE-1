Reference-contexts: Only principal features of the design are mentioned here. Detailed description of the LCT electronics may be found elsewhere <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The algorithm of this electronics is implemented in a computer program. This simulating program is fed by the experimental data measured during summer 1996 CSC prototype test. This prototype is denoted P0 and thoroughly described and studied in [3].

This prototype is denoted P0 and thoroughly described and studied in <ref> [3] </ref>. According to [4, 5] and the P0 data, the fraction of events with additional tracks from electromagnetic secondaries may be sufficient. It is not clear how often the LCT card will fail to identify a muon track surrounded by secondaries or mistakes a secondary track instead of muon one.

Reference-contexts: Identification of multi-track and empty events is done by a software program conducting completed logical analysis (see appendix). A pattern shape table and a look-up table were generated by authors of <ref> [6] </ref> using assumption of perfect patterns with the uniform angle distribution. For the perfect patterns the possibility for the electronics to find a signal in a wrong half-strip is neglected. The signal can be only exactly in that half-strip which was crossed by the track. <p> Simulation of LCT cards, starting with simulation of the comparator network. Threshold for central signal is 5 fC for this work. Nominal shift of the layers is compensated by shift of output of half-strip comparators. The patterns and look-up tables were calculated in <ref> [6] </ref>. They are so-called perfect patterns, for which only that half-strip may be active, via which the particle really passed. (The name means the patterns for a perfect chamber. They are not perfectly suited for the real chamber with its finite resolution, shifts and background.) Misalignment was not accounted.

Reference-contexts: Read next event, subtract the ADC pedestals, calibrate the ADC and correct the cross-talks. This is done by the subroutines from 'P0 Analysis Software' package (http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/muons.html), the method is described in <ref> [7] </ref>. 4. Select clusters according to the following conditions: given strip is more charged than left and right neighbor and the total charge of these three strips is more than a threshold, 10 fC. 5. Reconstruct the tracks by the tracking algorithm, described in the appendix.
