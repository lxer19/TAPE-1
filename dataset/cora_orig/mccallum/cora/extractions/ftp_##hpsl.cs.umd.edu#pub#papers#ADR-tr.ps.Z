Abstract: As computational power and storage capacity increase, processing and analyzing large volumes of multi-dimensional datasets play an increasingly important part in many domains of scientific research. Several database research groups and vendors have developed object-relational database systems to provide some support for managing and/or visualizing multi-dimensional datasets. These systems, however, provide little or no support for analyzing or processing these datasets the assumption is that this is too application-specific to warrant common support. As a result, applications that process these datasets are usually decoupled from data storage and management, resulting in inefficiency due to copying and loss of locality. Furthermore, every application developer has to implement complex support for managing and scheduling the processing. Our study of a large set of scientific applications over the past three years indicates that the processing for such datasets is often highly stylized and shares several important characteristics. Usually, both the input dataset as well as the result being computed have underlying multi-dimensional grids. The basic processing step usually consists of transforming individual input items, mapping the transformed items to the output grid and computing output items by aggregating, in some way, all the transformed input items mapped to the corresponding grid point. In this paper, we present the design of T2, a customizable parallel database that integrates storage, retrieval and processing of multi-dimensional datasets. T2 provides support for common operations including index generation, data retrieval, memory management, scheduling of processing across a parallel machine and user interaction. It achieves its primary advantage from the ability to seamlessly integrate data retrieval and processing for a wide variety of applications and from the ability to maintain and jointly process multiple datasets with different underlying grids.

Reference-contexts: As for mapping functions, T2 currently supports static linking; we plan to provide dynamic linking in the near future. By default, T2 uses the minimax algorithm [26, 27] for declustering and the Short Spanning Path (SSP) algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> for clustering. In addition, T2 allows the data layout to be separately computed and provided in a file. This would be useful if the algorithms used to compute the placements were embedded in some other application that could not be structured to fit T2's interface requirements.

Reference-contexts: Aggregation functions are assumed to be commutative and associative and can be applied to individual data items in parallel and in any order. T2 is able to deal with both distributive and algebraic aggregation functions as defined by Gray et. al <ref> [15] </ref>. Currently, aggregation functions are statically linked. We plan to provide dynamic linking facilities in the near future. Functions are specified by a (function name, object file name) pair.

Reference-contexts: These datasets are usually multi-dimensional. The data dimensions can be spatial coordinates, time, or varying experimental conditions such as temperature, velocity or magnetic field. The increasing importance of such datasets has been recognized by several database research groups and several systems have been developed for managing and/or visualizing them <ref> [2, 7, 17, 22, 32, 38] </ref>. In addition, commercial object-relational database systems provide some support for managing multidimensional datasets (e.g., the SpatialWare DataBlade Module [36] for the Informix Universal Server and the Oracle 8 Spatial data cartridge [31]).

These datasets are usually multi-dimensional.

Reference-contexts: A variety of projections are used by earth scientists the USGS cartographic transformation package supports 24 different projections <ref> [40] </ref> . An earth scientist specifies the projection that best suits her needs, maps the sensor data using the chosen projection, and generates an image by compositing the projected data.

Reference-contexts: At the basic level, it can emulate the usual behavior of a physical microscope including continuously moving the stage and changing magnification and focus. Used in this manner, the Virtual Microscope can support completely 3 digital dynamic telepathology <ref> [30, 41, 42] </ref>. In addition, it enables new modes of behavior that cannot be achieved with a physical microscope, such as simultaneous viewing and manipulation of a single slide by multiple users. Pathologists and biomedical researchers need to process as well as view microscopy data.
