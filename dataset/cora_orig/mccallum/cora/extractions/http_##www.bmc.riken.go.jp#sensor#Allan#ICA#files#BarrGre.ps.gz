Abstract: Recently, many works were carried out concerning blind source separation (BSS) that use the principle of independent component analysis (ICA), which stands as an elegant, simple and powerful tool to BSS. However, the algorithms proposed until now are still sensitive to non-stationarity, which alters in a bad sense the separation. We propose here a simple pre-processing to the mixed signals based on low-pass filtering that ensures a much better performance for the ICA algorithms.

Reference-contexts: These classical techniques are usually phase-blind, which means that after processing a given signal, the phase information about the signal is lost. One of the proposed solutions to deal with non-Gaussian signals is independent component analysis (ICA), initiated by the seminal work of Jutten and Herault <ref> [8] </ref>. The purpose of ICA is to design a system that, with the mixed signals at the input, finds output signals as independent as possible. In this field, many works were carried out.

Reference-contexts: B. Normalisation During learning, as discussed above, matrix C is undefined up to permutation and scaling. We cannot do much about the permutation, but we can still normalise the weights so that they are not essentially altered. Parra <ref> [10] </ref> suggested the following normalisation ^ b i;j = b i;j s X ~ b 2 ; (7) where ~ b i;j are elements of B 1 .
