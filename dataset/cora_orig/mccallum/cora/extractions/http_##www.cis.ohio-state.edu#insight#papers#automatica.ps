Title: Adaptive Simulation and Control of Variable Structure Control Systems in Sliding Regimes  
Author: Feng Zhao Vadim I. Utkin 
Note: To appear in Automatica 1  
Abstract: Conventional simulation and control methods for sliding mode control systems are limited by the available sampling bandwidth and allowable tracking error. Consequently, these methods suffer from harmful chattering. This paper presents an adaptive method for the discrete-time simulation and control of sliding mode control systems, based on an analysis on the relationship between tracking error and sampling rate for these systems. Our analysis shows that the tracking error decreases as the sampling time interval decreases when the sliding condition exists. The adaptive method exploits the concept of discrete-time sliding mode; the method adjusts its sampling rate to ensure that the tracking error is bounded within a boundary layer of the sliding surface. To simulate a sliding mode system in discrete time, we present an adaptive integration scheme that follows the ideal system within a given tolerance. Likewise, the adaptive method can be used to generate discrete control signals for sliding mode systems. Simulation results on examples have shown that the adaptive method is free of chattering. Key words | Variable structure control; computer simulation; adaptive methods; sliding modes; chattering-free tracking; robust control.

Reference-contexts: The system operating in this fashion is said to be in the discrete-time sliding mode (Utkin 1993). A conventional chattering reduction method approximates a switching control law within a boundary layer of a sliding surface with a continuous control interpolated between two extreme control values <ref> (Slotine and Li 1991) </ref>. The sampling rate in a discrete-time implementation of such a method is fixed and has to be high enough to reduce chattering as the control remains constant within each sampling interval.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the errors are accumulated in following the slow component. The Runge-Kutta integration method reacts less sensitively to discontinuities in the right-hand side of differential equations than multi-step or extrapolation methods <ref> (Stoer and Bulirsch 1993) </ref>. Consequently, the Runge-Kutta method is commonly used for integrating discontinuous systems. However, sliding mode systems are switching between two vector fields at an infinite rate; this forces the fixed step-size Runge-Kutta integrator to limit its step-size.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many man-made electro-mechanical systems operate in discontinuous regimes. A controlled system can operate in a sliding mode in which the system switches infinitely fast between two control signals and evolves on a manifold known as the sliding surface <ref> (Utkin 1992) </ref>. Simulation and control of continuous systems can be tackled with modern analytical analysis or computational simulation. However, discontinuous systems such as the sliding mode systems pose sever challenges to simulation and control design: 1. Chattering is common in practice.
