Reference-contexts: The DARPA packet radio and SURAN programs [sur90, pr-89] demonstrated the 136 basic capabilities of ad-hoc networking. However, the ad-hoc networks proposed and implemented to date <ref> [LNT87, ABB + 96] </ref> have been designed as opaque subnetworks using an intranet protocol for packet forwarding that enables packets to flow from one packet radio to the other and from one entry point of the ad-hoc network to an exit point.

Reference-contexts: In an ad-hoc network, this medium or channel is a scarce resource, and as such, designing MAC protocols that are efficient even when hidden terminals are present is a fundamental problem in ad-hoc networks. The first MAC protocol for packet-radio was ALOHA <ref> [Abr70] </ref>. In this protocol, radios did not sense or "listen" to the channel prior to transmitting. As such, the vulnerability period (the period of time during which a packet may be interfered with at its 3 intended destination) is twice the size of the packet transmission time. <p> MACA does not use carrier sensing before 28 transmitting an RTS, and a station can start transmitting an RTS (or CTS) even while another RTS has reached the station but has not been received in its entirety (this is similar to the operation of ALOHA <ref> [Abr70] </ref>). However, a station that understands a clear RTS from another station defers its own transmission for the duration of the balance of a successful transmission period. Following this deferment, there is a random waiting period before transmission begins again.

Reference-contexts: The multiple access collision avoidance (MACA) protocol [Kar90] and its modified version MACAW (MACA for Wireless) <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref> were proposed to operate with hidden terminal using a simple three-way dialogue without using carrier sensing at the transmitter. <p> We show that the MACA protocol and its derivatives (e.g., MACAW <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>) become a variant of FAMA protocols when RTS and CTS transmissions last long enough. <p> We show that the MACA protocol and its derivatives (e.g., MACAW [BDSZ94]) become a variant of FAMA protocols when RTS and CTS transmissions last long enough. We also show that, contrary to what some previous approaches have suggested <ref> [BDSZ94, Kar90] </ref>, contention avoidance should be done at both sender and receiver, and that combining carrier sensing and the RTS-CTS exchange provides a very efficient MAC protocol that performs as well as MACA under the hidden-terminal situation, and as well as CSMA otherwise. 8 Section 2.1 introduces two variants of FAMA <p> Figure 2.1 specifies MACA in detail, following from Karn's original description [Kar90]. MACA and improvements over it are also discussed in detail by Bharghavan, et al. <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>. The key aspect of this variant of FAMA protocols that is important to highlight is that, as specified 11 by Bharghavan, et al. [BDSZ94] and Karn [Kar90], stations do not sense the channel before transmissions. <p> MACA and improvements over it are also discussed in detail by Bharghavan, et al. <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>. The key aspect of this variant of FAMA protocols that is important to highlight is that, as specified 11 by Bharghavan, et al. [BDSZ94] and Karn [Kar90], stations do not sense the channel before transmissions. A station defers its transmission only after it has received and understood a complete RTS or CTS (just as the ALOHA protocol permits a station to send a data packet whenever it is ready). <p> The next access to the channel is driven by the arrival of new packets to the network and retransmission of packets that have been backed off. Different backoff strategies can be adopted in the versions of FAMA addressed in this chapter (e.g., see the one proposed for MACAW <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>). Exact distributions of the retransmission times are not necessary in our throughput analysis, which simply assumes 14 that retransmissions are, on the average, long enough to make them independent of the original arrival of packets for transmission. <p> Therefore, I = t 1 = (1 e t ) Substituting Eqs. (2.14), (2.15) and (2.16) into Eq. (2.1) we obtain Eq. (2.10). 2 2.3.4 MACA fl &gt; 2t . Note that, because a station using MACA does not enforce any waiting times after transmission periods (see <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref> and Figures 2.2, 2.4 and 2.7), the RTS and CTS specify how long stations should defer [Kar90]. <p> In practice, the effect of a small b can be obtained by allowing a station to transmit multiple packets per floor acquisition. Our results on MACA throughput are in agreement with the empirical simulation results presented by Bharghavan, et al. <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref> for single-hop networks. In FAMA-NTR, slotting adds little performance improvement over the basic protocol. This should be expected, as slotting adds little benefit in non-persistent CSMA [KT75]. An interesting result, however, is that even with slotting, MACA does not match FAMA-NTR's performance. <p> This protocol, however, was designed for LANs in which stations can sense the channel while transmitting. A number of techniques have been proposed by Bharghavan, et al. <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref> to improve the performance of MACA [Kar90], which constitutes a variant of FAMA using RTS-CTS exchange and no carrier sensing. These techniques consist of different retrans 42 mission strategies and additional handshaking between sender and receiver. The resulting protocol is called MACAW. <p> There are different schemes with which the channel floor can be acquired. A number of protocols, including MACA and IEEE 802.11 <ref> [Col83, Kar90, BDSZ94, SAO90] </ref> use a three or four-way handshake between sender and receiver to avoid collisions. <p> This three or four-way handshake amounts to collision detection by the receiver and addresses, at least to some degree, two main problems: (a) the half-duplex nature of single-channel wireless networks, and (b) the hidden-terminal effect <ref> [TK75, BDSZ94] </ref>, which inhibits the transmitter's ability to detect that its intended receiver is receiving multiple transmissions. <p> Figure 3.1 specifies FAMA-PJ. The backoff times used in FAMA-PJ are obtained using a uniformly distributed random variable distributed over the values from zero to ten times the duration of an RTS transmission. Other backoff strategies can also be used (e.g., see <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>). 3.2 Floor Assignment in FAMA-PJ The size of the RTS packets in relation to the data packets is critical to the efficient operation of the protocol. <p> Since the time SRMA was first proposed, several other medium access control (MAC) protocols have been proposed for either single-channel wireless networks or wireline local area networks that are based on similar RTS-CTS exchanges, or based on RTSs followed by pauses <ref> [BDSZ94, Vad95, Col83, LM84, Rom86, SAO90] </ref>. Karn [Kar90] proposed a protocol called MACA (multiple access collision avoidance) to address the problems of hidden terminals in single-channel networks. <p> Section 4.1 describes FAMA-NCS and a variant of FAMA based on packet sensing (i.e., the transmission of RTSs without carrier sensing), which amounts to MACA or SRMA using ALOHA. Although the original motivation for such protocols as MACA, IEEE 802.11 DFW-MAC, MACAW <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>, and BAPU [Vad95] was to solve the hidden-terminal problems of CSMA by using RTS-CTS handshakes, it is easy to show by example that simply introducing three-way handshakes (RTS-CTS-data) or even more complex handshakes (RTS-CTS-data-ACK or others) does not suffice to eliminate all instances in which two or more senders are <p> We also specify FAMA-NCS as using a uniform distribution when choosing backoff times; however, other backoff strategies can be adopted (e.g., see those proposed for MACAW <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>). <p> Following the deferment specified by the RTS, a station 85 with a packet to send waits a random waiting period before it transmits an RTS. MACA and improvements over it are also discussed in detail by Bharghavan, et al. <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>. 4.2 Correct Floor Acquisition 4.2.1 Using Carrier Sensing For FAMA-NCS to provide correct floor acquisition, it must ensure that that each new packet, or any of its retransmissions, is sent to the channel within a finite time after it becomes ready for transmission, and that a data packet does not <p> Figure 4.13 shows the various topologies used by these simulation experiments.

To illustrate the importance of carrier sensing, we chose to compare FAMA-NCS against MACAW instead of FAMA-NPS, , because MACAW uses packet-sensing and RTS-CTS handshakes and its performance has been reported before by Bharghavan, et al. [BDSZ94]. <p> C++ Protocol Toolkit (CPT) simulator. 113 environments FAMA-NCS as compared to MACAW 4 <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>.

In configuration (a) of Fig. 4.13 all stations are within range of all others (no hidden terminals). Traffic was generated at each node (N1 - N6) directed to the base station. <p> Additionally, fairness is not an issue in FAMA-NCS. Even the simple uniformly distributed backoff scheme gives all stations basically an equal share of the channel without the complex housekeeping suggested in MACAW <ref> [BDSZ94] </ref>. 116 As expected, FAMA-NCS with packet trains of up to five packets in a train improves over single-packet transmissions by about 14% in the fully connected network and 17% for the two-base station configuration. <p> This protocol, however, was designed for LANs in which stations can sense the channel while transmitting.

The resulting protocol is called MACAW. <p> Contrary to the conjectures made in prior work on MAC protocols based on collision avoidance <ref> [BDSZ94, Kar90] </ref>, our verification and throughput analysis demonstrates that carrier sensing should be used in single channel networks because it substantially improves performance by enabling floor acquisition in the presence of hidden terminals.
