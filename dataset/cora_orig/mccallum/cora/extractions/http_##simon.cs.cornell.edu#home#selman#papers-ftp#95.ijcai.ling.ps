Abstract: We develop a methodology for comparing knowledge representation formalisms in terms of their "representational succinctness," that is, their ability to express knowledge situations relatively efficiently. We use this framework for comparing many important formalisms for knowledge base representation: propositional logic, default logic, circumscription, and model preference defaults; and, at a lower level, Horn formulas, characteristic models, decision trees, disjunctive normal form, and conjunctive normal form. We also show that adding new variables improves the effective expressibility of certain knowledge representation formalisms.

Reference-contexts: By H we denote the class of all formulas in conjunctive normal form such that each clause has at most one unnegated literal. The formalism is very popular because there is a fast algorithm for satisfiability checking of Horn formulas (see <ref> [ Dowling and Gallier, 1984 ] </ref> ) and because of its connection to logic programming. Un- fortunately, not every set can be represented by Horn formulas. CM denotes the class of all sets generated by a set of characteristic models.

Reference-contexts: For the third observation, we can show that, given a set of characteristic models M , one can construct a short formula in AC 3 that represents M . From a result in <ref> [ Hastad, 1986 ] </ref> , it follows that the parity function does not have a short AC 3 representation. Since the parity function has a short encoding in P L , it follows that P L 6;AC 3 .

In <ref> [ Kautz et al., 1993 ] </ref> it has been proved that H and CM are orthogonal, i.e. there are situations when one is better than the other for compact knowledge representation. <p> <ref> [ Kautz et al., 1993 ] </ref> it has been proved that H and CM are orthogonal, i.e. there are situations when one is better than the other for compact knowledge representation. However, in Section 4 we give an intriguing method for simulating CM by H: It is also proved in [ Kautz et al., 1993 ] that abduction in CM can be done in polynomial time (the same problem is NP-complete for Horn formulas). The size of a set of characteristic models M f0; 1g n is jM j n. DT is the class of functions represented by decision trees. <p> By the same line of reasoning as in the previous proof we can conclude that the DNF representation of f will have exponential size. 7.

Our first result shows that by introducing additional variables, Horn formulas can efficiently encode sets of characteristic models. This result should be contrasted with that obtained in <ref> [ Kautz et al., 1993 ] </ref> , where it is shown that without the introduction of extra variables there are sets of models that have short characteristic model encodings but no short Horn formula encoding.

Reference-contexts: The size of a circumscribed propositional formula is that of the uncircumscribed formula. DL is the class of all pairs (D; W ) where D is a set of defaults <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> and W is set of propositional formulas. We say that ff is a model of (D; W ) iff there is an extension of (D; W ) satisfied by ff (this is sometimes called sceptical reasoning).

Reference-contexts: The size of a default theory is the total number of defaults in D, plus the total number of connectives appearing in W . Similarly for AEL, autoepistemic logic (this formalism is not treated extensively here). M P is the class of all sets of model-preference defaults <ref> [ Selman and Kautz, 1990 ] </ref> . A model preference default is an object of the form (A ! b), where A is a set of literals and b is a literal.
