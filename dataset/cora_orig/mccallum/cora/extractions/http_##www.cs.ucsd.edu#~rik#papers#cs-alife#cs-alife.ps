Reference-contexts: It is easy to believe that the computer's only role in ALife research is as tools for biologists. The next section suggests, however, that biology 1 I have discussed this similarity at some length elsewhere <ref> [1] </ref>. 1 along with many other sciences is being transformed by this new tool, and hence that even this use of computers should not be trivialized. But Section 3 goes farther.

Reference-contexts: Much more recently, C. G. Langton has argued persuasively that living systems "live near the edge of chaos," again relating organic matter via basic properties shared with the inorganic <ref> [2] </ref>. Note also that this argument for computation in ALife assumes no new computational abilities beyond those typically allowed by the Church/Turing thesis.

Reference-contexts: The need to communicate scientific results to a larger, social group of peers is just as important as the need that the initial formulation, by the solitary scientist, be precise <ref> [3] </ref>. In addition to problems intrinsic to the theoretical language itself, then, are problems attending the communication of scientific discourse.

Reference-contexts: But there are other ways in which this new tool, and the discipline of computer science, are particularly relevant to ALife. 3 Computation is especially relevant to biological systems Modern physics, dating back to at least Heisenberg, has well-established information as a fundamental aspect of the physical world <ref> [4] </ref>. Like any mathematical characterization of the natural world, the notion of information depends on its philosophical roots, and there are many important issues that extend beyond this brief note. For present purposes "information" will be defined according to the theory of information due to Shannon and Weiner.
