Abstract: The paper investigates some issues on clock power consumption in system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. Since clock power consumption is often the largest part of total chip power, research in this area becomes urgent. In a SoC, the clock power depends not only on clock distribution wiring, clock driver sizing and the capability to disable part of the clock network, but also on circuit design style, architectural choice and the clock rate of the IP blocks. The different IP blocks may require that multiple frequency clocks are distributed on the chip. Our research provides a clock power model for SoC that takes into account these various factors. The impact of architectural, design, and logic style on clock power is studied using adder and register designs. In future research, such characterizing information on SoC designs will be used in designing the clock network and estimating its power dissipation.

Reference-contexts: However, clock power depends on various factors such as architectural choices, design styles, clock driver schemes and clock gating mechanisms [13]. The architectural choices include circuit style (such as static, dynamic design) and logic style <ref> [1] </ref> (such as logic depth [11]). The design styles account for the variation due to layout styles, the routing layer and the wiring capacitance. In this paper, the impact of some of these factors on clock power is studied using dynamic adder, dynamic carry generator and register designs.

Reference-contexts: Background There are two common clock driving methods: the single driver scheme and the distributed driver scheme, illustrated in Figure 1. The single driver scheme was preferred earlier for skew optimization since process variations could affect the skew of the distributed driver scheme more <ref> [2] </ref>. However, due to the increased importance of power reduction, the distributed driver scheme that has a much smaller wire capacitance is now preferred. <p> Hence, the total capacitance of the clock wiring is reduced. However, the power consumed in the distributed buffers needs to be accounted. The optimal number of buffer stages, k, inserted in an interconnect with resistance R wire and capacitance C wire to minimize the delay is given by <ref> [2] </ref>: k = (0:4 fl R wire fl C wire )=0:7 fl R out fl C in ) where R out and C in are the output resistance and input capacitance of a minimum size inverter.

Reference-contexts: Low power consumption is an essential requirement for most of these devices due to limited battery power. Clock power consumption is often the largest portion of total chip power. For example, the global clock in the Alpha 21064 consumed 40% of the 30W of power at 200 MHz <ref> [5] </ref>. Hence, it is important to have a detailed understanding of the power consumption behavior of the clock distribution network. Clock power depends on various factors such as the circuit design style, architectural choice, clock distribution wiring, clock driver sizing, and the capability to disable part of the clocking network.

Reference-contexts: To observe the architectural effects on clock power, the clock distribution networks were extracted from a 32-bit domino carry-skip adder, a 32-bit domino carry-look-ahead adder and a 32-bit domino carry-look-ahead adder with optimal transistor sizing from <ref> [6] </ref>. The clock related elements, including metal, polysilicon and via, were selected from the M agic layouts of the adders. Comparisons between Figures 4 and 5 show that the clock network consumes more areas in the carry-look-ahead adder than in the carry-skip adder.

Also, characterizing the power of the clock network has became important. Liu and Svensson [11] present a power estimation model for a single H-tree based clock network in a chip. However, their model is based on the single driver scheme.

Reference-contexts: Such a requirement is illustrated by the 400,000 gate Los Gatos chip that has six independent clock frequencies: 66MHz for the processor; 32.768 MHz for the real-time clock; 33MHz for the PCI interface; and 50, 12.6, and 15.75MHz for the network computer, NTSC and PAL video formats, respectively <ref> [9] </ref>. Our research includes this additional SoC clock distribution requirement. In the next section, the related work in clock power estimation and optimization are discussed. In Section 3, the multiple frequency clocks distributed in a SoC design are described. Section 4 proposes a power model for the clock distribution network.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, clock power is modeled using the distributed driver scheme. This model is then extended to account for multiple clocks required by SoC designs. There are other attempts that model clock power to provide high level system power estimation. Katkoori et.al. <ref> [10] </ref> provide a power estimation method that separately accounts for the power consumed by data-paths, controllers, interconnects and system clock. Among the four parts, the estimation error is maximum for the clock power estimation and ranges up to 30%. <p> We also tried to validate the constant scaling for clock wire capacitance based on bit widths proposed in <ref> [10] </ref>. Though it is a good high level approximation, we found that this model cannot capture some of the layout techniques used in designing larger bit width designs.

Reference-contexts: Efforts for reducing clock power have focussed on issues such as reduced voltage swings, buffer insertion and clock routing for clock power reduction [7]. Also, characterizing the power of the clock network has became important. Liu and Svensson <ref> [11] </ref> present a power estimation model for a single H-tree based clock network in a chip. However, their model is based on the single driver scheme. In this paper, clock power is modeled using the distributed driver scheme. <p> However, clock power depends on various factors such as architectural choices, design styles, clock driver schemes and clock gating mechanisms [13]. The architectural choices include circuit style (such as static, dynamic design) and logic style [1] (such as logic depth <ref> [11] </ref>). The design styles account for the variation due to layout styles, the routing layer and the wiring capacitance. In this paper, the impact of some of these factors on clock power is studied using dynamic adder, dynamic carry generator and register designs. <p> So, the power consumed by the single stage driver can be included in the total wire capacitance to obtain the domain network power given by Domain pow = (1 + Clk Drv )C wire fl V 2 fl f clock where Clk Drv is the clock driver factor <ref> [11] </ref>. In a distributed buffer system, the wire widths need not be doubled as we approach from the leaf nodes to the root of the clock tree. Hence, the total capacitance of the clock wiring is reduced. However, the power consumed in the distributed buffers needs to be accounted. <p> Clocking Network Table 2 compares the power consumed on the clock wiring from the three designs for three different technology processes. As you can see, not only are the total power and the clock wire power scaled down with reducing feature size, as discussed in <ref> [11] </ref>, but also their ratios change. The power consumed on clock wiring decreases with smaller feature size. So does the power dissipated on transistors, but at slower speed.

Reference-contexts: The inaccuracy results from the use of a constant scaling model based on the number of bits in a specific unit. However, clock power depends on various factors such as architectural choices, design styles, clock driver schemes and clock gating mechanisms <ref> [13] </ref>. The architectural choices include circuit style (such as static, dynamic design) and logic style [1] (such as logic depth [11]). The design styles account for the variation due to layout styles, the routing layer and the wiring capacitance.

Reference-contexts: The models capture the relative power between the two styles of clock distribution. The ratios between the two schemes evaluated using the model are in consonance with the 200 to 300% power reduction obtained using the distributed driver as compared to a single driver clock network in <ref> [15] </ref>. The local clock network power depends on the clock load in a IP block.
