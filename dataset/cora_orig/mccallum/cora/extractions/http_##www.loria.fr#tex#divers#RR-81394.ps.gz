Reference-contexts: This graphical manual is composed of pages which can contain icons, text, and sensitive items such as links between pages, pieces of graphical interfaces, etc. The resulting graphical interactive manuals can be integrated within X Toolkit [3] or Wcl/Motif <ref> [1, 4] </ref> applications. They can also be installed as stand alone manuals. <p> Icons syntax: "icon-&lt;bitmap-file-name&gt;- result: produces the icon which bitmap description is stored in &lt;bitmap-file-name&gt;. example: "icon-dragon.bm result: Non popup pieces of interfaces Non popup pieces of interfaces are a combination of Motif widgets <ref> [1] </ref> that do not require creation of a new window to show up.

Reference-contexts: The reason for that is that it is as difficult and time consuming to develop a good quality manual as it is to write a real interface. GIM (Graphical Interactive Manual) is a step towards solving this problem. It provides a L a T E X <ref> [2] </ref> like language, which is used to describe a graphical interactive manual. This graphical manual is composed of pages which can contain icons, text, and sensitive items such as links between pages, pieces of graphical interfaces, etc.
