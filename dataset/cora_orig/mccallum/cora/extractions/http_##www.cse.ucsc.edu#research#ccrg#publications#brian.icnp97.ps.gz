Title: Improving Internet Multicast with Routing Labels

Abstract: The IP-multicast architecture is extended with addressing information along multicast routing trees that permits more efficient and sophisticated multicast routing options and encourages communication and cooperation between IP and higher-layer protocols. The Addressable Internet Multi-cast (AIM) architecture is introduced that enables sources to restrict the delivery of packets to a subset of the receivers in a multicast group on a per-packet basis, permits receivers to listen to subsets of sources on a subscription basis, provides nearest-host routing, and allows higher-layer protocols to place packets into application-defined logical streams, so that hosts may direct the multicast routing of packets based on application-defined contexts. In addition, the Reliable Mul-ticast Architecture (RMA) is introduced to support end-to-end reliable multicasting using heterogeneous reliable multi-cast protocols and providing acknowledgment trees implicitly, thereby eliminating the ACK implosion problem and allowing NAK-avoidance algorithms to work within local groups.

Reference-contexts: This address can then be used by sources to address subsets of the receiver set on a per-packet basis, and by receivers to direct traffic to specific sources. Any prefix labeling scheme for implicit routing along a tree can be used in AIM (e.g., <ref> [1, 14] </ref>); we adopt a simple scheme here as an example. The addressing root of the tree is labeled "1". All children are assigned a positional label that consists of their parent's label as a prefix and, as a suffix, an integer unique in the set of the parent's children.

Reference-contexts: Each Internet router can support more than one host, and routers are organized into multicast routing trees.

Section 2 introduces the Addressable Internet Multicast (AIM) architecture, which generalizes the IP-multicast architecture by introducing group-relative addressing information in multicast routing trees. <p> AIM Definition AIM (Addressable Internet Multicast architecture) generalizes existing Internet multicast services by introducing addressing information as part of the basic structure of mul-ticast routing trees. AIM requires either a source-based or shared multicast routing tree (multicast tree for short), which can be constructed and maintained by CBT <ref> [2] </ref>, OCBT [20], PIM [6], MIP [18], or other protocols. AIM defines an addressing root for each multicast tree, which is used as a reference point for addressing and routing along the tree. <p> The join-ack is forwarded back to the requesting router along the same path by which the join-ack reached the core. fl Readers interested in what "suitable" entails are directed to the original specification of CBT <ref> [2] </ref> AIM requires that the primary core receive a positional label of "1", and to send a new label (as determined by the Assign-Pos-Label () algorithm, Figure 2) with the join-ack in a reserved "label" field.

Reference-contexts: If a stream is specified that is unknown to the on-tree router, then the packet is dropped.

Reference-contexts: A discussion of more sophisticated mechanisms is presented subsequently. Since any reliable multicast protocol may be used within the covey, RMA really acts as an interface between protocols. Similarly, the Reliable Multicast Framework (RMF) <ref> [4] </ref> was designed to act as an interface between reliable mul-ticast protocols. The difference between RMF and our work is that RMA provides a structural support so that any end-to-end reliable protocol can operate with a large receiver set without loss in performance.

Routers wishing to join the tree send a "join-request" to the nearest core. All off-tree routers traversed on the way are forced to join the CBT tree. Once a suitable fl core is reached, the core sends a "join-ack" message to the requesting router.

Reference-contexts: Roundtrip delay is often used as a heuristic for determining the relative location of two hosts <ref> [8, 14] </ref>, despite the fact that roundtrip delay in the Internet is very dynamic and is a poor measure of relative location. <p> When attempting to restrict the scope of a multicast transmission on a per-packet basis, many protocols utilize the time-to-live field present in all IP packets to limit delivery to a locus of routers a limited hop count away <ref> [8, 15, 22, 14] </ref>. However, hop counts are a crude measure of locality of reference for most applications. Alternatively, some protocols may choose to create and tear down separate multicast groups, but this approach is efficient only when a series of packets justifies the overhead [16, 12]. <p> Sessions that do not wish to enforce direct deletion semantics can ignore this part of the RMA definition (e.g., a non-deleting service is provided by SRM <ref> [8] </ref>). We define the children of a covey G to be the set of coveys that contacts G using a positional reachcast service. Likewise, G is the parent of every covey in the set of children. <p> Figure 12 shows the RMA-Route () algorithm for routing packets from one child to all its siblings and its parent. The algorithm calls for the label of the source of the multicast and the label of the parent. Therefore, NAK-avoidance <ref> [8] </ref> or a Ring-based [21] approach between a parent and its children would be feasible, scalable and transparent to the hosts; the construction of a separate multicast group is unnecessary. A sophisticated framework is available for the retransmission strategy as well. <p> Multicasting retransmissions must be done carefully, as it may cause a lot of unnecessary traffic. RMA is different than previous protocols calling for multicast retransmis-sions to a large set of receivers (e.g., <ref> [15, 8] </ref>) because the ack tree built by RMA is always acceptable (this trivially follows from the definition of positional reachcasting).

Reference-contexts: Reach/anycast addresses appear to be standard multicast addresses to routers not on the multicast tree. A special flag indicates to on-tree routers that the packet is a reachcast, and the packet is then handled as an on-tree reachcast. Previous designs for a anycast service <ref> [9] </ref> route packets toward the nearest host belonging to the anycast group according to the unicast routing tables. Once the packet reaches the nearest host, the packet to not forwarded any further. Because reachcast addresses appear to be normal multicast-group addresses, global anycast addresses based on reach-casts are possible. <p> Once the packet reaches the nearest host, the packet to not forwarded any further. Because reachcast addresses appear to be normal multicast-group addresses, global anycast addresses based on reach-casts are possible. In contrast, the approach in <ref> [9] </ref> cannot support global anycast addresses. 4.2. Single-Tree Layered Multicasting The Internet includes very different links, ranging from 28.8 Kbps modems to gigabits per second lines. Sending a uniform bandwidth stream of data may overwhelm under-resourced receivers, and penalize over-resourced receivers.

Reference-contexts: By separating each layer into IP-multicast groups, the responsibility of adapting to an appropriate encoding can be placed at the receivers. To this end, many adaptive protocols have been proposed that determine when the user should join and leave multicast groups (e.g., <ref> [10, 16] </ref>). Streams can be used to support a layered multicast protocol. In this paper, we present only the framework for supporting layered multicasting within Streams. <p> Streams can be used to support a layered multicast protocol. In this paper, we present only the framework for supporting layered multicasting within Streams. The mechanisms used by receiver hosts to decide when to adapt the fidelity of their reception can be the same as those proposed elsewhere (e.g., <ref> [10, 16] </ref>). The ADU label of each packet is based on the level of data encoding. <p> Layered multicast, as implemented in a AIM-extended CBT, PIM, or DVMRP will require only a single tree to be maintained, which is 1=n of the overhead of the n separate multicast groups required in previous approaches based on standard IP-multicast (e.g., <ref> [10, 16] </ref>). The logic is similar to the savings from using one shared tree versus several source-based multicast routing trees. 5. Reliable Multicast Architecture Reliable multicast protocols provide end-to-end reliable many-to-many communication between a number of hosts on an internetwork, over the services of an underlying unreliable multicast routing protocol.

Reference-contexts: Sending a uniform bandwidth stream of data may overwhelm under-resourced receivers, and penalize over-resourced receivers. One approach to this problem is to transmit the data as cumulative layered encodings rather than a single uniform encoding (e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>). Each layer of the cumulative encoding is a refinement of the previous layer's information. Hosts can then choose to receive only as many layers as their available bandwidth allows.

This section introduces RMA (Reliable Multicast Architecture) which routes reliable protocol messages based on the implicit construction of an ack tree by routers.

Reference-contexts: If deletion is desired, registration messages occur between exactly two routers in the tree at all times. RMA overhead is independent of the number of sources, receivers, or packet loss rate. Registration messages are sent only when (and where) the routing tree changes. Recent work by Papadopoulos et al <ref> [17] </ref> is similar to RMA in that it also considers special routing of reliable multicast protocol messages. However, unlike RMA, that proposal has difficulty working over a shared multicast routing tree protocol like CBT or OCBT.
