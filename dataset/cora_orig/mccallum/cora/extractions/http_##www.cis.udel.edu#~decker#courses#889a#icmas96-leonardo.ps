Title: Multi-Agent Meeting Scheduling:  
Abstract: Preliminary Experimental Results Abstract We view meeting scheduling as a distributed task where each agent knows its user's preferences and calendar availability in order to act on behalf of its user. Although we may have some intuitions about how some parameters could affect the meeting scheduling efficiency and meeting quality, we run several experiments in order to explore the tradeoffs between different parameters. Our experiments show how the calendar and preference privacy affect the efficiency and the meeting joint quality under different experimental scenarios. The results show how the meeting scheduling performance is more stable and constant when agents try to keep their calendar and preference information private. We believe that these parameters play a key role in the distributed meeting scheduling task, specially if we are interested in building distributed systems with truly autonomous and independent agents where there is not a fixed control agent.

Reference-contexts: We are specially interested in aspects such as information privacy, negotiation, and group adaptation. However this does not mean that the inherent scheduling problem, which is known as an NP-complete problem <ref> (Garey & Johnson 1979) </ref>, does not have enough importance to be considered. In general, our expectations were confirmed by the experimental results. However, we have discovered some interesting results that we would like to discuss here. We can expect that the efficiency decreases when the difference between individual goals increases.

Reference-contexts: However, there has been much research work in meeting scheduling. Most of the earliest work reached interesting but limited success (Kelley & Chapanis 1982; Greif 1982; Kincaid, Dupont, & Kaye 1985). We can find some interesting approaches in Artificial Intelligence such as (Mitchell et al. 1994) and <ref> (Maes 1994) </ref>; these approaches focus in learning user preferences but they do not take much attention to the social and distributed implications of the distributed meeting scheduling process. We can also find other investigations in Distributed Artificial Intelligence.

We can also find other investigations in Distributed Artificial Intelligence. <p> Each agent has a set of meeting preferences given as inputs for each particular meeting; this set represents its user's meeting preferences (i.e. the three meeting attributes values that are the most preferred by its user). Here it is interesting to note that there are other approaches <ref> (Mitchell et al. 1994) </ref> which focus on learning user preferences using induction trees and taking into consideration several meeting attributes. Eventually, our agents could have communication with one of these systems in order to get the set of user meeting preferences.

Reference-contexts: agents are honest (that is, they do not try to take advantage of the exchanged information in order to manipulate the outcome of the negotiation); they always try to reach the optimal joint meeting quality; finally, as human beings, they first relax their preferences before failing to reach an agreement <ref> (Raiffa 1982) </ref>. Conclusions and Future Directions We have presented some of the preliminary results we obtained through experimentation with our multi-agent meeting scheduling system. This system is based on the communication protocol presented earlier in (Sycara & Liu 1994).

Reference-contexts: very interesting work in distributed meeting scheduling is (Sen & Durfee 1991; 1992; 1993; 1994; 1995); this work has been focused on solving the meeting scheduling problem using a central host agent capable of communicating with all other agents in order to schedule meetings using a negotiation based on contracts <ref> (Smith 1980) </ref>; the main purpose of the host agent is to coordinate the search for a feasible schedule taking into consideration attendees' calendars. However, user preferences are not taken into account during the meeting scheduling process.

Reference-contexts: They presented an alternative approach which is economic in flavor. Using three centralized monetary-based meeting scheduling systems, they analyzed tradeoffs between the mechanism complexity and information preferences and they introduced the Clarke Tax Mechanism as a method for removing manipulability from them. In <ref> (Sycara & Liu 1994) </ref>, it is presented another approach based on modeling and communication of constraints and preferences among the agents. Here the agents are capable of negotiating and relaxing their constraints in order to find and reach agreements on schedules with high joint utility. <p> In addition to its preferences, each agent has weights (values between 0 and 1) that indicate how to relax each time constraint. We implemented a simplified version of the coordination mechanism and communication protocol presented earlier in <ref> (Sycara & Liu 1994) </ref>. In our experiments, agents communicate and negotiate via message passing. Each agent is able to relax its preferences when conflicts arise. The protocol we implemented is as follows: 1. All the agents in the group are randomly enumera ted. 2. <p> The new task coordinator relaxes its time constraints; it broadcasts a new proposal and the process is repeated from point 3. The original coordination mechanism and communication protocol discussed in <ref> (Sycara & Liu 1994) </ref> takes into account multiple-meeting schedules and dynamic changes after a meeting have been approved (e.g. an agent can ask for further negotiation if it realizes that, due to dynamic local changes, it is possible to schedule the meeting again achieving higher utility). <p> Conclusions and Future Directions We have presented some of the preliminary results we obtained through experimentation with our multi-agent meeting scheduling system. This system is based on the communication protocol presented earlier in <ref> (Sycara & Liu 1994) </ref>. The experiments presented in this paper show some of the relationships between different experimental variables, such as calendar and preference privacy. The results show how the meeting scheduling performance is more stable and constant when agents try to keep their calendar and preference information private.

Reference-contexts: There exist several commercial products but they are just computational calendars with some special features (e.g. availability checkers, meeting reminders); in <ref> (Taub 1993) </ref>, a review of several of these products can be found. None of these products is a truly autonomous agent capable of communicating and negotiating with other agents in order to schedule meetings in a distributed way taking into account the user's preferences and calendar availability.
