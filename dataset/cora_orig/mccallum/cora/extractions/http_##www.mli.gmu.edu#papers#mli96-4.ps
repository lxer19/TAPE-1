Reference-contexts: Another knowledge generation operator is based on the PROMISE program <ref> (Baim, 1982) </ref>. It examines the set of attributes in the database and ranks them according to their applicability to a given classification problem. The user can then choose to learn from the subset of the data consisting of only the attributes likely to be more relevant to the learning task.

Reference-contexts: Among the areas intended for future research and development are the addition of tools for creating new attributes for improved performance (constructive induction), based on the AQ17-MCI methodology <ref> (Bloedorn et al, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, one experiment focused on distinguishing between development patterns in Eastern Europe and East Asia <ref> (Kaufman, 1994) </ref>. A conceptual clustering operator determined that one way of distinguishing between the typical Eastern European country and the typical Far Eastern country was through examining the countrys change in the percentage of its population in the labor force between 1980 and 1990. <p> In another experiment, rules were discovered using AQ15c in characteristic mode to generate descriptions of various regions of the world based on some typical core countries in each region, as suggested by a domain expert <ref> (Kaufman, 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It integrates database, knowledge base and machine learning technologies into an intelligent system for data analysis and knowledge discovery. It offers a data analyst a powerful tool for discovering patterns of nonstatistical nature, determining logicstyle data descriptions, and can producing justifications or explanations of the discovered patterns <ref> (Michalski et al, 1992) </ref>. For example, it can describe the data in terms of logicstyle decision rules that link several conditions to a desirable outcome. Individual conditions may contain not only attributes present in the data, but also constructed attributes.

Kodratoff and R.S. Michalski, (Eds.), </editor> <publisher> Morgan Kaufmann, </publisher> <address> San Mateo, CA. </address>
Reference-contexts: This operator can be used in two modes. In the first, each attributes overall discrimination ability is calculated using an information gain metric similar to that used by the C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan, 1990) </ref> family of algorithms in selecting attributes to serve as the roots of the decision trees it generates.

Reference-contexts: The developed countries of East Asia all had very low death rates. To see how well these characterizations fit the other countries in each region, the non-core countries in the examined regions were then tested against the discovered patterns using the rule testing operator developed from the ATEST program <ref> (Reinke, 1984) </ref>. This operator tests a rule set for consistency and completeness. Among the findings was the tendency for island countries to deviate from the mainland norms for their region more than other mainland countries, even when they might appear sociopolitically closer to the regional norms.

Reference-contexts: INLEN currently examines only one relational table at a time. An ongoing research effort is to develop methods for discovering knowledge that is not stored in one location, but rather distributed among several databases <ref> (Ribeiro et al, 1995) </ref>. One approach avoids combining the data from the different sources, instead developing separate knowledge bases and deriving rule-based attributes in order to search for commonalities between the discovered knowledge and the other databases.

Reference-contexts: Two examples below illustrate the choices of parameters for using the knowledge generation operators. One of the backbone abilities of INLEN is rule learning from examples, performed using the AQ15c learning engine <ref> (Wnek et al, 1995) </ref>.
