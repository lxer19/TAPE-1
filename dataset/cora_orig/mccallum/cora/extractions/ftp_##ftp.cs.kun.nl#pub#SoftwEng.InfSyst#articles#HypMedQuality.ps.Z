Abstract: In this article the problem of assessing the quality of hypertext views is considered. This is done in terms of a formal model of hypertext in which the view is a central aspect. The objects in a view are described in terms of so called index expressions which are a powerful object characterization mechanism. These characterizations are manipulated by a calculus, which allows quantification of notions such as cohesion and relevance. These latter are useful criteria for judging the quality of a view.

Reference-contexts: Much of the success of Hypertext can be attributed to the conceptual simplicity of such systems, which makes them easy to use for end-users. An important and developing area in Hypertext is that of views [Con87], [Hal88], [TW86], [DS86], [Yan85], <ref> [Aks88] </ref>. In a general sense, a view of information is partly determined by the type of the underlying information.

Reference-contexts: There are various characterization methods. For example, an object can be characterized by a set of terms. Other forms of characterization are term phrases [Sal89] and trigrams [TS88]. A powerful form of characterization is obtained by the use of index expressions (see [Cra78] and <ref> [Bru90] </ref>). Unlike terms, term phrases and trigrams, index expressions have a structure which is defined by the following grammar (in extended BNF format): IdxExpr ! Term fConnector IdxExprg fl Term ! string Connector ! string A term is typically the name of an entity or entity class. <p> A connector denotes a relationship-type between terms. The connectors are restricted to prepositions, such as `in', `by', and `of'. By explicity denoting the relationship types between the terms, the index expressions provide for more descriptive (thus better) characterizations than terms or term phrases. (See <ref> [Bru90] </ref>). Index expressions can be represented as ordered trees. <p> This movement across the lattice supports the notion of query by navigation [BvdW90]. The lattice structure has been used as the basis of a so called hyperindex in <ref> [Bru90] </ref>. The hyperindex is an index in the form of a hypertext which indexes a hypertext.

Reference-contexts: The large number of variations possible is one of the reasons why authoring remains a largely subjective process. The structure of an application is described in terms of molecules. Most applications have a hierarchical structure. For example, in SGML (see <ref> [ISO15] </ref>) the structure can only be described by a Context Free Grammar. This hierarchical nature is reflected in the schema of Figure 2 by the relation is composed of. At this point we can introduce the concept of view.

Reference-contexts: The relation describes records the relation between frag-ments and characterizations. In the text, the set of characterizations is more conveniently denoted as C.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, if a view is based on a certain theme and there are too many irrelevant aspects with respect to this theme, then this is tiresome for the user. Both of these problems have previously been identified in <ref> [Sha85] </ref>. In this paper we present a way of quantifying the notions of redundancy and irrelevance in views. The formalization of these notions will be of great help to the application builder (or "author"), whose job is to create and maintain views.
