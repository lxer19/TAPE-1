Reference-contexts: These costs are efficiently amortized at larger frame lengths. (These costs are discussed in greater detail when actual measured data is presented.) Additional overhead costs are also inherent in ATM LAN Emulation. Each emulated LAN frame has a LANE header of 2 bytes <ref> [1] </ref>. (Proprietary implementations may add additional bytes to the header.) This header is preceded by the 802.x (IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet; IEEE 802.5 or Token Ring) medium access control (MAC) header, which is 3 bytes for 802.3 [9] and 4 bytes for 802.5 [10].

Reference-contexts: These effects explain reduced throughputs observed above the MTU size for actual data presented later. Likewise, Novell's 2 Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol performance is dramatically improved with burst mode <ref> [2] </ref>. Burst mode defines a window of several frames (e.g., each frame is 4 Kbytes under Token Ring LANE) that can be transmitted back-to-back before an acknowledgment needs to be sent back to the server. <p> The network layer protocols such as IPX, IP, etc. also add protocol headers. The overhead cost is 30 bytes in the case of the IPX protocol <ref> [2] </ref>. Other upper-layer protocol headers (e.g., those associated with NetWare Core Protocol or NCP, which resides above IPX) can 5 Registered trademark of X/Open Company Ltd.

Reference-contexts: Flow control and lost data recovery are the two mechanisms provided by the protocol that have the greatest impact on measured system performance. For example, with IP, TCP attempts to limit data loss and retransmission by managing the maximum amount of outstanding unacknowledged data using window flow control <ref> [3] </ref>. The window size defines the maximum amount of data that will be transmitted before an acknowledgment of receipt is required. This paces, and therefore potentially limits, the amount of data transmitted. Typically, the larger the window size, the greater the throughput. <p> Buffering must also occur at the receiver to accommodate any differences between the network delivery rate and the rate at which the adapter can receive the data and then process it. There are additional costs associated with the reliability of TCP. TCP checksum FACTORS INFLUENCING THROUGHPUT 5 operations <ref> [3] </ref> must compete for the workstation processor along with the device driver, operating system, applications, etc. The effects this has on both available processor utilization and final observed throughput have been discussed previously.

Reference-contexts: This increases throughput dramatically by reducing the total overhead accrued with each window of transmitted data. Effects of Operating Systems Operating systems can also have an impact on the measured throughput. Two examples that can carry significant overhead costs are DOS and OS/2 1 <ref> [4] </ref>. DOS was originally designed around the Intel 3 8086, 20 bit address architecture. This architecture therefore could address no more than 1 MB of memory.

Reference-contexts: Turboways 155 measurements were made point-to-point (direct, adapter-to-adapter). In so far as this is an analysis of end-to-end performance (application layer to application layer), utilizing other ATM hardware (IBM 8260 intelligent hub containing an ATM PRIZMA 1 switch <ref> [5] </ref> and 8282 concentrator), the throughput capabilities of these devices also affect obtained measurements. For a discussion of a number of application experiences (video, ftp, etc.), see [16]. We distinguish between user-level throughput and adapter-level throughput.

Reference-contexts: Each version of AIX has its own version of the ATM device driver. Maximum measured throughputs corresponding to these utilizations are also included in Table 1, and are corrected for overhead. The transmitting and receiving workstations were RISC System/6000 1 model 59Hs. The Netperf benchmark program <ref> [6] </ref> was used to measure Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) throughputs on top of IP (i.e., TCP/IP). Differences in throughputs obtained using Netperf vs. TTCP (presented later) were observed, indicating different overhead costs associated with these benchmark applications.

Reference-contexts: This is accomplished by manipulating the values of the Maximum Receives Outstanding (maxin) and Maximum Transmits Outstanding (maxout) parameters in the protocol.ini file. (For details on these and other parameters which can impact performance, depending on the workstation and the application, see <ref> [7] </ref>.) The maxin and maxout parameters default to a value of 1, which is essentially equivalent to burst off for IPX. Maximum throughputs were observed when these parameters were set to their maximum values of 127 on both the client and server workstations.

Reference-contexts: Each emulated LAN frame has a LANE header of 2 bytes [1]. (Proprietary implementations may add additional bytes to the header.) This header is preceded by the 802.x (IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet; IEEE 802.5 or Token Ring) medium access control (MAC) header, which is 3 bytes for 802.3 <ref> [9] </ref> and 4 bytes for 802.5 [10]. Each 802.x data frame has an optional 4 byte FCS (Frame Check Sequence). The 802.3 data frame may also include a variable length pad if the frame length is less than the minimum 64 bytes.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, most TCP implementations were designed to operate at speeds of less than 10 Mbps. The TCP flow control mechanisms are therefore typically not well suited to ATM network speeds. As a result, TCP extensions for improving performance in high speed networks such as ATM are available (see, e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>). These extensions provide suggestions for increasing buffering for unacknowledged cells (defined by, e.g., tcp sendspace and tcp recvspace for TCP).

Reference-contexts: The effects on observed throughput of different versions of the AIX operating system have already been discussed. Overhead Costs A final important source of reduced bandwidth is inherent in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) definition of an ATM cell (e.g., see <ref> [14] </ref>). Each ATM cell is 53 bytes long, with 5 bytes reserved for the header (control information), leaving 48 bytes for the user payload. A frame must therefore be divided into 48 byte units of data to be sent out over the ATM network. <p> Other ATM speeds may carry additional overhead costs (as defined by the standards bodies). The SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) physical layer interface used for 155.52 Mbps defines a 27 cell frame, reserving one cell for control and management information <ref> [14] </ref>. This reduces the user payload throughput by another 3:7%. There are also a number of fixed overhead costs associated with the processing of a given unit of data, especially one frame's worth. These costs have the worst impact on the throughput of the smallest length frames.

Reference-contexts: For example, if two adapters connected to the bus attempt to use it simultaneously, single ATM adapter half duplex throughput will be reduced. When the shared bus is either Micro Channel 1 (maximum throughput: 40-160 MBps) or Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI; maximum throughput: 132 MBps) <ref> [18] </ref>, it will not become a bottleneck until many more adapters are installed. Likewise, the processor speed of the workstation within which the adapter is installed can have a dramatic effect on throughput. Less powerful machines are generally incapable of delivering frames at media speeds.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, the processor speed of the workstation within which the adapter is installed can have a dramatic effect on throughput. Less powerful machines are generally incapable of delivering frames at media speeds. Effects of processor speed on Turboways 100 adapter throughput are discussed in <ref> [19] </ref> and shown in Figure 1. Given that the adapter device driver must compete for processor cycles with the operating system, protocol, applications, etc., the efficiency with which the driver and protocol stack utilizes the system processor is very important in determining the final observed throughput.
