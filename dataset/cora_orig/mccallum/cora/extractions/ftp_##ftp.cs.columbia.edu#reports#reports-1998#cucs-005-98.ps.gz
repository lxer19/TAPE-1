Abstract: Internet telephony must offer the standard telephony services. However, the transition to Internet-based telephony services also provides an opportunity to create new services more rapidly and with lower complexity than in the existing public switched telephone network (PSTN). The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol that creates, modifies and terminates associations between Internet end systems, including conferences and point-to-point calls. SIP supports unicast, mesh and multicast conferences, as well as combinations of these modes. SIP implements services such as call forwarding and transfer, placing calls on hold, camp-on and call queueing by a small set of call handling primitives. SIP implementations can re-use parts of other Internet service protocols such as HTTP and the Real-Time Stream Protocol (RTSP). In this paper, we describe SIP, and show how its basic primitives can be used to construct a wide range of telephony services.

Reference-contexts: Unlike traditional telephony signaling, we make the signaling of calls independent of the notion of media connections or streams. Note that in contrast to systems such as H.323 <ref> [1] </ref>, we do not require that all participants within a conference have to be aware of the existence of a call. Conversely, a call participant may not be generating media streams. <p> Examples of multimedia control include Etherphone [44], Rapport [45] and MMCC [46, 47]. Etherphone and MMCC are based on a centralized control model, while SIP has no notion of a conference controller or similar device. MMCC did not incorporate call control functionality. The H.323 protocol suite <ref> [1] </ref>, based on the ISDN Q.931 protocols, is being defined as a framework for Internet telephony call control services. SIP attempts to offer a generalized set of services which is not encumbered by H.323's ISDN legacy.

Reference-contexts: For example, the functionality of the SS7 telephony signaling protocol encompasses routing, resource reservation, call admission, address translation, call establishment, call management and billing. In an Internet environment, routing is handled by protocols such as BGP <ref> [2] </ref>, resource reservation by RSVP [3] or other resource reservation protocols [4]. SIP, described here, translates application-layer addresses, establishes and manages calls. There is currently no Internet telephony billing protocol in the Internet, although RADIUS [5], in combination with SIP authentication, may initially serve that purpose.

Reference-contexts: A media session is defined by the membership in a multicast group or a two-party UDP port/address association. Members are identified through the upper-layer transport protocols, e.g., the RTP CNAME <ref> [6] </ref>. A session consists of several media sessions and exists only as a common abstraction in each participant, not in a central registry. A conference is an example of a session. Not all participants in a conference need to be in every media session. Access control is through encryption. <p> Here, Internet-style binary refers to C-like structures with elements aligned on word size multiples or type-length-value tuples. In addition to the core Internet protocols, RTP <ref> [6] </ref>, RSVP [3] and the RADIUS accounting protocol [16] are examples of this approach. This works well as long as protocol requests are flat lists of integers, with few optional parameters and variable-sized structures.

Reference-contexts: A conference is an example of a session. Not all participants in a conference need to be in every media session. Access control is through encryption. This session model is often called the light-weight session model <ref> [7] </ref>; unlike central-registry models, it scales to very large conferences and survives network partitions. A potential participant in such a conference or Internet phone call has to somehow become aware of the existence of a session.

Reference-contexts: offer a ready indication that the recipient has read the message and cannot easily indicate a willingness to participate in a conference. 1 In current Internet multimedia applications using the light-weight session model, sessions and their attributes are announced using a well-known multicast address and a simple textual description (SDP) <ref> [8] </ref>. 1 SIP can use email as a last-resort delivery mechanism, which is useful for inviting users to long-running conferences. 3 This directory model is well suited for public and private pre-planned group events, but does not support telephone calls or inviting participants to a session, nor does it deal with

Reference-contexts: While separate protocols could be used for each of these, SIP tries to address all three modes. Table 1 shows the possible combinations of unicast and multicast signaling and communications. For example, inviting somebody to a multicast conference (e.g., of the type found on the Mbone <ref> [9] </ref>) requires unicast signaling. For automatic call distribution (ACD), where a caller wants to reach the first available person, multicast signaling may be useful. Finally, one may want to invite groups of people to a multicast conference. <p> In particular, the set of tools commonly known as the Mbone conferencing tools <ref> [9, 41, 42, 43] </ref> has achieved widespread use. Examples of multimedia control include Etherphone [44], Rapport [45] and MMCC [46, 47]. Etherphone and MMCC are based on a centralized control model, while SIP has no notion of a conference controller or similar device. MMCC did not incorporate call control functionality.

Reference-contexts: Finally, one may want to invite groups of people to a multicast conference. The last mode differs in that, to avoid request implosion, invitees should not respond to the invitation, except possibly in a carefully rate-controlled way <ref> [10] </ref>. Multicast signaling also requires that potential invitees already expect an invitation, i.e., subscribe to the multicast group. Currently, the Mbone 4 uses multicast announcements to distribute information about upcoming conferences and other multicast events [11]. <p> Since many parties may send SIP messages to a multicast group (particularly in the advertise application), clients must implement a back-off algorithm before sending a message. This algorithm is called reconsideration <ref> [10, 34] </ref>. It allows for fair distribution of bandwidth among senders in a multicast group with a minimal amount of state storage or complexity. Before a client sends, it listens to the group to see if anyone else is sending.

Reference-contexts: Multicast signaling also requires that potential invitees already expect an invitation, i.e., subscribe to the multicast group. Currently, the Mbone 4 uses multicast announcements to distribute information about upcoming conferences and other multicast events <ref> [11] </ref>. It is possible to integrate conference announcements and invitation, although the semantics differ slightly: conference announcements are usually for some time in the future and do not generally alert the user, while invitations request immediate communications. <p> In this way, SIP provides a flexible framework for signaling for both small conferences and very large conferences alike, allowing for a migration from one to the other. Thus, there is no need for a separate announcement protocol such as SAP <ref> [11] </ref>, although the style of user interaction may well be different.

Reference-contexts: Media capabilities convey the media that a participant is capable of receiving and their attributes. Media capabilities and media destinations are conveyed jointly as part of the payload of a SIP message. Currently, the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <ref> [12] </ref> serves as the common format, although others are likely to find use in the future. SDP expresses lists of capabilities for audio and video and indicates where the media is to be sent to. It also allows to schedule media sessions into the future and schedule repeated sessions.

Reference-contexts: SIP uses these addresses as part of SIP URLs, such as sip://j.doe@example.com. This URL may well be placed in a web page, so that clicking on the link initiates a call to that address, similar to a mailto <ref> [13] </ref> URL today. 2 We anticipate that most users will be able to use their email address as their published SIP address.

Reference-contexts: This not only saves space on business cards, but also allows re-use of existing directory services such as LDAP <ref> [14] </ref>, DNS MX records (as explained below) and email as a last-ditch means of delivering SIP invitations.

Reference-contexts: Lookups are by single (primary) key only, not generalized boolean queries across several parameters. Thus, because of the hierarchical nature and the restriction to primary keys only, DNS is not suited for looking up individual subscribers. DNS can, however, be used <ref> [15] </ref> by SIP to map the name of a domain to the name of a server for a specific request, further the published SIP address from the details of service provision. 2 Most browsers currently do not allow to add handlers for non-HTTP protocols, unfortunately. 6 LDAP is a true directory <p> A user first obtains an address where the user is to be called, of the form name@domain. The user then tries to translate this domain to an IP address where a server may be found. This translation is done by trying, in sequence, DNS SRV records <ref> [15] </ref> of type sip.udp and sip.tcp, MX, CNAME and finally A records. Once the server's IP address has been found, the user sends it an INVITE message using either UDP or TCP.

This works well as long as protocol requests are flat lists of integers, with few optional parameters and variable-sized structures. ASN.1 allows the specification of nested data structures with optional elements and a wide variety of basic data types.

Reference-contexts: In the past, text-based protocols were restricted to US-ASCII or, at best, ISO 8859-1 (for HTTP); SIP and RTSP are not burdened by this legacy and can express any ISO 10646 (Unicode) character in the UTF-8 encoding <ref> [17] </ref>. (UTF-8 is a variable-length character set encoding that is upward compatible with US-ASCII.) The final design alternative is to recognize that most control functionality can be modeled as remote-procedure calls.

Reference-contexts: SIP can make use of standard HTTP authentication mechanisms including basic (that is, clear-text password) and digest (challenge-response). Since TCP-based security protocols such as TLS <ref> [24] </ref> are not directly applicable to SIP if run over UDP, we are investigating whether cryptographically signed requests, e.g., using a variant of PGP or S/MIME, might add additional security. For telephony, third-party signing of requests may be particularly useful.

Reference-contexts: SIP, on the other hand, may use any transport protocol that offers either reliable byte stream, reliable or unreliable datagram service, including TCP, RDP <ref> [25] </ref>, UDP, IPX, or AAL5. While assuming a reliable transport protocol would simplify the SIP state machine somewhat, using TCP significantly increases call setup delay. First, the three-way handshake adds 1.5 round trip times of delay.

Reference-contexts: Finally, for some signaling operation such as searching, it is desirable to multicast SIP requests, making UDP preferable. TCP features such as flow and congestion control are not particularly helpful for this application. However, for firewalls and transport-layer security protocol such as TLS <ref> [26] </ref>, use of TCP may be required, so SIP allows both. Even if TCP is used, SIP does not tie the existence of a call to that of the signaling connection. In contrast, H.323 assumes that the call is terminated when the H.245 [27] connection is closed.

Reference-contexts: The forwarding location can be determined in a number of ways. First, a SIP user agent can let the SIP server of a domain know of its presence via a REGISTER message. Other methods include the finger protocol <ref> [28] </ref>, database accesses, for example PSTN Intelligent Network databases, or a query multicast on a local network. All call-forwarding functions are usually instantiated with the Location header field, sent in the 300-class response to the original INVITE message.

Reference-contexts: These decisions can either be automated, or made through user interaction. Since Location URLs can contain any URL, not just SIP URLs, calls can be forwarded between communication domains, for example, to a regular PSTN phone number, a web page for further information, an RTSP URL <ref> [29] </ref> for an answering machine or a mailto URL to leave an email. <p> More interesting services are also possible. Instead of simply ceasing transmission, a user can send another INVITE indicating a multicast address. This multicast address could be fed by a media server which is streaming background music. Since SDP can contain pointers to RTSP <ref> [29] </ref> content, it is even possible to give users remote control over the music they hear while waiting. 6 Interaction with Stored Media Since Internet telephony shares protocols and infrastructure with other Internet multimedia services, it is of interest to explore new combinations of services that span several of these. <p> In this section, we look at several examples. While in no way required for use with SIP, the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) <ref> [29] </ref> is a 23 natural complement to SIP. RTSP's role is to control the delivery of stored multimedia content, including precise control of playback and recording suitable for remote digital linear editing. Perhaps the best example of this is voice mail.

Reference-contexts: Currently, there are products including ICQ (I seek you) that perform similar functionality in the Internet. A primitive form of a buddy list is also found in the current Microsoft NetMeeting conferencing software, where a so-called ILS server records who is on-line and using the software <ref> [30] </ref>. Buddy lists are primarily suited for environments such as dial-up Internet services where people are only sporadically available through the network. However, in a more general sense, they can also serve as an indication of the willingness to communicate with different sets of people.

Before a client sends, it listens to the group to see if anyone else is sending. <p> Reconsideration will allow each server to send a response, but will spread them out uniformly over time. Furthermore, a variation of reconsideration, called unconditional reconsideration, is particularly effective at preventing floods of packets when many users simultaneously send a response <ref> [34] </ref>, as they are likely to try to do here. The ACK and the responses which result are also sent in the same fashion. This will allow a client to establish a signaling relationship with all of the members of a multicast group in a scalable fashion.

Reference-contexts: In the case of reach first, things are more complicated. We desire just one response among all receivers that get the invitation. We observe that this is the same as the NAK-suppression problem in reliable multicast <ref> [35] </ref>. Therefore, when a server receives a multicast invitation with a reach-first disposition, it waits a random amount of time T , and then multicasts a response. Should 22 the receiver hear another server respond before it sends its own response, it cancels its own response. <p> To do this, we mandate that the random variable T is not distributed uniformly (as is done in protocols like IGMP [36] and SRM <ref> [35] </ref>), but rather has a skewed distribution. The skew makes it more likely that a response is sent later rather than earlier. This allows for responses to be sent only sporadically in the beginning, with the response rate picking up as time goes on.

Reference-contexts: In networks with lots of servers listening to a multicast address, and where network delays are large, additional means are needed to reduce the response flood. To do this, we mandate that the random variable T is not distributed uniformly (as is done in protocols like IGMP <ref> [36] </ref> and SRM [35]), but rather has a skewed distribution. The skew makes it more likely that a response is sent later rather than earlier. This allows for responses to be sent only sporadically in the beginning, with the response rate picking up as time goes on.
