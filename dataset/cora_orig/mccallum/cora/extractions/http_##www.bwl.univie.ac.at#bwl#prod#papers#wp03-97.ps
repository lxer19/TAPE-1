Abstract: The ant system is a new meta-heuristic for hard combinatorial optimization problems. It is a population-based approach that uses exploitation of positive feedback as well as greedy search. It was first proposed for tackling the well known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), but has been also successfully applied to problems such as quadratic assignment, job-shop scheduling, vehicle routing and graph colouring. In this paper we introduce a new rank based version of the ant system and present results of a computational study, where we compare the ant system with simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm on several TSP instances. It turns out that our rank based ant system can compete with the other methods in terms of average behavior, and shows even better worst case behavior.

Reference-contexts: The following example (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>) shows how over time, short paths are found through this self-reinforcing process. Suppose that the ants commute between food source A and nest E with speed one, i.e. they need one time unit for a distance of length one (cf. respectively. <p> Other studies (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>) have shown that the ant system yields very good results, when the number of ants is set equal to the number of cities and each ant starts its tour from another city. Such a configuration implies that the complexity of an iteration is O (n 3 ). <p> As long as Q is not too small this parameter is not crucial for the convergence of the algorithm.

This potential drawback is also valid for the ant system. On the other hand, in the ant system algorithm the pheromone trails are updated on basis of the tours of all ants (cf. Section 2.2). <p> A shortcoming of this procedure is the following: if during the evolution the 4 A commonly used technique is the so-called roulette wheel selection (cf. <ref> [11] </ref>). 7 overall solution quality rises and differences between individuals decrease, the differences in selection probabilities decrease, too, and consequently exploitation is not as high as desired.
