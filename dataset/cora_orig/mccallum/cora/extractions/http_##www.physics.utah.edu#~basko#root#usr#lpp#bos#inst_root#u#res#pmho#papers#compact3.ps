Abstract: In this paper we study generic M(atrix) theory compactifications that are specified by a set of quotient conditions. We find a prescription which associates an algebra to each compactification and gives general solutions for the matrix variables. The notion of noncommutative geometry on the dual space is central to this construction. As examples we apply this prescription to orbifolds and orientifolds, including ALE spaces and various quotients of classical and quantum tori. Our study also leads to a new formulation of gauge field theory on quantum spaces.

In this case, the algebra of the U i 's is commutative, and now they are viewed as coordinate functions on the dual (ordinary) torus parametrized by i , and the X's as covariant derivatives. <p> We find (Z a ) ij = m This is exactly what one would expect through the same line of reasoning Taylor used <ref> [8] </ref> for toroidal compactifications. The coefficient a m represents the string stretched between D0-branes separated by m copies of the fundamental region. In the representation (62), U is viewed as an operator that shifts one point in Z n to the next point.

Reference-contexts: In Sec.4 and Sec.5, we will demonstrate our approach for the Klein bottle [14, 15] and the ALE space C 2 =Z n [18].

The quotient conditions are 11 U i X j U i = X j + 2ffi ij R j ; i; j = 1; 2; (88) y 1 ; (89) y 2 ; (90) where T denotes transposition, which is an anti-involution of the algebra. <p> We will consider the case q 3 = 1. For q = 1 we get the same algebra as in <ref> [10] </ref>. Since the general procedure can also work without imposing the relaitons (95), it means that if we had chosen a different reality condition for U 1 and U 2 , the final answer for X will be equivalent. <p> The M (atrix) theory on a cylinder is related to the heterotic string theory <ref> [10] </ref>. It is a gauge theory with the gauge group SU (2N ) in the bulk of the dual cylinder but with the gauge group SO (2N ) on the boundary. One half of the dynamical SUSY is preserved.

Reference-contexts: Different choices of these phases may lead to different solutions, implying that compactification is not completely fixed by the quotient conditions. The algebra (5) is the same as the algebra of a quantum torus <ref> [19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Roughly speaking, ^ G (A) is the isometry group of the dual space. The prescription for deriving the general solution of X was first invented by Zumino <ref> [20] </ref> to study problems in quantum differential calculi on quantum spaces with quantum group symmetry. (Mathematically these two problems are similar in nature.) The prescription is: 7 With a definition of the inner product (integration) one can define the set of "square integrable" functions of the U 's. 8 In fact

Reference-contexts: So eq. (20) is replaced by P (R) = q1. We define the algebra of U , called the U -algebra, by imposing all such relations. It can be shown <ref> [22] </ref> that these relations will be characterized by a projective representation of . Following [16, 17], it is natural to suggest that a nontrivial 2-cocycle on associated with the projective representation corresponds to a nontrivial background field on the compactified space.

Reference-contexts: It is a challenge to find the solution of Z. We will only make a short comment about the compactification on a sphere here. In <ref> [23] </ref> the D0-brane quantum machanics on a sphere is considered as an example of curved backgrounds.

Reference-contexts: As in usual gauge theories, the gauge field A i does not have to be a well defined function on the dual quantum 5 torus. Without going into details about the notion of principal bundle and connection on quantum spaces <ref> [24] </ref>, we simply say that the requirement on A i is that all quantities be invariant under X j ! X j + e ij (15) are well defined. For instance (i log U i ) is only defined up to 2n. <p> The 2 fi 2 unit matrix and K generate the algebra of functions on Z 2 , and * is a derivative on Z 2 in the sense of noncommutative geometry <ref> [24] </ref>. Thus X i can be viewed as covariant derivatives on the dual space which is the product of a classical space parametrized by 1 ; 2 and a quantum space of two points (Z 2 ). <p> In fact U 3 can also be viewed as a function on Z 2 and * as the derivative on Z 2 in the sense of noncommutative geometry <ref> [24] </ref>. Hence the dual quantum space is the product of the dual cylinder with Z 2 . In fact, the form of X resembles the covariant derivative on the dual quantum space as defined in [24, 25]. <p> Hence the dual quantum space is the product of the dual cylinder with Z 2 . In fact, the form of X resembles the covariant derivative on the dual quantum space as defined in <ref> [24, 25] </ref>.
