Abstract: The goal of the DATAMAN project is to develop primitives and build an environment for location depen-dant applications . In such applications, information requested by the user depends on the location from which it is accessed, and which may be invalidated or continue to be valid when a user changes location. Examples include directions to a static/mobile entity, tracking current location of mobile objects, accessing proximate services, and as indicated in [10], binding user application to nearby resources. The communication between the client and the information source/server does not necessarily have to occur over a wireless link. In fact, a mobile client may simply connect to different ports of a fixed network from different locations, and be disconnected in the interim periods. However, the typical scenario will consist of a wireless connection from a mobile client to the information service residing in the static portion of the network. The goals of this paper are twofold: first, we would like to conceptually describe the main primitives necessary to build location-dependant and wireless applications, and second, we describe the preliminary implementation of an intelligent building that demonstrates some of the primitives. We will start with describing the proposed primitives. The implementation is described in the last section. We require that the mobile client be equipped with a mechanism to obtain its current location. This mechanism could either be tied to the tracking scheme used by the static network (to setup a communication path to the client) or be completely independent of it. For example, the client may determine its location via GPS in terms of its absolute geographic coordinates. Alternatively, in a environment with predefined cells, i.e. areas of wireless coverage with a common access point to the fixed network, the client's location can only be pinned down to a cell-id, thereby defining its location relative to the fixed network. Therefore, ``location'' has different connotations depending on the mechanism in use, with a range of granularity from a few square miles in the case of macrocellular structure (as in a cellular telephony/AMPS setting) to a cellsize of the order of meters, e.g. infrared cells within a building as in [4]. The information service that we envision is organised as a collection of pages , with a hyperlink-based Mosaic like interface on the client. Pages may either be active or passive. An active page is one whose contents are sensitive to change of location or time of access. Pages are delivered to a client from a server. The point of access of a page not only determines its contents, but also the server that delivers those contents. This is done in a manner transparent to the client, i.e. the client should not first need to determine which server must it contact to refresh a page upon page-invalidation due to a move. Scope The set of locations in which the contents of a page are valid is termed its scope. Scope of a page will vary substantially depending on its contents, and in many cases mirror the geographic region in which it is valid. For example, pages that reflect

Reference-contexts: Delta Publication Mode The server will not multi-cast entire pages and instead, send only the delta or difference in page contents. Alternatively, it could send an invalidation notification on receipt of which interested clients can individually access the updated page if desired, i.e switch to an on demand mode <ref> [1] </ref>. In principle, a server can autonomously select any of the desired dissemination modes. However, when a client moves outside of the scope of a page, it must first determine the mode in which the server covering its current cell is disseminating the page.

Reference-contexts: To detect such invalidations, an active document lists the environment variables which affect its validity. Since these variables are ``global'', i.e. their values can be changed by entities other than the local client, Mobisaic uses the Zephyr notification system <ref> [3] </ref> as a publication-subscription mechanism to propagate changes to dynamic variables to interested parties.

Reference-contexts: Publication Mode If a page is requested often and by multiple clients, the server instead of replying to individual requests, can periodically multicast the page at a predefined address <ref> [6] </ref>. We propose using the nar-rowcast primitive to support this mode as well. A page is narrowcast from a server (periodically) to reach all mobile clients in the cells covered by the server; thus, the clients listen to the narrowcast address.

Reference-contexts: For example, the URL http://128.6.4.7/cgi-bin/floor-map?128.6.157.131 encodes the address of the server (128.6.4.7), the service desired (/cgi-bin/floor-map) and the present location of the client (the cell under MSS 128.6.157.131, using the Mobile-IP scheme of <ref> [7] </ref>). The above centralized scheme has the disadvantage that the server must store page contents and scope for each location/cell, in the system. The advantage is that clients can use the same address to contact the server from any location. <p> Implementation Status a Portions of the overall project have been implemented separately. The canonical application is a What's around me? interface, providing locations of proximate services such as nearby printers and directions to various offices from the user's current location within a building. Client mobility is supported via Mobile-IP <ref> [7] </ref>, and the building is divided into cells with the IP address of the MSS identifying a location. On startup, the user's current location is encoded as a parameter in the URL to access a central server, which returns the floor plan for the user's current location (Fig. 1).

Reference-contexts: We restrict the number of such hosts to one, since it allows a one-to-one transport-layer connection to be set-up between a mobile client and the nearest server. 2 This is similar to the concept of anycast proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>, but with a critical difference, viz. a anycast packet may be routed to any of the servers listening to a common anycast address, while a narrowcast packet will be routed to a specific server depending on the source of the packet.

Reference-contexts: Further, the incremental directions are tagged with a scope (Fig. 6) to provide directions in increments greater than one ``hop'', i.e. guide a user between nonadjacent cells. Related Work a The work that is perhaps closest to ours, is Mobisaic <ref> [11] </ref>. Mobisaic extends Mosaic as a information-browser for mobile clients by introducing two new constructs: dynamic URLs and active documents. Dynamic URLs reference environment variables whose values change dynamically, either due to change in user locations or time. <p> Though similar in aim, viz.location-dependant information browsing, our proposed approach is complementary to Mobisaic. <ref> [11] </ref> presents new language-level (HTML) constructs for writing active pages and specifying dynamic URLs and implements the necessary interaction between various entities via Zephyr.
