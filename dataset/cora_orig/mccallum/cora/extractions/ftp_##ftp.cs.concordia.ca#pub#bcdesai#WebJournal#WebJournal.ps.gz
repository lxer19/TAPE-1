Abstract: An increasing number of research institutes, universities and business organizations are currently providing their reports, articles, catalogs and other information resources on the Internet in general and the Web [4, 3] in particular. This is now becoming the accepted method of disseminating and sharing information resources in hyper-media. At this time a number of information sources, both public (free) and private (available for a fee), are available on the Internet. They include: text, computer programs, books, electronic journals, newspapers, organizational local and national directories of various types, sound and voice recordings, images, video clips and scientific data. Also, private information services such as price lists and quotations, databases of products and services, and specialty newsletters are available. The current trend in the use of hyper-media and many of the documents accessible via the Internet using various browsers are great showcases for the features of the system. The practicality, however, of using links to related documents is both over utilized and a cause of annoyance to the users. A link in a document being perused leads the reader from one document to another, with in turn more links to tertiary documents. The user eventually gets lost and feels trapped in the web. A number of browsers have been developed which allow ease in accessing this information on the Web. Mosaic[7] is one of the more popular ones. Users, while accessing such information resources, follow links from one document to another. Without a good method of recording their travels on this information highway, they could get "lost". Some of these browsers, record the user's path in a list and allow the user to return to any of these pre-visited documents. However, the relationship among the pre-visited documents is not preserved. Nor is it possible

Reference-contexts: WebJournal is written in Motif 1.2.3. The widget used to draw the nodes and edges is a modified version of the Tree widget described in [8] 5 . Extra code was added to this widget to draw the dashed lines. Communications between Mosaic and WebJournal is through 2 pipes <ref> [1] </ref>. One pipe is for communication from Mosaic to WebJournal, while the other one handles communication in the reverse direction. Instructions between the processes are very simple instructions such as fetch this URL or such a URL has arrived.

Reference-contexts: The latter is modified to allow it to share information with the WebJournal and provide it with a method of displaying the required documents. The WebJournal provides a two dimensional tree of visited hyper-media documents. The nodes could be labeled with the order of its visit, the URL <ref> [2] </ref> of the resource visited or the title of the resource visited [5]. The user can select any of these labeling schemes.

Reference-contexts: The WebJournal provides a two dimensional tree of visited hyper-media documents. The nodes could be labeled with the order of its visit, the URL [2] of the resource visited or the title of the resource visited <ref> [5] </ref>. The user can select any of these labeling schemes. In the latter two cases, however, the nodes tend to be large and the visualization of the journey is lost due to the limited size of the screen. page (node 1).

Reference-contexts: As such, there is a need for a system which allows the visualization of a journey through the Web and, furthermore, provides ease in selectively marking documents for later review or sharing with colleagues. The WebJournal <ref> [6] </ref> is such a graphical system which provides users with a pictorial representation of their search of resources on the Internet and allows random access to these visited resources. It keeps track of links including figures and postscript documents.

Mosaic <ref> [7] </ref> is one of the more popular ones. Users, while accessing such information resources, follow links from one document to another. Without a good method of recording their travels on this information highway, they could get "lost". <p> Marking interesting resources and collecting these and storing them in a named file for later perusal or sharing is also possible. The marking of selected documents for printing is also possible. 1.2 Journaling a Web Journey WebJournal, in its current implementation, works in conjunction with the Mosaic browser <ref> [7] </ref>. The latter is modified to allow it to share information with the WebJournal and provide it with a method of displaying the required documents. The WebJournal provides a two dimensional tree of visited hyper-media documents.

Reference-contexts: Once all the marked documents are printed the clone Mosaic window used for printing is automatically closed. 1.5 WebJournal Internals, communications. WebJournal is written in Motif 1.2.3. The widget used to draw the nodes and edges is a modified version of the Tree widget described in <ref> [8] </ref> 5 . Extra code was added to this widget to draw the dashed lines. Communications between Mosaic and WebJournal is through 2 pipes [1]. One pipe is for communication from Mosaic to WebJournal, while the other one handles communication in the reverse direction.
