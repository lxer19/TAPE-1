Abstract: We consider uncertain linear systems where the uncertainties, in addition to being bounded, also satisfy constraints on their phase. In this context, we define the "phase-sensitive structured singular value" (PS-SSV) of a matrix, and show that sufficient (and sometimes necessary) conditions for stability of such uncertain linear systems can be rewritten as conditions involving PS-SSV. We then derive upper bounds for PS-SSV, computable via convex optimization. We extend these results to the case where the uncertainties are structured (diagonal or block-diagonal, for instance).

Reference-contexts: Uncertainty is often best represented by a set of full matrices (or block-diagonal matrices), and handling this situation in our framework necessitates a concept of "phase of a matrix". Several authors have proposed such concepts. In <ref> [9] </ref>, the "principal phases" of a matrix are defined as the arguments of the eigenvalues of the unitary part of its polar decomposition, and a "small phase theorem" is derived that holds under rather stringent conditions. <p> Finally, the phase information of a matrix is invariant under unitary similarity transformations (since the numerical range is). Median phase and phase spread are related to the concept of principal phases introduced by Postlethwaite et al. in <ref> [9] </ref>. Namely, for any square complex matrix , MP () PS () min () max () MP () + PS () where min () and max () are the minimum and maximum principal phases of , respectively.

Remark: There is a more direct method of analyzing parameter-dependent systems, namely "real-" analysis (see <ref> [21] </ref>). It is of interest to compare PS-SSV-based stability methods with real- methods. Let us consider the question of whether the system in Fig. 9 (b) is uniformly robustly stable. The answer is affirmative in the PS-SSV framework if sup !2R e (P (j!))^ fi (!) is less than one. <p> Thus, the number of scalar variables is 6. There is one LMI constraint of size 2 fi 2, and 6 scalar constraints. When the uniform robust robust stability of the same system is posed in the real- framework of <ref> [21] </ref>, we once again have to solve an LMI feasibility problem at each frequency. Here the variables in each problem are diagonal 6 fi 6 matrices D = D T and G = G T (see [21] for details); thus the number of scalar optimization variables is 12. <p> robust robust stability of the same system is posed in the real- framework of <ref> [21] </ref>, we once again have to solve an LMI feasibility problem at each frequency.

There is one LMI constraint of size 6 fi 6, and 6 scalar constraints. For the problem of uniform robust stability with parametric uncertainties, PS-SSV-based tests are likely to be more conservative than real- tests.

Thus, a sufficient condition for the feasibility of problem (19) can be recast as an LMI feasibility problem. A bisection scheme can then be used to compute an upper bound for ^ M fi (P ).

Reference-contexts: A bisection scheme can then be used to compute an upper bound for ^ M fi (P ). It is also possible to avoid the bisection scheme altogether, by recasting the upper bound computation problem as a single generalized eigenvalue minimization problem; see <ref> [30] </ref>. 5 Numerical examples We demonstrate on a few examples the application of stability tests based on the PS-SSV. 5.1 Example 1: Stability of a flexible structure We consider the stability of a planar truss structure, with a model adapted from the one presented in [5].

Reference-contexts: For our example, empirical studies indicate that the computation required by real 24 methods is approximately 12 times that required by PS-SSV-based methods <ref> [31] </ref>. 3 Thus, the PS-SSV approach can be useful in analyzing parameter-dependent systems, albeit more conservatively, when the number of parameters is large. 5.3 Example 3: Experimentally measured matrix phase information We consider an uncertain system as in Fig. 1, where the plant P is strictly proper (i.e, P (1) =
