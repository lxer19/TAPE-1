Title: Pricing in Computer Networks: Motivation, Formulation, and Example  
Author: Ron Cocchi ; Scott Shenker Deborah Estrin Lixia Zhang 
Date: November 18, 1993  
Abstract: We study the role of pricing policies in multiple service class networks. We first argue that some form of service-class sensitive pricing is required for any multiclass service discipline 4 to attain the desired level of performance. Borrowing heavily from the Nash implementation paradigm in economics, we then present an abstract formulation of service disciplines and pricing policies. This formulation allows us to describe more clearly the interplay between service disciplines and pricing policies in determining overall network performance. Effective multiclass service disciplines allow networks to focus resources on performance sensitive applications, while effective pricing policies allow us to spread the benefits of multiple service classes around to all users, rather than just having these benefits remain exclusively with the users of applications that are performance sensitive. Furthermore, service disciplines and pricing policies combine to form the incentive system facing a user; these incentives must be carefully tuned so that user self-interest leads to optimal overall network performance. Finally, we illustrate some of these concepts through simulation of several simple example networks. In our simulations, we find that it is possible to set the prices so that users of every application type are more satisfied with the combined cost and performance of a network with service-class sensitive prices. For some application types the performance penalty received for requesting a less-than-optimal service class is offset by the reduced price of the service. For the other application types the monetary penalty incurred by using the more expensive, higher-quality service classes is offset by the improved performance they receive. 5

Reference-contexts: A single class service discipline treats all packets as equivalent (e.g., FIFO), whereas a multiclass service discipline can treat the various classes of packets differently (e.g., different priority levels). 5 This paper is an extensively revised version of Reference <ref> [2] </ref>. 1 transfers, electronic mail, X-server connections, voice, and video. Furthermore, significantly faster and more sophisticated networks are currently being designed and prototyped; it is expected that these networks will spark a whole new generation of applications. However, such technical progress is not the only important issue affecting network performance.

Reference-contexts: There is also a sizable literature on congestible facilities. The standard models, as represented by [25], invoke ad hoc formulae to describe the effect of congestion on users. The structural models, as represented by <ref> [3] </ref>, derive these congestion effects directly from the dynamics of the congested facility itself. In that sense, this structural approach is similar to ours; however, these structural models of congestion, with their emphasis on peak and off-peak usage, are rather different from the network model we have considered here.

Reference-contexts: Recent discussion of resource usage feedback mechanisms has identified several somewhat independent design choices such as feedback channel (e.g., monetary, administrative), feedback policy (e.g., based on quality of service delivered or priority level requested), and granularity (e.g., charge back to end users or to institutions for aggregate traffic) <ref> [4] </ref>. We have not addressed the many implementation and protocol support issues that arise in the context of any usage sensitive pricing systems. In particular, we have not dealt with the issues of accounting and authentication, which must be confronted before pricing can become a reality.

The improvement in performance when the delays are reduced well below this limit is slight.

Reference-contexts: However, we do expect that the fundamental pricing issues raised by this simple approach will resemble those of more complicated service disciplines. There is a surprisingly small literature on the relationship between network performance and application performance. Those studies that have been done have focused on voice <ref> [18] </ref>. The other application performance measures V application we described are probably indicative of the primitive state-of-the-art in this regard. One of the points of our work is to apply these V 's to network performance under different loads and service disciplines in order to measure relative user satisfaction.

Reference-contexts: The problem we address is similar to and the conclusions we reach are consistent with those of the priority pricing literature in economics, which discusses the supply of nonstorable goods like electrical power (see Reference <ref> [26] </ref>). Our discussion is quite different from the standard literature on externalities (as represented by [8]) and also quite different from the literature on telephony pricing (as represented by [14]). <p> We consider two different pricing schemes. The first is a flat per-byte price applied to all packets traversing a link, call it p flat . In the second pricing scheme, called priority pricing (based on a theoretical analysis of a similar problem in <ref> [26] </ref>), we charge different per-byte prices for the two priority classes. Let us denote these two per-byte prices by p high and p low ; clearly we should set p high p low so that the monetary incentives encourage the use of the low priority service class. <p> Thus, we do not have the personalized prices required to invoke the standard externality result. In fact, our model is more specifically related to the priority pricing literature, as represented by <ref> [26] </ref>, than to the standard externality literature. This literature considers a simple model of allocation of a nonstorable good with fluctuating supply and constant demand; Reference [26] shows that there are certain priority pricing schemes that can make everyone better off, when compared to a flat pricing scheme. <p> In fact, our model is more specifically related to the priority pricing literature, as represented by <ref> [26] </ref>, than to the standard externality literature.
