Title: SEQUOIA 2000 METADATA SCHEMA FOR SATELLITE IMAGES  
Author: Jean T. Anderson and Michael Stonebraker

Abstract: Sequoia 2000 schema development is based on emerging geospatial standards to accelerate development and facilitate data exchange. This paper focuses on the metadata schema for digital satellite images. We examine how satellite metadata are defined, used, and maintained. We discuss the geospatial standards we are using, and describe a SQL prototype that is based on the Spatial Archive and Interchange Format (SAIF) standard and implemented in the Illustra object-relational database.

Reference-contexts: Each band is composed of 2889 lines and 4587 samples. The database metadata schema should support both viewpoints. 2.2 Satellite Image Metadata How researchers access the data largely drives which metadata are stored. Dozier <ref> [2] </ref> provides two examples of how researchers would like to query raster data: * Select all daytime AVHRR images for the Southern Sierra Nevada between October 1991 and June 1992 and sort chronologically. * Find the Landsat Thematic Mapper image closest to April 1, 1992, for the Bubbs Creek area that

Reference-contexts: First we introduce some satellite basics and describe a satellite image. The satellite images described in this paper are end products produced by the EROS Data Center <ref> [3] </ref>. Next we identify the metadata elements specific to a satellite image as well as some broader categories of metadata associated with a data set. 2.1 Satellite Image Basics The AVHRR sensor has five channels that collect measurements in different wavelengths. <p> The second query additionally requires access to information in the bands. In other words, the metadata supporting these queries must include temporal and spatial information as well as the structure of the raster. Table 1, below, summarizes metadata for a single satellite image from <ref> [3] </ref>, organized into three sections described in greater detail: Grid, Spatial Registration, and Temporal Information. The grid for the sample AVHRR data set was introduced briefly in the previous section; i.e., it is made up of 10 bands, and each band has 2889 lines and 4587 samples.

Reference-contexts: Rather, transformation services should support an evolving schema and should provide a mechanism for extending the underlying model. Transformation between data models, or schemas, is an important research area. Rosenthal <ref> [10] </ref> describes an approach that uses a unified underlying data model comprised of the union of all features, noting that the complexity of a unified model is increased by any extensions made to it.

Bright <ref> [11] </ref> uses a global data structure, generated from an online system taxonomy, that contains concise descriptions of data available in all input schemas. The resulting global structure (the `summary schema') is smaller and easier to modify than a union of all schemas.

The resulting global structure (the `summary schema') is smaller and easier to modify than a union of all schemas. Sciore <ref> [12] </ref> describes an approach that is independent of any data model. Instead, the metadata (the `context') is attached to the value and conversion functions handle transformations between source and target contexts. These approaches are applied to the relational model; each would need to be extended to handle object-oriented capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Text-based systems will become increasingly important to automate metadata entry of data set descriptions. For example, the GIPSY <ref> [13] </ref> prototype automatically extracts geospatial information from text documents. 5.4 Object Descriptions Entry and maintenance of object descriptions can be partially automated, first by taking advantage of database system catalogs that maintain base information about all user objects. An ancillary object description table stores additional detailed information.
