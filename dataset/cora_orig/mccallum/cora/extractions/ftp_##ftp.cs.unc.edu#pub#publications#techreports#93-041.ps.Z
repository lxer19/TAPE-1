Title: Using Texture Memory to Generate Anti-aliased Image Textures on PixelFlow

Abstract: PixelFlow is an experimental parallel graphics computer under design at UNC. This document discusses issues concerned with using PixelFlow's texture memory to generate anti-aliased image textures. These include: perspective interpolation of texture coordinates and texture gradients, mip-map memory organization and address generation, schemes of loading textures into texture memory, and parallel algorithms for generating mip-maps of textures through pre-filtering. Finally, a texture memory manager based on the buddy system is outlined.
