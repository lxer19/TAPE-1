Abstract: We consider the extended linear complementarity problem (XLCP) introduced by Mangasarian and Pang [22], of which the horizontal and vertical linear complementarity problems are two special cases. We give some new sufficient conditions for every stationary point of the natural bilinear program associated with XLCP to be a solution of XLCP. We further propose some unconstrained and bound constrained reformulations for XLCP, and study the properties of their stationary points under assumptions similar to those for the bilinear program.

Reference-contexts: Proof: For functions 1 ; 2 and 3 , the assertions can be checked by direct observation. For the Fischer-Burmeister function 4 , all properties except V are well known (see, for example, <ref> [11] </ref>). We proceed to prove V. Let '(a; b) := 2 a 2 + b 2 a b : With this notation, 4 (x; y) = i=1 Let ' a and ' b denote partial derivatives of ' with respect to a and b, respectively. <p> For the implicit Lagrangian 5 , the equivalences hold under the same assumptions as for 1 ; 2 or 4 , except that copositiveness of M N &gt; on (0 + P) fl has to be replaced by strict copositiveness. This is also consistent with some results <ref> [11] </ref> for standard complementarity problems. We also tried to use the feasible set B = f (x; y) j x 0g 11 thus keeping only nonnegativity constraints for x, as one would naturally try for the restricted implicit Lagrangian 6 (or another function considered in [30]).

Reference-contexts: Clearly, situation with the BLP (2) associated with XLCP is very similar. In recent years, considerable amout of research on complementarity problems has focused on obtaining optimization reformulations with simple constraints. Of particular interest are unconstrained reformulations (for example, <ref> [24, 19, 15, 6, 16, 26, 4, 18, 20, 17, 23] </ref>) and reformulations where the feasible set contains only nonnegativity constraints (see [10, 24, 9, 3, 30, 7]). Research in this direction is vast and is by no means limited to the cited references.

For example, bound constrained reformulations can be also constructed for the variational inequality problem [27]. <p> We also tried to use the feasible set B = f (x; y) j x 0g 11 thus keeping only nonnegativity constraints for x, as one would naturally try for the restricted implicit Lagrangian 6 (or another function considered in <ref> [30] </ref>). While some results can still be obtained with those reformulations, they seem to be overall weaker than Theorem 2. 4.

Reference-contexts: For example, copositiveness of M N &gt; was replaced by a more general X-row-sufficiency property. It was also pointed out in the latter reference that the XLCP stated here is essentially equivalent to the "general linear complementarity problem" considered by Ye <ref> [33] </ref> in the context of interior points algorithms. In this paper, we give some new sufficient conditions for every KKT point of BLP (2) to be a solution of XLCP (1).
