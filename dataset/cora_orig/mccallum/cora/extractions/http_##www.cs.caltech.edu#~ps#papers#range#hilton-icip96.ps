Abstract: A new surface based approach to implicit surface polygo-nisation is introduced in this paper. This is applied to the reconstruction of 3D surface models of complex objects from multiple range images. Geometric fusion of multiple range images into an implicit surface representation was presented in previous work. This paper introduces an efficient algorithm to reconstruct a triangulated model of a manifold implicit surface. A local 3D constraint is derived which defines the Delaunay surface triangulation of a set of points on a manifold surface in 3D space. The `Marching Triangles' algorithm uses the local 3D constraint to reconstruct a Delaunay triangulation of an arbitrary topology manifold surface. Computational and representational costs are both a factor of 3-5 lower than previous volumetric approaches such as marching cubes.

Reference-contexts: In the case where the points, X, lie on a manifold surface, S, Boissonnat <ref> [1] </ref> derives the following important property. <p> A local 3D Delaunay manifold surface is guaranteed provided the triangle, T , satisfies the condition that no part of the existing model is inside an arbitrary sphere passing through the three triangle vertices, <ref> [1] </ref>. Defining the sphere about the equi-distant point in the element plane enables this constraint to be satisfied. If different surface regions are in close proximity the sphere about the center, c T , may intersect another surface region but will still give a valid local triangulation. <p> Step (5) allows the local connection of existing model vertices to form a continuous surface representation. Marching triangles does not impose any constraint on the position of new vertices. In particular mesh vertices are not constrained to lie at measurement points unlike previous mesh growing procedures <ref> [1, 7] </ref>. This facilitates adaptive mesh growing by evaluating the projected distance, l proj , according to the local surface geometry. 4.

Reference-contexts: Hence, building a model using this constraint guarantees that the local surface does not over-fold or self-intersect. In addition by imposing a constraint that ensures the surface is locally Delaunay we ensure that the resulting triangulated model, M , is globally Delaunay, Fortune <ref> [2] </ref>. The circumcenter in the triangle plane, c T , is taken as the fourth point required to define a sphere for each triangular element.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Automatic reconstruction of integrated 3D models from multiple 2.5D range images is a primary goal of recent research [4, 7, 8, 9]. A volumetric approach to geometric fusion based on an intermediate implicit surface representation was recently introduced <ref> [3] </ref>. This provides a framework for reliable integration of multiple images to ensure consistent representation of the local surface geometry and topology based on measurement uncertainty. In previous work the Marching Cubes approach was used to reconstruct a triangulated model from the implicit surface representation. <p> A boundary function b (x) is defined which is `false' if the nearest point is internal to the surface and `true' if the nearest point is on the boundary. Integration of multiple range images into a single implicit surface representation was introduced in <ref> [3] </ref>. Given an implicit surface representation, [f (x); b (x)], of an arbitrary topology manifold surface the triangulation algorithm proceeds as follows. Firstly an initial seed model, M = M 0 , is defined. <p> COMPLEXITY AND LIMITATIONS Defining a general form for the computational complexity of any range image integration algorithm is not possible as it is a function of the particular image set, <ref> [8, 3] </ref>. The worst case computational complexity is approximated for integrating m images of N points assuming O (N ) redundant measurements between each pair of images. <p> CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented a new method for model reconstruction from multiple range images. Integration consists of two stages. Geometric fusion of multiple range images into a single implicit surface representation which defines the local surface topology and geometry, as presented in previous work <ref> [3] </ref>. Model reconstruction is then achieved by implicit surface polygonisation. A surface based approach for implicit surface polygonisation has been introduced in this paper and is refered to as `Marching Triangles'. Previous implicit surface polygonisation algorithms such as marching cubes use volumetric primitives (cubes or tetrahedra).

Reference-contexts: Assuming the model is triangulated at approximately the same spatial resolution as the original measurements and using the Euler formula <ref> [5] </ref> the number of implicit surface function evaluations is O (mN ). Hence, the time complexity of the static Marching Triangles integration algorithm is O (m 2 N ). Dynamic integration of a single range image requires the evaluation of the implicit surface for a single mesh.
