Reference-contexts: The computational support involves persistent programming support that combines compiler, database and other technology and that is transparent with respect to scientifically irrelevant computation details. The concept of CMS is a significant extension of existing evolutionary approaches (e.g., <ref> [27, 41, 42, 40, 39, 12, 31, 1, 25, 20, 21] </ref>). The CMS framework of [35] uses a conceptual (CMS) data model which generalizes semantic (e.g., ER [9], SDM [17], etc.) and object-oriented data models (e.g., Gemstone [11], Vbase [3], ORION [4], O 2 [23], etc.).

Reference-contexts: For the rest of the paper we will describe CML and how it can be used to provide the computational environment necessary for developing scientific modeling applications. Details of the methodology of providing access to data located at sites distributed over the network, are discussed elsewhere <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 A High-Level Computational Modeling Language (CML) We describe here the simple, largely declarative language CML for expressing scientific modeling and database operations.

Reference-contexts: The CMS framework of [35] uses a conceptual (CMS) data model which generalizes semantic (e.g., ER [9], SDM [17], etc.) and object-oriented data models (e.g., Gemstone [11], Vbase <ref> [3] </ref>, ORION [4], O 2 [23], etc.). In particular, the CMS data model is based on a sound characterization of scientific activities that employs the concepts of concrete and abstract representational structures (R-structures).

Reference-contexts: Abstract R-structures provide external specifications of concrete R-structures in a manner similar to abstract data types <ref> [5] </ref>. The R-domain of a concrete R-structure specifies representations of all the entities. This specification involves a structural component and a value component that is specified in terms of a set of constraints on the subcomponents in the structural representation.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, in CML users must designate which specific concrete R-domains of the super abstract R-domains may be used for inheritance; furthermore, the structures must be compatible under the usual sub-typing rules <ref> [6, 8, 7] </ref>. The user may also name the elements by values of type string. Although these names play the same role as object identifiers, this provision in CML provides flexibility and ease in scientific modeling activities.

Reference-contexts: An important relationship that must be associated with concrete each R-structure C is the equality predicate C , to indicate when two representations in a given concrete R-domain represent the same entity.

An important set of transformations that must be defined on the R-domains of equivalent R-structures map equivalent sets of representations in the two R-domains onto each other, since it is required that the R-domains of equivalent R-structures be isomorphic in the following sense.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [35] </ref>, we have developed a framework for computational modeling systems (CMS). Such systems are designed to provide scientific investigators with computational support that allows them to achieve their scientific goals more efficiently. <p> The concept of CMS is a significant extension of existing evolutionary approaches (e.g., [27, 41, 42, 40, 39, 12, 31, 1, 25, 20, 21]). The CMS framework of <ref> [35] </ref> uses a conceptual (CMS) data model which generalizes semantic (e.g., ER [9], SDM [17], etc.) and object-oriented data models (e.g., Gemstone [11], Vbase [3], ORION [4], O 2 [23], etc.). <p> This paper makes the following contributions. At the conceptual level, a framework is presented which allows operations relating to distinct software subsystems to be provided in terms of a single unified environment. The technique is based on abstract and concrete representations of datasets reported in <ref> [35] </ref>. At the implementation level, we have developed a generic technique which allows a CMS to start a subsystem (external tool) as a background server process and to establish the communication channels between the main system and the server process. <p> TRANSFORMATION polygon eq (x:polygon, y:polygon) RETURN eq: BOOL; BEGIN VAR eqs: SET OF BOOL; eqs = ACCESS f TRUE FOR z IN prefix (SEQ (x)) WHERE seq eq (append (left div (x,z),z), SEQ (y)) g; eq = nonempty (eqs); END Special classes of methodological R-structures are also provided in CML <ref> [35] </ref>. Modeling schemas contain representations of certain aspects of the process of model development. Associated operations allow users to run and debug computations. In the context of database systems for coordinated scientific investigation activities, project is clearly a very important notion.

Reference-contexts: Activities that require such support during the iterative process of model development [29, 18] range from the acquisition and manipulation of raw data to the construction and evaluation of complex sets of mathematical equations <ref> [32, 13, 10, 19, 36, 37, 38, 16, 15, 24, 26] </ref>. Integrated computational support for scientific modeling activities, however, is a difficult goal to achieve for a variety of reasons. The construction of scientific models of phenomena is a complex, interactive and highly iterative process.
