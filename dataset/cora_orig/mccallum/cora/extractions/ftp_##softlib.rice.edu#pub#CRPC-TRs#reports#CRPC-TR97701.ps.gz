Abstract: We analyze a space-time domain decomposition iteration, for a model advection diffusion equation in one and two dimensions. The asymptotic convergence rate is superlinear, and it is governed by the diffusion of the error across the overlap between subdomains. Hence, it depends on both the size of this overlap and the diffusion coefficient in the equation. However, it is independent of the number of subdomains. The convergence rate for the heat equation in a large time window is initially linear and it deteriorates as the number of subdomains increases. The duration of the transient linear regime is proportional to the length of the time window. For advection dominated problems, the convergence rate is initially linear and it improves as the the ratio of advection to diffusion increases. Moreover, it is independent of the size of the time window and of the number of subdomains. In two space dimensions, the iteration possesses the smoothing property: high modes of the error are damped much faster then low modes. This is a result of the natural smoothing property of the heat equation. Numerical calculations illustrate our analysis.

Reference-contexts: The numerical implementation of this iteration is closely related to the waveform-relaxation method, for the solution of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [1]-[15]. Specifically, space-time DD is equivalent to a block waveform-relaxation method with overlapping splittings, applied to the semi-discretized parabolic equation. Jeltsch and Pohl <ref> [16] </ref> extended the theory of waveform relaxation to the case of overlapping splittings. They showed that the rate of convergence is superlinear, in a finite time window. <p> and it is valid for k a=(4fl) + 1 when fl &gt; 0 with B (k) = 1 + 4 a : (94) Inequality (91) follows from the bound (92), in view of Lemma 5. 2 The analysis of the semi-discrete iteration by the theory of waveform relaxation and multisplitting <ref> [16] </ref>, yields the following bound for the decay of the error in the iteration k e k k t O (CT ) k ! 1 k ; k ! 1: (95) Here, the constant C deteriorates as the mesh parameter decreases to 0, in view of the stiff nature of the

Reference-contexts: It is independent of the number of subdomains, provided the size of the overlap between subdomains remains fixed. Gander and Stuart <ref> [17] </ref> analyzed domain decomposition as a form of waveform relaxation, for the one dimensional heat equation, on the infinite time interval. They found that convergence is linear and that the rate deteriorates as the number of subdomains increases. <p> We derive lower and upper bounds for the error that decay at a linear rate. The lower bound is valid for a finite number of iterations, and both bounds become arbitrarily close as T ! 1. The upper bound agrees with the result of Gander and Stewart <ref> [17] </ref> for the infinite time window. Theorem 3 Consider the space-time DD iteration for the one dimensional heat equation (20) in [x 0 ; x N+1 ] fi [0; T ] with N + 1 = 2; 3 subdomains. Suppose the initial error satisfies assumption (128).
