Abstract: up the command hierarchy, we would expect that the frequency of the messages will decrease and the length of the message will increase, placing less emphasis on reactivity and interruptibility and more emphasis on the process of interpreting and generating messages. John E. Laird is an associate professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Michigan. He received his B.S. degree in Computer and Communication Sciences from the University of Michigan in 1975 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1978 and 1983, respectively. His interests are centered on creating integrated intelligent agents (using the Soar architecture), leading to research in problem solving, complex behavior representation, machine learning, cognitive modeling.
