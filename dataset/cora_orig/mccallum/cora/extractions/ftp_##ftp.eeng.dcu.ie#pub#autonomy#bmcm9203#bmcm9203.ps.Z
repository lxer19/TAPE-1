Reference-contexts: Dawkins (1976, pp. 36-37) 26 Dawkins' argument for the inadmissibility of organisms (and, indeed, genomes and chromosomes too) even as candidate D-actors, in sexually reproducing species, seems straightforward enough at first sight. We first accept that there is significant standing genetic heterogeneity in natural populations <ref> (e.g. Ayala 1978) </ref>. It follows that, with overwhelming probability, every organism will be genetically unique. If we S-classify simply on this basis, then no coherent S-lineages can form (since no offspring will match the S-class of either parent, so no S-descent will occur), and selection cannot take place.

Reference-contexts: Dawkins (1976, p. 18) He goes on to argue that there would be an overall trend toward the evolution of "va-rieties" (classes or lineages?) of replicator with high "longevity/fecundity/copying-fidelity" <ref> (Dawkins 1976, p. 19) </ref>. 1 Henceforth, I shall call this first form of longevity A-longevity, for actor-longevity. Somewhat later in the same source, Dawkins specifies that "Copying fidelity is another way of saying longevity-in-the-form-of-copies and I shall abbreviate this simply to longevity" (Dawkins 1976, p. 30, emphasis added). <p> Somewhat later in the same source, Dawkins specifies that "Copying fidelity is another way of saying longevity-in-the-form-of-copies and I shall abbreviate this simply to longevity" <ref> (Dawkins 1976, p. 30, emphasis added) </ref>. Now this version of longevity evidently refers to a replicator viewed as a lineage ("in-the-form-of-copies"), or L-replicator. Henceforth, I shall call this L-longevity, for lineage-longevity. <p> The interpretation Hull gives here is not the "correct" one|i.e. that which accompanied the original formulation of the slogan in <ref> (Dawkins 1976, p. 19) </ref>, and which referred to A-replicators|but the confusing and redundant one which refers to L-replicators (Dawkins 1976, p. 30; 1978a, p. 68). <p> Thus, in a final version of the rowing analogy, he could conclude only that he found it more "parsimo-nious" to think of the coach selecting at the level of the independent candidates rather than whole crews <ref> (Dawkins 1976, p. 92) </ref>. On the face of it this is a substantive retreat from his original claim that only genes could qualify as D-actors, under sexual reproduction. Even this is not the final conclusion however. <p> It is excerpted from a longer discussion, in which Dawkins compares genes (or, more generally, repli-cators) to computer programs, saying inter alia that a program "is not fussy which physical computer it uses to act out its skills" <ref> (Dawkins 1976, p. 55) </ref>. This is, of course, true as far as it goes, but could easily be read as meaning that computer programs have intrinsic or absolute interpretations, which are merely realised by plugging them into any (arbitrary) computer.

Reference-contexts: Hull also uses Dawkins' slogan "longevity, fecundity and fidelity" in another paper Hull (1980, p. 317), but, on this occasion, citing only <ref> (Dawkins 1978a) </ref> as the source. Again, Hull goes on to specify that the "relevant longevity concerns the retention of structure through descent" (i.e. L-longevity). <p> The problem is further compounded by Dawkins (1982a, p. 84) where he quotes, at length, from (Hull 1980), and specifically endorses Hull's interpretation of longevity in this context|thus reinforcing the confusion he himself originated in <ref> (Dawkins 1978a) </ref>. I should point out that, although Hull may have been led astray by Dawkins on the use of the term longevity, as such, he also quite independently originated a related confusion himself. <p> rival can-14 Note, again, that this distinction is not related to the relative merits of S-lineages versus D-actors as the "unit of selection", but is purely about the relative merits of two candidate D-actors. 33 didates for the role of A-replicators Dawkins accepted that certain organisms could play this part <ref> (Dawkins 1978a, p. 69) </ref>. 15 At this point, while he had defined replication in terms of copying, he was placing no particular stress on this fact; in effect, his replicator was still more or less synonymous with my D-actor, requiring only similarity and descent to characterise it.

Reference: <author> Dawkins, Richard. </author> <year> 1982a. </year> <note> The Extended Phenotype. </note>
Reference-contexts: As far as I am aware, the abstract, technical, idea of a replicator was first introduced by Dawkins (1976; 1978a). Hull subsequently elaborated the idea (Hull 1980; 1981), and Dawkins has since extended his own analysis somewhat further <ref> (Dawkins 1982a) </ref>. I shall generally be relying on these sources in the discussion which follows. <p> we must be talking about L-rep-licators.] Dawkins (1982a, p. 83) This confusion between A-replicator and L-rep-licator is counterpointed (presumably with unconscious irony) by Dawkins' approving remark, that Hull (1980; 1981) is "particularly clear about the logical status of the lineage, and about its distinction from the replicator and the interactor" <ref> (Dawkins 1982a, p. 100) </ref>. In conclusion: the objective of this section has been simply to establish that, though Dawkins and Hull make considerable use of the term replicator, their usage is quite generally ambiguous as between A-replicator and L-replicator, and calls for very careful interpretation. <p> This is what I call genetic absolutism (for terminology, compare Bateson's "absolute genetic unit"|see Bateson 1986, p. 82). Genetic absolutism is closely related to, but should be very clearly distinguished from, genetic determinism <ref> (see, for example, Dawkins 1982a, Chapter 2) </ref>. Genetic absolutism does not require that the effects of genomes (much less individual genes) be deterministic, only that they exhibit "regularities"; these regularities can be purely statistical. That is, genetic absolutism is perfectly consistent with a stochastic or probabilistic indeterminism. <p> For example, it is a commonplace assumption that evolutionary descent is theoretically reversible <ref> (e.g. Dawkins 1982a, p. 3) </ref>, although such reversal is of vanishingly small probability over any significant number of steps (this is known as "Dollo's Law"|Dawkins 1986, p. 94); but this ignores the essential relativity involved in genotypic expression. <p> This point must be empha-sised because it has not been recognised by Hull, and Dawkins has actively suggested that the opposite is the case|that they are both presenting similar answers to the same question <ref> (Dawkins 1982a, pp. 82-83) </ref>. But to return to the issue at hand: the fact that Dawkins intends gene, or replicator, as a lineage rather than an actor still leaves open the question of whether he means S-lineage as such (and not any other kind of lineage). <p> Indeed, Dawkins explicitly and favourably quotes Hull's distinction between similarity and descent (as also quoted in section 6 above), and the need for both to be present <ref> (Dawkins 1982a, p. 84) </ref>. Fourthly, in distinguishing active and passive A-replicators Dawkins introduces something essentially equivalent to Hull's distinction between replication and interaction. <p> He has not given any extended or detailed analysis, as far as I am aware, but he seems to consider that their two versions of "replicator" are equivalent, and he explicitly equates Hull's "interactor" with a kind of entity he now terms a vehicle <ref> (Dawkins 1982a, p. 100) </ref>. I will consider the Dawkinsian "vehicle" concept in somewhat more detail below; for the moment it is sufficient to record my disagreement with Dawkins on these points. <p> Hull requires that parent and offspring be similar enough "to respond similarly to similar selection pressures" (Hull 1980, p. 321); Dawkins expresses himself in essentially the same terms <ref> (Dawkins 1982a, p. 89) </ref>. <p> Dawkins is certainly aware of this paper, having cited it in, for example, <ref> (Dawkins 1982a) </ref> and (Dawkins 1983). <p> By contrast, Dawkins seems to hold that such concurrent selection of a co-dependent set can arise only if disruption through recombination can be neglected|which is to say, "only if the genes . . . were linked tightly in a supergene" <ref> (Dawkins 1982a, p. 244) </ref>. This, of course, would effectively mean a return to the gene's eye view, except now in terms of a "super-gene". Dawkins seems to be implicitly denying that the shifting balance process can be effective|but without giving specific arguments as to why not. <p> He is perhaps even more explicit in a more or less parenthetical discussion in The Extended Phenotype, where he essentially claims that if a genetic change is reversed the phenotypic consequences will necessarily be reversed also <ref> (Dawkins 1982a, pp. 3-4) </ref>; but, as already commented upon in section 5.4, this conclusion would seem to be warranted only under an assumption of genetic absolutism. In any case, my objective here has simply been to establish that Dawkins can reasonably be interpreted as espousing genetic absolutism.

Reference-contexts: However, Dawkins subsequently changed his mind, deciding that nothing more inclusive than the "genome" could ever operate as an A-replicator <ref> (Dawkins 1982b, p. 50) </ref>. This applied to organisms as such (whether sexual or asexual), and generally to any more inclusive entities.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, a primary objective in building up the 3 abstract formalism of the D-system was precisely to allow this insight of Dawkins' to be expressed in the clearest possible terms. While Dawkins himself credits Fisher, Hamilton, G.C. Williams and others, with the original inspiration <ref> (Dawkins 1989b, p. ix) </ref>, I may say that my own debt here is entirely to Dawkins. <p> Dawkins has taken the opportunity of a new edition of The Selfish Gene to respond to this and similar criticism by quoting, at length, from the original edition, his repeated rejection of any such "genetic atomism", <ref> (Dawkins 1989b, pp. 271-2) </ref>. Dawkins argues, correctly in my view, that interaction between genetic loci in their correlation with phenotypic effects does not, in itself, undermine his analysis in the slightest. I suggest that Gould actually had the correct idea here, but it unfortunately got fatally sidetracked.

Reference-contexts: We must now enquire as to the dynamic relationships between these S-lineages, and, in particular, whether any will compete in such a way as to result in selection. That is, we consider whether selection can or will occur within a single interbreeding population <ref> (which I call phyletic selection, following Eldredge & Gould 1972) </ref>. The general answer is that these dynamic relationships may be very complicated, and will not generally realise any simple form of selection. However, we can distinguish some special cases where phyletic selection, as such, may arise.

Reference-contexts: So far, this is similar to Hull's discussion. However, Eldredge and Gould have gone further than this, and have argued that speciation events might be "essentially random" with respect to long term evolutionary changes <ref> (Gould & El-dredge 1977) </ref>, an idea they attribute (perhaps misleadingly) to Sewall Wright.

Reference-contexts: However, the "modifi-cation" in question now amounts to a thorough rebuilding of the existing phenotype, and could not conceivably arise by a process of unjustified variation <ref> (compare the more detailed discussion in Hofstadter 1985, Chapter 27) </ref>. Thus, I happily stipulate that the only modifications which need be practically considered in a properly Darwinian evolutionary process are just those which Dawkins calls genetic. 34 in reproduction) in order to "stabilise" the preservation of S-class in S-descent.

Reference-contexts: Hull considers this distinction to be of critical importance; he goes as far as to say that "A pervasive ambiguity in the literature on levels of selection can be eliminated by consistently distinguishing between replication and interaction" <ref> (Hull 1981, pp. 33-4) </ref>. <p> sexual reproduction between genetically heterogenous organisms, Hull states that "Dawkins would argue that only those segments of the genetic material which remained undisturbed can count as replicators, while I see no reason not to consider the organisms themselves replicators if the parents and offspring are sufficiently similar to each other" <ref> (Hull 1981, p. 34) </ref>; this is in the context of an earlier interpretation of "similar enough" as meaning to "react similarly to similar selection pressures" (Hull 1981, pp. 32-33). <p> as replicators, while I see no reason not to consider the organisms themselves replicators if the parents and offspring are sufficiently similar to each other" (Hull 1981, p. 34); this is in the context of an earlier interpretation of "similar enough" as meaning to "react similarly to similar selection pressures" <ref> (Hull 1981, pp. 32-33) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: But certainly, if I have succeeded in making any worthwhile contribution at all, it is only because I have been able to build on the insights which Hull and Dawkins had already carved out. 2 Terminology This section provides a short summary of terminology introduced in <ref> (McMullin 1992a) </ref>; please consult that essay for more detailed discussions. Very briefly, actors are individuals which reproduce, with some degree of heritability. A Similarity-lineage or S-lineage is a lineage of actors which includes, at each generation, only those offspring which are "similar" to their parent (s) in some specified way. <p> I have already considered this question at some length <ref> (McMullin 1992a, Section 11) </ref>. I accepted Dawkins' particular formulation of this question ("The central theoretical problem of teleonomy will be that of the nature of the entity for whose benefit adaptations may be said to exist"|Dawkins 1982a, p. 81). <p> I claim that this was the interpretation Dawkins properly had in mind when he formulated the doctrine of the The Selfish Gene; that, indeed, it is identical with my doctrine of the "selfish S-lineage" <ref> (McMullin 1992a, Section 11) </ref>. The second question at issue is quite different: 2: Is there a uniquely distinguished "level" of or ganisation (biological or otherwise) which char-acterises entities that can qualify as D-actors? I suggest that this is the question which Hull set out to answer. <p> See, for example, the so-called quasi-species of Eigen & Schuster (1979) for a particular illustrative example of this process actually applied to a D-system; but compare also my comments in <ref> (McMullin 1992a, Section 6.5) </ref>. place each other in suitable circumstances|i.e. that organisms, at least, can be validly regarded as D-actors in the solution of P d . <p> the offspring, and, as a matter of empirical 9 This definition of "similarity" is essentially equivalent to the notion of "S-classification", and the condition stated here for regarding an entity as a Hullean replicator is equivalent to the definition of S-descent as a case of descent preserving a particular S-class <ref> (McMullin 1992a, Section 5) </ref>. fact, such properties are not so preserved. 10 On a criterion of strict "identity" we should have to conclude than not even fragments of DNA (embedded in biological organisms)|which are the very paradigmatic cases for both Hull and Dawkins|qualify as "replicators". <p> This, of course, is the stage in my own formulation where I introduce the ideas of S-fecundity and S-mortality (then leading on to S-value) of an S-lineage, and stipulate that these should be "reasonably" determinate functions of the S-class (and the environment|the latter possibly including other S-lineages, of course)|see <ref> (McMullin 1992a, Section 6.1) </ref>. Without this correlation between S-class and S-value we cannot possibly have a selective dynamics. <p> In my own formulation of the (D-)actor, this distinction is implicit in my discussion of the requirement that (for selection to occur) S-class must be "predictive" of S-value; but, like Hull, I do not introduce a separate term to explicitly distinguish such S-classes <ref> (McMullin 1992a, esp. Sections 6.1 and 6.4) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: So, on this view, genes have no decisive merits as D-actors; but, equally, neither have they any special disadvantages. However, even this is not the case for the shifting balance model of (phyletic) evolution, due to Sewall Wright. This model was originally formulated in the 1920's <ref> (Provine 1986) </ref>, but Wright has continued to develop and elaborate the theory since|see (Wright 1982) for a recent review. In this model, 6 significant events of phyletic selection can relate to S-classes which are distinguished at more than a single (Mendelian) genetic locus.

Reference-contexts: That is, under shifting balance, genomes or organisms actually provide a significantly simpler (and thus preferable) formal description of selection, as compared to a gene level description. 13 Wright has presented essentially this criticism of genic selectionism, as a specific response to Dawkins, in his paper Genic and Organismic Selectionism <ref> (Wright 1980) </ref>. Dawkins is certainly aware of this paper, having cited it in, for example, (Dawkins 1982a) and (Dawkins 1983).

Roughly speaking, Wright suggests the possibility that genome or organism S-lineages, distinguished from each other (S-classified) by differences at multiple genetic loci, may selectively displace each other|and, indeed, that this may be the predominant process in phyletic evolution.
