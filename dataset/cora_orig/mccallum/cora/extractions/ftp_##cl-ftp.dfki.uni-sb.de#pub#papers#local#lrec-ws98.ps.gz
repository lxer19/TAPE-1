Abstract: This paper describes two distinct evaluation initiatives on the NLP performance of smes (Saarbrucker Message Extraction System). The first study aimed at the improvement of smes used as analysis component of a German dialogue system for appointment scheduling. While the first scenario was mainly designed to test the overall analysis result, the second is concerned with a systematic evaluation of the NLP components of the core engine of the smes system. The morphological analysis, the disambiguation ability of the POS tagger as well as one of the various parsing modules are now under evaluation. Suitable reference material and supporting evaluation tools are being developed in parallel.

Reference-contexts: In the context of the evaluation of the parsing module, the profound examination of the morphological component MORPHIX++ and the recently integrated POS tagger (an adapted version of the BRILL tag-ger <ref> (Brill 1995) </ref>) was necessary for two reasons: Firstly, it is important to detect and eliminate processing deficiencies which could influence the subsequent syntactic analysis. Secondly, the results of these NLP components must be reliable in order to support efficient semi-automatic annotation of the required reference material for smes.

Reference-contexts: prototype of smes consisted of: * a tokenizer based on regular expressions, which scans the input to identify the fragment patterns (e.g. words, date expressions, etc.); * MORPHIX++ 3 , an efficient and robust German morphology component which performs morphological inflection and compound processing; 3 MORPHIX++ is based on MORPHIX <ref> (Finkler and Neumann 1988) </ref>. * a shallow parsing module consisting of a declarative specification tool for expressing finite state grammars; * a linguistic knowledge base which includes a lexicon of about 120,000 lexical root entries; * an output presentation component where fragment combination patterns are used for defining linguis tically oriented

Reference-contexts: For the application domain a set of automata was designed for typical verbs and various kinds of temporal expressions used in appointment scheduling negotiations. 3.1. Evaluation Experiment The evaluation of smes in this setting aimed at the improvement of the syntactic analysis of the smes prototype for appointment scheduling <ref> (Klein et al. 1997) </ref>. For the determination and extension of the linguistic coverage of smes a database system containing 160 carefully selected e-mail messages was developed.

Reference-contexts: Currently the methodology for the systematic testing of the shallow parsing component is being designed. In addition to the corpus-based evaluation on the smes reference material, the various modules of the syntax component will be evaluated on the basis of linguistic competence data partly taken from the TSNLP <ref> (Lehmann et al. 1996) </ref> and DiET (Netter et al. 1998) test suites. The improved parser output will be employed for the semiautomatic syntactic annotation of the reference corpus. 2. <p> For the determination and extension of the linguistic coverage of smes a database system containing 160 carefully selected e-mail messages was developed. Based on the TSNLP 4 guidelines for the annotation of test material for NLP systems <ref> (Lehmann et al. 1996) </ref>, 240 e-mail fragments were assigned structural information and application-specific annotations relevant especially for temporal expressions.

Reference-contexts: This paper reports on two independent evaluations on the NLP performance of the smes system (Saarbr ucker Message Extraction System), developed at the DFKI <ref> (Neumann, et al. 1997) </ref>. It is important to note that the evaluation was not concerned with the application-specific abilities of smes, i.e. its performance on the correct and efficient extraction of information but only with its language processing functionalities. <p> The improved parser output will be employed for the semiautomatic syntactic annotation of the reference corpus. 2. SMES Saarbr ucker Message Extraction System The smes system <ref> (Neumann et al. 1997) </ref> combines a core machinery for shallow processing and a user-defined system of finite state automata defining the grammar.
