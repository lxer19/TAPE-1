Abstract: One of the most important parameters to consider when designing a manipulator is the number of degrees-of-freedom (DOFs). This article focuses on the question: How many DOFs are necessary and sufficient for fault tolerance and how should these DOFs be distributed along the length of the manipulator? A manipulator is fault tolerant if it can complete its task even when one of its joints fails and is immobilized. The number of degrees-of-freedom needed for fault tolerance strongly depends on the knowledge available about the task. In this article, two approaches are explored. First, for the design of a General Purpose Fault Tolerant Manipulator, it is assumed that neither the exact task trajectory, nor the redundancy resolution algorithm are known a priori and that the manipulator has no joint limits. In this case, two redundant DOFs are necessary and sufficient to sustain one joint failure as is demonstrated in two design templates for spatial fault tolerant manipulators. In a second approach, both the Cartesian task path and the redundancy resolution algorithm are assumed to be known. The design of such a Task Specific Fault Tolerant Manipulator requires only one degree-of-redundancy.

Reference-contexts: Design of fault tolerant robots, 2. Fault detection and identification (FDI), 3. Fault recovery and intelligent control. When designing a fault tolerant manipulator, one should decide where to include redundancy so that the overall reliability is maximum. One should distinguish between hardware, software, analytical, information, and time redundancy <ref> (Johnson 1989) </ref>. Our focus will be on hardware redundancy, which consists of actuation, sensor, communication and computing redundancy. Each of these types of redundancies can still be implemented at different levels. <p> The underlying assumption is that a manipulator that can sustain a joint failure is more reliable than one that cannot. The question is: Does fault tolerance always result in an increase in reliability? The answer is given by reliability theory <ref> (Johnson 1989) </ref>. The reliability, , of a component or a system is the conditional probability that the component operates correctly throughout the interval , given that it was operating correctly at the time .

Reference-contexts: It is shown that the chances for task completion, after immobilization of one joint due to failure, are much better than when traditional pseudo-inverse control is used. However, due to the local nature of the fault tolerance measure, completion of the task cannot be guaranteed on a global scale <ref> (Lewis and Maciejewski 1994b) </ref>. An important conclusion is that the ability to recover from a fault depends strongly on the joint trajectory followed by the fault-free manipulator system. This conclusion led us to explore two approaches to the problem of manipulator fault tolerance.

Reference-contexts: The transition to operation with one fewer DOF can simply be achieved by zeroing out the column of the Jacobian that corresponds to the immobilized DOF. The gradient projection method <ref> (Ligeois 1977) </ref> can be used to assure that the manipulator stays within the fault tolerant joint intervals, indicated in Figure 13. By choosing an appropriate potential function, , one can even combine the requirement for fault tolerance with a secondary task requirement.

Reference-contexts: RMMS utilizes a stock of interchangeable link modules of different lengths and shapes, and joint modules of various sizes and performance specifications. By combining these general purpose modules, a wide range of manipulator configurations can be assembled. When one needs a different configurations for a specific task <ref> (Paredis, and Khosla 1993) </ref>, a robot created with the RMMS can be easily taken apart and reconfigured suitably. This reconfigurability can be further exploited to reduce the complexity of fault tolerant manipulators, as is shown in Section 4.

Reference-contexts: Space applications are particularly vulnerable to failure, because of the adverse environment (cosmic rays, solar particles etc.) and the demand for long term operation. In this context, NASA has started to incorporate fault tolerance in their robot designs <ref> (Wu et al. 1993) </ref>. Reliability is also 2 Christiaan J.J. Paredis and Pradeep K.
