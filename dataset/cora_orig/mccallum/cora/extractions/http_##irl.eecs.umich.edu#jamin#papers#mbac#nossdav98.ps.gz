Abstract: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is considering the adoption of controlled-load service as a standard for relaxed real-time service on the Internet. The ability of relaxed real-time services to achieve high level of utilization and still provide acceptable quality of service depends crucially on the use of measurement-based admission control (MBAC) algorithms. MBAC algorithms admit new connections based on measured usage of existing ones. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of an MBAC algorithm for controlled-load service on a router running FreeBSD 2.2.2 kernel. We then present an end-to-end evaluation which shows that controlled-load service, supported by an MBAC, reduces the packet loss rate and delay variation of real-time traffic while maintaining network efficiency.

Reference-contexts: While it has been largely accepted that real-time applications on the Internet must adapt to available bandwidth <ref> [AMK97] </ref>, and adjust their quality accordingly, efforts to quantify the effect of network congestion on user-perceived quality has seen limited results. The authors of [MKT95, RKTS94] studied the design of adaptive algorithms given a packet stream with varying inter-arrival times. <p> It has become widely accepted that good programming practices of real-time Internet applications should incorporate some form of adaptive playback <ref> [AMK97] </ref>. The adaptive nature of such applications makes the specification of a metric to quantify the effect of network congestion on their performance that much harder to define. In 2 [BBS98], the authors compute the utility function of adaptive applications as a function of delay variation.

Reference-contexts: We also observe that the loss rate of BE traffic under MACE is not significantly worse than the loss rate of BE traffic without MACE. We expect real-time audio and video traffic on the Internet to be better modeled by traffic with ON/OFF times instead of CBR traffic <ref> [Flo96, GW94, BSTW95] </ref>. We conducted an experiment under the fourth scenario with mixed BE and CL traffics modeled by CBR 64 bkps, POO1, POO3, and EXP1 source models.

Researchers have observed LRD characteristic in Internet audio and video traffic <ref> [Flo96, GW94, BSTW95] </ref>. To see the effect of LRD, we use the POO1 model from the second scenario. We run an experiment from the second scenario and record flow arrival times and lifetimes of 20 CL connections.

Estimator. The estimator computes the average bandwidth usage. It periodically samples the counter maintained by the measurement unit. We use the same moving time window mechanism presented in [JSD97] to obtain a bandwidth usage estimate from bandwidth averages. This moving time window mechanism uses a fixed window size expressed in number of samples. The maximum bandwidth during each measurement window is recorded by the estimator. The bandwidth usage estimate is updated on three occasions.

Reference-contexts: The slow-down of interrupt handler causes more packets to be dropped at a busy router since the possibility of overrunning the Ethernet interface buffer is now higher. This is a well known problem of input-queueing <ref> [Kes97] </ref>. We also observed little input queueing at the IP level, hence we do not add CL service support at the input queue.

Real-time audio and video applications typically compute playback points based on individual packet delays <ref> [MKT95] </ref>. Large packet delay variations cause playback points to be postponed, resulting in loss of fidelity. Hence, one of the objectives in introducing CL service is to reduce the delay variations experienced by real-time audio and video traffic.
