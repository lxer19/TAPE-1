Title: Animation through Reactions, Transition Nets and Plans  for Human Modeling and Simulation  
Author: Bonnie Webber Norman Badler 
Affiliation: Center  Department of Computer Information Science University of Pennsylvania  
Abstract: We describe a framework for creating animated simulations of virtual human agents. The framework allows us to capture flexible patterns of activity, as well as reactivity to a changing environment. Both lead to variation in how an animated simulation will be realized. In addition, because different parts of an activity make different demands on an agent's resources and decision-making, our framework allows special-purpose reasoners and planners to be associated with only those phases of an activity where they are needed.

Reference-contexts: General purpose planning The function of general purpose planning is to expand high-level goals into a contextually appropriate structure of more basic actions. In Hide and Seek, general purpose planning is used to formulate and maintain a plan for satisfying a seeker's goal of finding a hider. ItPlanS <ref> (Geib95) </ref> is a hierarchical planner, in which hierarchical expansion of a plan structure to successively lower levels of abstraction only takes place to the degree necessary to determine the next action to be carried out. <p> The incremental nature of the resulting plan allows ItPlanS to make commitments at the appropriate level of detail for action while not committing itself to future actions that might be obviated by changes in the world. ItPlanS is described in more detail in <ref> (Geib95) </ref>. Search planning Since human agents have a limited field-of-view, they must search to find objects that are outside of it. We have isolated this reasoning in a specialized module, a search planner, that translates information acquisition goals to high-level physical goals to explore parts of the environment (Moor93).
