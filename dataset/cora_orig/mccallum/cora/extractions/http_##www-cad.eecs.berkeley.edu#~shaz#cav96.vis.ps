Reference-contexts: The combinational input variables are ordered by doing a depth-first traversal of the logic that generates the combinational outputs. The order in which the output logic cones are visited is determined using the algorithm of Aziz et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. This algorithm orders the latches to decrease a communication complexity bound (where backward edges are more expensive than forward edges) on the latch communication graph.

Reference-contexts: VIS has both an interactive command interface and a batch mode. For a detailed description of the full functionality of VIS, with examples of usage, refer to the VIS Manual <ref> [2] </ref>. Verilog front end VIS operates on an intermediate format called BLIF-MV, which is an extension of BLIF, the intermediate format for logic synthesis accepted by SIS [8]. VIS includes a stand-alone compiler from Verilog to BLIF-MV, called VL2MV [3], which supports a synthesizable subset of Verilog.

Reference-contexts: Verilog front end VIS operates on an intermediate format called BLIF-MV, which is an extension of BLIF, the intermediate format for logic synthesis accepted by SIS [8]. VIS includes a stand-alone compiler from Verilog to BLIF-MV, called VL2MV <ref> [3] </ref>, which supports a synthesizable subset of Verilog. VL2MV extracts a set of interacting finite state machines that preserves the behavior of the source Verilog program defined in terms of simulated results. Two new features have been added to Verilog: 1. Nondeterminism.

Reference-contexts: Simplification of the transition relation T (~x; ~u; ~y), by taking the generalized cofactor with respect to R k (~y) (we care only about the transitions to the set of states not reached thus far). Model checking and debugging We use the algorithms presented in <ref> [4] </ref> as the basis for fair CTL model checking and debugging. In addition, a special algorithm has been implemented to improve the efficiency of checking invariants. Also, a structural pruning technique is used to eliminate those parts of the network that cannot affect the formula being checked.

Reference-contexts: This makes it easy for other researchers to plug in their algorithms for performing a particular task, and then evaluate their algorithm within the context of VIS. Extensive user and programmer documentation exists for VIS. The creation of this documentation was aided by the tool ext <ref> [5] </ref>, which extracts documentation embedded in the source code. For each function, the programmer provides a synopsis and a complete description, and ext automatically extracts this information, along with the function name and argument types, into an HTML file that can be viewed on the World Wide Web.

Conf. on Computer-Aided Design, </booktitle> <pages> pages 38-41, </pages> <month> Nov. </month> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: The traversal of an output logic cone is done in such a way that the combinational inputs farthest from the outputs appear earlier in the ordering. We use the merging technique of Fujii et al. to handle those variables that appear in multiple cones of logic <ref> [6] </ref>. Next state variables are inserted into the variable ordering immediately after the corresponding present state variables. We have found that forcing corresponding present state and next state variables to remain adjacent to each other is usually beneficial.

Reference-contexts: In general, intermediate variables can be introduced to represent the functionality of a cluster of nodes in the original network. This flexibility allows very large designs to be represented and manipulated. Image/Pre-image computation Our image/pre-image computation technique is based on an early variable quantification heuristic <ref> [7] </ref>. The initialization process consists of creating a bit-level relation for the next state function of each latch in the network. These bit-level relations are then ordered to optimally exploit early quantification.
