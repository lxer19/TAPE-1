Abstract: We consider the use of video images as a possible resource for computer-based arthroscopic training. In particular we examine the feasibility of displaying images as a direct response to movements of an arthroscope made by the practising surgeon. We discuss the use of a 6-D locator device; the problems of space and speed with respect to storage and retrieval of images; and the difficulties associated with ensuring that sufficient and appropriate images are captured. We report on various experiments. Our tentative conclusion is that our approach provides a potentially cost-effective solution to certain training requirements for non-invasive surgery.

Reference-contexts: An alternative to the visual feedback from the physical model is computer-generated graphics feedback using state-of-the-art graphics and virtual reality techniques. This idea is being pursued by several research groups, for example with colonoscopy <ref> [Haritsis92] </ref>. However, as the developers report, many compromises of visual accuracy have to be made if real time animation of shaded images is to be achieved. It involves high investment in equipment and lengthy development of graphical models.
