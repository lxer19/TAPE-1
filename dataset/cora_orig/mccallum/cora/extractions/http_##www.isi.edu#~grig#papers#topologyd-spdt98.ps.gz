Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of topology-d, a service that estimates the state of networked resources by periodically computing the end-to-end latency and available bandwidth among them. Using its delay and bandwidth estimates, topology-d computes a fault tolerant, minimum-cost spanning tree connecting participating sites. We deployed topology-d on 27 Internet sites throughout the world and collected data for a period of two and a half months. The results of these wide-area experiments show that topology-d's estimates compare quite well with latency and bandwidth measurements from existing tools. We observe that the logical topologies computed by topology-d are consistent with current latency and bandwidth estimates. Topologies are also responsive to changes in network and server load, as well as in group membership.

Reference-contexts: Since these are end-to-end measurements, they capture both network and server load. Based on these estimates, topology-d computes a low-delay, high-bandwidth spanning tree with additional edges for fault-tolerance. Topologies are periodically re-computed to take into account network and server load dynamics. Topology-d evolved from the Harvest <ref> [1] </ref> replication service [9], whose goal was to minimize the network bandwidth and delay required to replicate broker archives used in Harvest. Motivated by the need of other network-aware applications, we have implemented the replicator's network estimation and topology computation tool as a stand-alone service we call topology-d.

Reference-contexts: Globus aims at enabling the deployment of high-performance, computing-intensive distributed applications by taking advantage of resources such as high-speed networks and supercomputers. The Globus Metacomputing Directory Service (MDS) <ref> [3] </ref> provides information about the current state of available resources. This information is used by the Resource Broker when scheduling resources for specific tasks. Topology-d's robustness and distributed group membership protocol made it an ideal candidate for the job.

Reference-contexts: They can be logged for future assessments of the network status. Alternatively, topology-d's data can be either directly consumed by applications or it can be periodically published in a directory service for consultation by interested third-parties. The latter approach is the one adopted in the Globus metacomputing infrastructure <ref> [4] </ref>. We give more details about topology-d's integration into Globus in Section 2. Other potential clients of our tool include replicated databases and distributed information dissemination services, such as the World Wide Web and Internet archives. We anticipate that other applications can also benefit from topology-d's services. <p> a list of so-called "landmarks" (important sites across the Internet, including DNS root servers, well-known FTP servers and popular WWW servers) and measuring the packet loss and network latency to each landmark. 2.2 Applications One current client of our tool is the resource broker used in the Globus metacomputing infrastructure <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: TReno measures the throughput of a given link independent of the particular TCP implementation on the end hosts. Topology-d and netperf, on the other hand, measure the throughput of an end host's particular TCP implementation since this is the performance perceived by applications running on that host. Pathchar <ref> [6] </ref> is a recently released tool which estimates bandwidth, delay, average queue and loss rate of every hop between a given source-destination pair of Internet hosts.

Reference-contexts: We limited the data collection period to one week; during these seven days, we ran ping and netperf every hour while running topology-d. Netperf <ref> [7] </ref> estimates the available network throughput by sending packets of configurable length over a configurable period of time (10 seconds by default). This bandwidth measuring technique yields more accurate estimates than topology-d.

It aims at accurately measuring the bulk transfer capacity of network links by implementing its own TCP algorithm with Selective Acknowledgements (SACK). TReno measures the throughput of a given link independent of the particular TCP implementation on the end hosts.

Reference-contexts: One other observation concerns the asymmetry of network paths. The fact that network links are generally asymmetric has been stated in <ref> [11] </ref> and is confirmed by our statistics. Discussion Topology-d was not designed to provide accurate network bandwidth and delay measurements, but an estimate of the state of the network and its resources.

Reference-contexts: Unlike NWS, topology-d was designed to adjust to group membership dynamics.

NWS collects data using netperf and then applies a set of forecasting methods, including mean-based, median-based, and autoregressive models.

Reference-contexts: Topology-d is now deployed at all the sites participating in the Globus project and it provides its network measurements to the MDS. We are currently looking at ways to customize the logical topology algorithm to make it more suitable for Globus. Smart clients <ref> [15] </ref>, which is part of the Berkeley NOW (Network Of Workstations) project, is another application that can benefit from topology-d's services. It was developed as a collection of Java applets and take a client-side approach to providing transparent access to multi-server Internet services such as HTTP and FTP.
