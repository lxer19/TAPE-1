Title: Approximating the Minimum-Degree Steiner Tree to within One of Optimal  
Author: Martin Furer Balaji Raghavachari 
Abstract: The problem of constructing a spanning tree for a graph G = (V; E) with n vertices whose maximal degree is the smallest among all spanning trees of G is considered. This problem is easily shown to be NP-hard. In the Steiner version of this problem, along with the input graph, a set of distinguished vertices D V is given. A minimum-degree Steiner tree is a tree of minimum degree which spans at least the set D. Iterative polynomial time approximation algorithms for the problems are given. The algorithms compute trees whose maximal degree is at most fl + 1, where fl is the degree of some optimal tree for the respective problems. Unless P = N P , this is the best bound achievable in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: Our result shows that the minimum-degree spanning tree problem is approximable within an additive term of one. The only other NP-hard problems which we know to have similar approximation properties are the edge coloring problem [16], [23] and the 3-coloring problem in planar graphs <ref> [1] </ref>, [15]. In this paper, we show that Win's result [24] implies that the inverse of the toughness is approximately equal to fl . We provide an approximation algorithm which runs in polynomial time and finds a spanning tree of degree at most fl + 1.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 4.2 shows that when the algorithm stops the degree of the resulting tree is within one from the optimal degree. Each phase of the algorithm can be implemented in nearly linear time using Tarjan's fast disjoint set union-find algorithm for maintaining connected components (e.g., see <ref> [9] </ref>). Therefore the entire algorithm runs in O (mnff (m; n) log n), where m is the number of edges and ff is the inverse Ackerman function. 5 The Steiner Problem The Steiner version of the MDST problem is as follows.

Reference-contexts: This problem is a generalization of the Hamil-tonian Path problem and is NP-hard. Let T fl be an optimal spanning tree, whose maximal degree is fl . We are interested in finding approximation algorithms for this problem which guarantee some nontrivial approximation quality. Furer and Raghavachari <ref> [11] </ref> have given a parallel approximation algorithm which produces a spanning tree of degree O ( fl log n). In that paper, the problem is reduced to that of computing a sequence of maximal matchings in some auxiliary graphs. <p> We need reliable networks of small maximal degree. Additionally, this problem is interesting in its own right. Recently there has been a flurry of activity on approximating various NP-complete problems [2], [3], [4], <ref> [11] </ref>, [18], [19], [22].

Reference-contexts: An approximation algorithm with a good performance guarantee for the MDST problem is useful in the computation of spanning trees in networks for non-critical broadcast. Solutions to the broadcast problem have mainly concentrated on how to complete the broadcasting as quickly as possible <ref> [13] </ref>. But there are instances like the distribution of mail and news on the Internet, in which the broadcast need not be executed on a priority basis. One of the parameters that different sites may want to reduce is the amount of work done by their site.

Reference-contexts: The toughness of a graph is the minimum ratio generated by a subset X fl which gives the largest number of components per vertex removed. Win <ref> [24] </ref> showed that if a graph has a toughness of at least 1 (k2) for k 3, then it has a spanning tree of degree at most k. <p> The only other NP-hard problems which we know to have similar approximation properties are the edge coloring problem [16], [23] and the 3-coloring problem in planar graphs [1], [15]. In this paper, we show that Win's result <ref> [24] </ref> implies that the inverse of the toughness is approximately equal to fl . We provide an approximation algorithm which runs in polynomial time and finds a spanning tree of degree at most fl + 1. <p> Since the inequality is independent of w 0 , it is true for all Steiner trees. As fl is the degree of some Steiner tree, we get fl d w+t1 Proof of Theorem 1.1. If o 1 fl 3 for fl 4, we can apply the result of Win <ref> [24] </ref> and deduce that G has a spanning tree of degree at most fl 1. This is a contradiction 3 because, by definition, G does not have a spanning tree of degree less than fl .
