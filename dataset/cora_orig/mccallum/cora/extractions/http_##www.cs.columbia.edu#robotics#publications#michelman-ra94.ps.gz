Abstract: This paper discusses the implementation of complex manipulation tasks with a dextrous hand. The approach used is to build a set of primitive manipulation functions and combine them to form complex tasks. Only fingertip, or precision, manipulations are considered. Each function performs a simple two-dimensional translation or rotation that can be generalized to work with objects of different sizes and using different grasping forces. Complex tasks are sequential combinations of the primitive functions. They are formed by analyzing the workspaces of the individual tasks and controlled by finite state machines. We present a number of examples, including a complex manipulationremoving the top of a child-proof medicine bottlethat incorporates different hybrid position/force specifications of the primitive functions of which it is composed. The work has been implemented with a robot hand system using a Utah-MIT hand.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a two-fingered grasp is seen to be adequate for grasp stability during the first part of the task. 3.2 Implementation results This task has been implemented with the Utah-MIT hand. The system used in described in Allen et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. For this experiment, the hand was not connected to a robot arm: only fingertip manipulations were used to turn and lift the bot-tletop.

Reference-contexts: The initial grasp configuration and approximate finger motions are part of the primitive manipulation function. A second reason for using primitive functions is that in reality there is a finite set of motions that a hand must perform. The biologist Bernard Campbell <ref> [2] </ref> has written that the human hand has 58 basic motions.

Reference-contexts: In fact, there are only two main patterns and two subsidiary patterns. (p. 75) The two basic patterns are those in which the primary object motion is caused by arm motion (power grasps) and those in which the object motion is caused by finger motion (precision grasps). Cutkosky <ref> [3] </ref> further developed a classification of grasps used by machinists and an expert system that could select a start grasp given a set of task criteria.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Demonstrations of the manipulation capabilities of dextrous robot hands have lagged behind the building of research hands. Several significant experiments have shown particular capabilities of robot hands. Okada [11] built a three-fingered hand and demonstrated several elementary manipulations with his hand (putting a nut on a bolt). Fearing <ref> [4] </ref> used a Stanford/JPL hand to twirl a small block. Starr [16] and Paetsch and von Wichert [13] have used Cartesian object stiffness control for parts alignment and peg-in-hole tasks. In our work, a functional set of manipulation primitives is defined.

Reference-contexts: It also may be desired to vary the grasping force (to increase the amount of torque applied to the top, for example). Task partitioning is used to control the grasping force easily. Normally, one finger (or virtual finger, Iberall <ref> [5] </ref>) remains rigid in the direction of the grasp and the opposing finger modulates the grasping force. Here the internal grasping forces are seen clearly from the equilibrium condition: f 0y = f 1y , where f 0y is the component of the thumb's contact force in the y direction.

Reference-contexts: Task partitioning was discussed in Michelman and Allen [9]. The individual fingers in a manipulation are given specific roles in a manipulation. The roles can often be described using C-surface specifications (Mason <ref> [6] </ref>) and implemented with a hybrid position/force controller (Raibert and Craig [15]). For example, suppose the task is to rotate a cylinder with two fingers.

Reference-contexts: Here the internal grasping forces are seen clearly from the equilibrium condition: f 0y = f 1y , where f 0y is the component of the thumb's contact force in the y direction. There are an infinite number of solutions for the internal grasping forces <ref> [7] </ref>, and the selection of internal grasping forces is an active area of research (for example, see Park and Starr [14]). By holding the position of one finger fixed in the grasping direction, it is possible to control the grasping forces by modulating the opposing finger's contact force.

Reference-contexts: Tests, such as guarded moves, are included at the ends of certain states. An important issue in combining elementary tasks is determining which tasks can be combined and what is the workspace for the combined task. This is described in Michelman <ref> [8] </ref>. This section discusses an example of a common task that uses complex specifications: removing the top of a childproof medicine bottle. The task uses two elementary tasks: log-roll to rotate the top followed by a translation in the z-direction to lift it. the bottle. <p> Errors larger than several millimeters in positioning the hand in the global coordinate system can cause slippage. 4 Discussion of results The system has been used to perform a number of experiments; particularly, removing a bottletop, replacing the top, and twirling similar to Fearing's experiments (see <ref> [8] </ref>). The use of hybrid position/force specifications for each finger with complex tasks allows for a straightforward way to implement tasks. Experiments that use a combination of several primitive functions illustrate several key properties of a system based on task primitives.
