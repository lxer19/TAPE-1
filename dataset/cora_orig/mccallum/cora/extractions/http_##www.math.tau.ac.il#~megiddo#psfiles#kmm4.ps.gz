Reference-contexts: Our research is motivated by the following questions: (i) Do conjugate direction and conjugate gradient methods (see, for example, Cohen <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> , Hestenes [ 4 ] , and Stoer [ 12 ] ) work as effectively as Newton's method for approximating the analytic center? (ii) Can these methods be utilized effectively in interior point algorithms, replacing Newton's method? Here we begin answering these questions.

Reference-contexts: int , we can define a norm over R n by k~k x = ~ T r 2 F (x)~ : (1) We use the norm kx !k ! to measure the distance from any x 2 P int to the analytic center ! as in the papers by Renegar <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> and Vaidya [ 15 ] . <p> The curve is called the central trajectory or the path of centers. Thus, if we numerically trace the central trajectory till gets sufficiently close to fl , then we obtain an approximate optimal solution of the linear program (Sonnevend [ 11 ] ).

(Theorem 3.2 of Renegar <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> ) If kv !k ! = * &lt; 1, then the point x fl = v r 2 F (v) 1 rF (v), generated by one Newton iteration for minimizing the potential function F at the point v, satisfies kx fl !k ! 1 * Vaidya [ 15 <p> Concluding remarks Our main theorem (Theorem 1.2) suggests a modification of Renegar's polynomial-time algorithm <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> for linear programs. Specifically, we can replace Newton's method, which is used to trace the central trajectory in Renegar's algorithm, by the Conjugate Direction Method. Such a modification does not, however, seem so attractive.
