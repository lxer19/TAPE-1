Abstract: Behavioral models of interest in software engineering all have equivalent computational power because they are all Turing-equivalent. They do not, however, all have equivalent modeling power. Modeling power is a matter of expressive efficiency, which is difficult to measure because of its subjectivity. One nonsubjective measure of modeling power compares models by investigating their representational succinctness. This paper investigates the modeling power of a newly proposed behavioral model, called state nets. The paper presents state nets, shows how the succinctness concept of modeling power can be useful in comparing new models with existing ones, and, as an example, proves that state nets have more modeling power than Petri nets. A model M1 is considered to have more modeling power than a model M2 if M1 uniformly represents the same information as M2 in a more succinct form. Although succinctness must be balanced by readability and understandability (e.g., Gdel numbering is not an ideal approach in practice), Peterson's measure of expressive power does provide insight in comparing behavioral models. Several behavioral models are commonly used in software engineering, including decision tables [Mor 82], finitestate machines, PAISLey [Zav 82], Petri nets [Pet 81], statecharts [Har 87], and others [Dav 90]. From among these, we choose Petri nets as a representative comparison model. We do so because Petri nets are widely used, formally defined, and basically address the same problems and issues as state nets. Like state nets, Petri nets are used to model concurrent systems in software engineering, (see for example its sample use to solve the Dining-Philosophers problem [Pet 81]). Keywords: behavioral models, modeling power, succinctness measures, objectoriented behavioral models, state nets, Petri nets. Our purpose, in this paper, is threefold: 1) introduce state nets as a new and promising objectoriented behavioral model, 2) show how Peterson's notion of modeling power can be used to make comparisons between behavioral models, and 3) prove that basic state nets have more modeling power than extended Petri nets.
