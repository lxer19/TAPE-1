Abstract: This paper presents an efficient approach to perform global interconnect sizing and spacing (GISS) for multiple nets to minimize interconnect delays with consideration of coupling capacitance, in addition to area and fringing capacitances. We introduce the formulation of symmetric and asymmetric wire sizing and spacing. We prove two important results on the symmetric and asymmetric effective-fringing properties which lead to a very effective bound computation algorithm to compute the upper and lower bounds of the optimal wire sizing and spacing solution for all nets under consideration. Our experiments show that in most cases the upper and lower bounds meet quickly after a few iterations and we actually obtain the optimal solution. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of global wire sizing and spacing for multiple nets with consideration of coupling capacitance. Experimental results show that our GISS solutions lead to substantial delay reduction than existing single net wire-sizing solutions without consideration of coupling capacitance.

Most early works used Elmore delay model [2] for interconnects and study the discrete wire sizing [1, 3, 4] and continuous wire shaping or sizing [5, 6]. <p> 1. INTRODUCTION Since the formulation of the optimal wire-sizing problem [1], there have been extensive studies in recent years on optimal wire-sizing algorithm. Most early works used Elmore delay model [2] for interconnects and study the discrete wire sizing <ref> [1, 3, 4] </ref> and continuous wire shaping or sizing [5, 6]. The wire-sizing problem is also studied under high-order delay model in [7, 8]. A comprehensive survey of these optimization techniques can be found in [9]. <p> m j g or an asymmet ric wire assignment W = fw E j 1 # 1 " 1 m j (w # m j E j )g for a routing tree of interest, say T j , in order to optimize the following weighted delay objective (as used in <ref> [1] </ref>) with consideration of the area, fringing and coupling capacitances: t T j (W) = k=1 j j where j k is the criticality of sink s j k in net N j , and k ; W) is the sink delay with wire-sizing solution W. <p> We model the routing tree of each net by an RC tree and use the distributed Elmore delay model [2] to measure the interconnect delays. The formulations used in this section are similar to those in <ref> [1] </ref>. For clarity of presentation, we assume that a uniform grid structure is superimposed on the routing plane, and each wire segment in the routing plane is divided into a sequence of wires of unit length. <p> Nonetheless, the results presented in this paper can be extended easily to the case where the wire segments are of non-uniform lengths in the same way as in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Note that we focus on the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of sink delays as in <ref> [1] </ref>. A previous work [10] showed that by assigning appropriate criticality/weight of each sink based on Lagrangian relaxation, the weighted-sum formulation can be used iteratively to meet the required arrival times. 2.3. <p> Extensions to more general 2D capacitance models will then be discussed. 4.1. Effective-Fringing Property: Theorems and Implications First, we consider the case of symmetric GISS. We define the dominance relation between symmetric wire-sizing solutions of a routing tree in the same way as in <ref> [1] </ref>: Definition 1 Symmetric Dominance Relation: Given two wire width assignments W and W 0 , let w E be the width assignment of edge E in W and w 0 E be the wire width of E in W 0 . <p> It suggests that the GISS algorithm actually have the capability to handle more general capacitance models. Further validation is planned as a future work. An alternative for computing lower and upper bounds is to use the local refinement method based on dominance property similar to those used in <ref> [1, 12, 15] </ref>. In particular, the GISS problem under variable c a and c f 's may be formulated as a general CH-posynomial program [15].
