Abstract: We present analytic expressions that approximate the behavior of the spacetime of a collapsing spherically symmetric scalar field in the critical regime first discovered by Choptuik. We find that the critical region of space-time can usefully be divided into a "quiescent" region and an "oscillatory" region, and a moving "transition edge" that separates the two regions. We find that in each region the critical solution can be well approximated by a flat spacetime scalar field solution. A qualitative nonlinear matching of the solutions across the edge yields the right order of magnitude for the oscillations of the discretely self-similar critical solution found by Choptuik.

Reference-contexts: Either a black hole forms or the scalar field energy eventually radiates away, leaving spacetime flat. By studying solutions very close to the critical case (formation of a black hole of vanishing mass) Choptuik <ref> [1] </ref> has found two very interesting phenomena, as yet not explained in any fundamental way: universality and echoing. Similarities to the Choptuik results have been found in other contexts. Abrahams and Evans [2] studied the collapse of axisymmetric vacuum gravitational fields. <p> This has been seen only in the work of Choptuik <ref> [1] </ref> and Abrahams and Evans [2] axially symmetric examples, in which the echoing occurred with a scaling factor around 6, rather than 30 as in Choptuik's spherically symmetric results. Very recently Gundlach [7], with an independent numerical approach, has confirmed that the echoing is an exact feature of the solution. <p> Having fixed the zero and the scale of our t coordinate, we next define the logarithmic coordinates ln r t ln (t) : (11) Notice that our choice of ff, and hence of t, differs from that of Choptuik <ref> [1] </ref> [he chooses ff (r = 1; t) = 1] but ; t defined in (11) agree with Choptuik's logarithmic coordinates ; t . at various late times t . These are data made available by Choptuik on the internet from his numerical evolutions.

For a perfectly critical solution, the solution studied by Gundlach <ref> [7] </ref>, the echoing would go through an infinite number of cycles. In all cases, the duration of proper time is finite, and is not highly sensitive to the way the sequence ends. <p> But equations (12) and (13) are valid only for a fixed numerical value 5 for , approximately 3.4 (a value of 3:4439 0:0004 according to Ref. <ref> [7] </ref>). For this reason the echoing property has been referred to as a "discrete self similarity." t . The scalar field variables X and Y have the appearance of being sinusoids approximately 150 degrees out of phase.
