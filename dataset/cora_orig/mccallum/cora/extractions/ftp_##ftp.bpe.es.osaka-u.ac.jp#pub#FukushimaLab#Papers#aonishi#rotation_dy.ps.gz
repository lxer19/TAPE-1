Abstract: Pattern recognition invariant to deformation or translation can be performed with the dynamic link architecture proposed by von der Malsburg. The dynamic link has been applied to some engineering examples efficiently, but has not yet been analyzed mathematically. We propose two models of the dynamic link architecture. Both models are mathematically tractable. The first model can perform matching between rotated images. The second model can also do that, and can additionally detect common parts in a template image and in a data image. To analyze these models mathematically, we reduce each model's equation to a phase equation, showing the mathematical principle behind the rotating invariant matching process. We also carry out computer simulations to verify the mathematical theories involved.

Reference-contexts: In this numerical simulation, we estimate the local minima of potential V versus various ranges of . For each point x 1 on the discretized ring F 1 , we assign to I 1 (x 1 ) random numbers with a uniform probability in <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. I 2 is set to the same value as I 1 . <p> I 2 is a noisy copy of I 1 , that is, I 2 (x 2 ) = I 1 (x 2 ) + ffn (x 2 ), where n (x 2 ) also takes any value in <ref> [1; 1] </ref> with a uniform probability. We use the local similarity 2.8 and apply the simulated annealing as before. 3 The second model 3.1 Model description functions defined on two rings F 1 and F 2 which are the same as the first model's. <p> Let I 1 (x 1 ) and I 2 (x 2 ) be 5-dimensional feature vectors. Each entry of these vectors is assigned a random value with a uniform probability in <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. Data in I 1 and I 2 are equivalent only in [0:6; 1:4], that is, 40% of the whole region of F 1 and F 2 . I 1 (x 1 ) and I 2 (x 2 ) are un-correlated elsewhere in the region.
