Abstract: Enterprise intranets are vulnerable not only to attacks from the Internet barbarians, but also to internal security breaches. Firewalling, typically used to control accesses to a trusted network from the Internet, is also an effective approach to secure enterprise intranets. Firewalling in traditional enterprise intranets is typically implemented as packet filtering routers sitting between different subnets to filter traffic between them. Such firewalling will not work in future ATM-based enterprise intranets that employs MPOA as the internetworking infrastructure. The reason is that in MPOA, cut-through connections intended for high-bandwidth and low-delay end-to-end communication will bypass such packet-filtering routers. So far there is no satisfactory solution to this problem. In this paper, we propose a firewalling scheme for MPOA, which is tight in security, low in cost, high in performance, and easy to manage. Based on the novel concept of "logical chokepoints", the proposed firewalling scheme does not require the existence of physical chokepoints inside the network to be secured. The proposed firewalling scheme is centrally managed so that it scales well to very large MPOA-based enterprise networks.

Reference-contexts: In this way, the functions of a router are distributed to MPOA servers and edge devices, which, by interacting through MPOA protocol, function as a distributed router <ref> [1] </ref>. The main justification to the approach is the cost. <p> Putting inexpensive functions on large number of 3 edge devices and expensive functions on a small number of MPOA servers makes MPOA extremely cost-effective <ref> [1] </ref>. Another justification is that centralized route processing facilitates centralized management. With the distributed router approach, only a small number of MPOA servers need to be configured and managed [11]. Cut-through connections allow direct inter-VLAN communication over an ATM network without requiring an intervening router.

Reference-contexts: However, the acceptance of ATM technology depends largely on its ability to interoperate with legacy LAN and WAN technology due to the huge past investment in the latter <ref> [2] </ref>. MPOA is proposed as a unified framework that allows MAC (Media Access Control) and internetwork layer protocols (e.g., IP, IPX, AppleTalk) be transparently transported over an ATM network [6]. In MPOA, ATM-attached LAN switches, called edge devices, are used to connect the legacy LAN segments to the ATM network.

Reference-contexts: To guard against attacks from the Internet, a packet-filtering firewall is typically deployed at the chokepoint between an enterprise network and the Internet to inspect the packets that travel between them <ref> [3] </ref>. Similarly, an enterprise intranet can be secured by placing packet-filtering firewalls at the chokepoints between departmental subnets. Such a firewalling scheme works well over traditional enterprise intranets where shared-media LANs, each of which is an IP subnet, are interconnected by IP routers.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Enterprise intranets are vulnerable not only to attacks from the Internet barbarians, but also to internal security breaches <ref> [4] </ref>. In an enterprise intranet, we would like to allow maximum sharing of information and resources within a departmental subnet while enforcing tight control over the cross-departmental network accesses.

Reference-contexts: In MPOA, ATM-attached LAN switches, called edge devices, are used to connect the legacy LAN segments to the ATM network. Edge devices implement LANE (LAN Emulation) protocol <ref> [5] </ref>, which, together with LANE-enabled ATM-attached hosts, provide a virtual LAN (VLAN) service, where ports on an edge device can be assigned to particular VLANs, independent of the physical location.

Reference-contexts: To authenticate the source end system, the MPOA server needs to search for key information and calculate authentication code such as signed digital signatures [14]. Relatively speaking, this is not an expensive function either. A high-performance cryptographic hardware is available at the price of 2000 dollars <ref> [7] </ref> each whereas a 12 full-fledged MPOA server costs at least 20000 dollars. Additionally, this tiny cost increase (about 10%) is further amortized by the large number of edge devices a MPOA server servers. Call screening functions of an edge device is completely embedded into its MPOA function as follows. <p> In MPOA servers, call screening decision making can be implemented efficiently using hashing techniques and strong authentication can be performed very fast using cryptographic hardware <ref> [7] </ref>. In edge devices, to perform call screening, table lookup is now based on both source address and destination address instead of destination address alone in a normal switch. However, with hashing techniques, the cost difference between them is virtually negligible.

Reference-contexts: The ingress edge device specifies in the signaling message the ATM address of the firewall switch as the final destination. The true destination is encoded into a user-to-user information element or generic identifier transport information element <ref> [8] </ref>. When this signaling message is forwarded to the firewall switch, the firewall switch knows the trick and will retrieve the final 14 destination from the corresponding information element and use it as the new destination to forward the signaling message.

Reference-contexts: Here, for ease of discussion, we assume that both the ingress edge device and the egress edge device are servered by the same MPOA server. In case they are servered by different MPOA servers, NHRP flow <ref> [9] </ref> between MPOA servers can be extended to synchronize information known to both MPOA servers. The MPOA protocol is extended as follows: 1.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, to filter packets over an ATM network, an ATM firewall device which operates at a high throughput and introduces low delay is called for. At the time of writing, one commercial ATM firewall product, StorageTek's ATLAS, is available <ref> [10] </ref>. ATLAS is a line filter that scans an ATM physical link to perform the packet-level filtering at OC-3c (155 Mbps) and will reach OC-12c (622 Mbps) in the near future. <p> Second, ATLAS uses a policy cache architecture <ref> [10] </ref> to dramatically speed up the process of deciding whether a packet header is safe or not. The core unit of this architecture is a cache block called policy cache.

Reference-contexts: Another justification is that centralized route processing facilitates centralized management. With the distributed router approach, only a small number of MPOA servers need to be configured and managed <ref> [11] </ref>. Cut-through connections allow direct inter-VLAN communication over an ATM network without requiring an intervening router. The flip side of the coin is that the traffic inside cut-through connections bypasses packet filtering firewalls if there are any. <p> Cut-through connections will lead to security breaches if they are not properly controlled. Two firewalling schemes for MPOA have been proposed, but none of them is satisfactory. One approach considered but later refuted by ATM forum is to let each edge device implement packet filtering function <ref> [11] </ref>. The approach was later refuted owing to its high cost. As discussed above, for MPOA to be cost-effective, edge devices have to be made inexpensive. <p> Moreover, for edge devices to perform packet filtering, complex configuration commands need either be programmed into each edge device or downloaded from MPOA servers using yet another new protocol <ref> [11] </ref>, which incurs high cost in system management and protocol development. The second approach, also proposed by ATM forum, argues that to equip MPOA servers with packet filtering capability, MPOA naturally provides a way to secure cut-through connections as follows. <p> An edge device allows the establishment of a cut-through 1 The only exception happens when the edge device receives a MPOA trigger from the MPOA server. 4 connection only when the first several packets of a flow withstand the scrutiny <ref> [11] </ref>. A problem with this approach is that it can not guard against the spoofing attack. For example, the source end system can first send some "benign" packets to the destination end system to simply fool the MPOA servers along the default path.

Reference-contexts: This involves the process of reassembling incoming cells into packets and disassembling outgoing packets into cells, which incurs a huge overhead. Second, the filtering bandwidth of a traditional firewall is generally below 100Mbps <ref> [12] </ref>, which is far less than the typical ATM rate of OC-3c (155 Mbps) and OC-12c (622 Mbps). Therefore, to filter packets over an ATM network, an ATM firewall device which operates at a high throughput and introduces low delay is called for.

Reference-contexts: The flip side of the coin is that the traffic inside cut-through connections bypasses packet filtering firewalls if there are any. Here we assume that each VLAN (or each group of VLANs) corresponds to a distinct security domain, which is in line with its purpose to create virtual workgroups <ref> [13] </ref>. Intra-VLAN communication is considered secure while inter-VLAN traffic needs inspection. Cut-through connections will lead to security breaches if they are not properly controlled. Two firewalling schemes for MPOA have been proposed, but none of them is satisfactory.

Reference-contexts: Second, if strong authentication is required for the source end system, the edge device needs also to obtain identity and key information of the end system and perform the authentication <ref> [14] </ref>. This task is too sophisticated for an edge device to handle. In the proposed firewalling scheme, the call screening decision is made by MPOA servers. <p> For call screening, the format of MPOA resolution request will be extended to contain the internetwork layer address of the source end system 2 as well. If strong authentication is needed to establish a cut-through connection, authentication information such as a signed digital signature <ref> [14] </ref> is also contained. 2. When MPOA server receives the MPOA resolution request, it makes the call screening decision according to the internetwork layer source and destination addresses contained in the MPOA resolution request. <p> This is obviously an inexpensive table lookup procedure. To authenticate the source end system, the MPOA server needs to search for key information and calculate authentication code such as signed digital signatures <ref> [14] </ref>. Relatively speaking, this is not an expensive function either. A high-performance cryptographic hardware is available at the price of 2000 dollars [7] each whereas a 12 full-fledged MPOA server costs at least 20000 dollars.

Additionally, since the number of such firewall switches is small, the cost will be amortized by the huge number of end systems they are able to protect.
