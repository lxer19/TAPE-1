Title: REPRESENTABILITY IS NOT DECIDABLE FOR FINITE RELATION ALGEBRAS  
Author: ROBIN HIRSCH AND IAN HODKINSON

Abstract: We prove that there is no algorithm that decides whether a finite relation algebra is representable. Representability of a finite relation algebra A is determined by playing a certain two player game G(A) over `atomic A-networks'. It can be shown that the second player in this game has a winning strategy if and only if A is representable. Let o be a finite set of square tiles, where each edge of each tile has a colour. Suppose o includes a special tile whose four edges are all the same colour, a colour not used by any other tile. The tiling problem we use is this: is it the case that for each tile T 2 o there is a tiling of the plane Zfi Zusing only tiles from o in which edge colours of adjacent tiles match and with T placed at (0; 0)? It is not hard to show that this problem is undecidable. From an instance of this tiling problem o we construct a finite relation algebra RA(o ) and show that the second player has a winning strategy in G(RA(o )) if and only if o is a yes-instance. This reduces the tiling problem to the representation problem and proves the latter's undecidability.

Reference-contexts: Maddux and McKenzie discussed it in the early 1980s, Maddux suggesting a solution by tiling (our approach here). It was raised again by McKenzie at a recent conference on universal algebra and lattice theory (Szeged, Hungary, 1996).

Reference-contexts: We call such an f a tiling. If there is no such tiling then we have a no-instance. 3 The tiling problem (given an instance, is it a yes-instance or a no-instance?) is known to be undecidable <ref> [Ber66] </ref>. It is not hard to show from this that the following problem is also undecidable.

To define RA (o ) it remains to define the operations of converse and composition on the atoms. The operations on arbitrary elements are then defined by distribution over disjunction: see <ref> [Lyn50] </ref>. For converse, we have already defined the converse of atoms with distinct subscripts. All the rest are self-converse except the following: the converse of +1 1 is 1 1 and the converse of +1 2 is 1 2 , and vice versa. Now we define composition. <p> We write 1 1 as an abbreviation for `either +1 1 or 1 1 '. We will refer to these inconsistent triangles by `rules 1 to 4'. All other triangles are defined to be consistent. This suffices to define composition. The resulting operation may not be associative (see <ref> [Lyn50, page 710] </ref>), but we will prove associativity later (lemma 7), in the case that is important to us. Note that 1 0 = e 0 + e 1 + e 2 follows from this definition of consistency.
