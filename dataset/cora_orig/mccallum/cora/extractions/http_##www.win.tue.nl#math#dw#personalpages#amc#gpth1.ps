Reference-contexts: Let g be an element of a group G. The order of hgi is called the order of g. It may be infinite. Exercise 1.2.13. Prove that a cyclic group is Abelian. Exercise 1.2.14. Consider the flat torus T . It can be seen as the square S = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1] with opposite edges glued together, such that the arrows in Figure 1.10 match. (Thus, the set is really in bijection with [0; 1) fi [0; 1).) The torus has the following group structure: given two points p = (p 1 ; p 2 ) and q <p> The order of hgi is called the order of g.

Reference-contexts: For two elements g; h in a group G we have (gh) 1 = h 1 g 1 , and (g n ) 1 = (g 1 ) n . For the latter we also write g n . This is very natural, as Weyl points out in <ref> [3] </ref>: `When you dress, it is not immaterial in which order you perform the operations; and when in dressing you start with the shirt and end up with the coat, then in undressing you observe the opposite order; first take off the coat and the shirt comes last.' Exercise 1.2.6.
