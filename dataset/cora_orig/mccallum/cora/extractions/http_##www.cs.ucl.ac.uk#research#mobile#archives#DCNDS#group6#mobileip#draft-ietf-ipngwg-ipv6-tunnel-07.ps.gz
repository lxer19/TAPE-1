Abstract: This document is an Internet Draft. Internet Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its Areas, and its Working Groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet Drafts. Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as a "working draft" or "work in progress." Abstract This document defines the model and generic mechanisms for IPv6 encapsulation of Internet packets, such as IPv6 and IPv4. The model and mechanisms can be applied to other protocol packets as well, such as AppleTalk, IPX, CLNP, or others.

Reference-contexts: The increase in the size of a tunnel IPv6 packet due to nested encapsulations may require fragmentation <ref> [RFC-1883] </ref> - see section 7. Furthermore, each fragmentation, due to nested encapsulation, of an already fragmented tunnel packet results in a doubling of the number of fragments. Moreover, it is probable that once this fragmentation begins, each new nested encapsulation results in yet additional fragmentation. <p> Conta & Deering Expires in six months [Page 13] INTERNET-DRAFT Tunneling in IPv6 December 16, 1996 4.1.1 Tunnel Encapsulation Limit The "Tunnel Encapsulation Limit" destination option is provided only by tunnel entry-point nodes, it is discarded only by tunnel exit point nodes, and it is used to carry optional information <ref> [RFC-1883] </ref> that need be examined only by tunnel entry-point nodes. <p> Type value 4 - the highest-order two bits - set to 00 - indicate "skip over this option if the option is not recognized". - the third-highest-order bit - set to 0 - indicates that the option data in this option does not change en route to the packet's destination <ref> [RFC-1883] </ref>. Opt Data Len value 1 - the data portion of the Option is one byte long. Opt Data Value the Tunnel Encapsulation Limit value - 8-bit unsigned integer. <p> It is decremented at each nested encapsulation of the packet. For a discussion of the excessive encapsulation risk factors in nested encapsulation see Appendix A. 5. Tunnel IPv6 Header The tunnel entry-point node fills out a tunnel IPv6 main header <ref> [RFC-1883] </ref> as follows: Version: value 6 Conta & Deering Expires in six months [Page 16] INTERNET-DRAFT Tunneling in IPv6 December 16, 1996 Priority: Depending on the entry-point node tunnel configuration, the priority can be set to that of either the original packet or a pre-configured value - see section 6.3. <p> The typical value is zero - see section 6.4. Payload Length: The original packet length, plus the length of the encapsulating (prepended) IPv6 extension headers, if any. Next header: The next header value according to <ref> [RFC-1883] </ref> from the Assigned Numbers RFC [RFC-1700 or its succesors ]. <p> December 16, 1996 6.7 IPv6 Tunnel MTU The tunnel MTU is set dynamically to the Path MTU between the tunnel entry-point and the tunnel exit-point nodes minus the size of the tunnel headers: the maximum size of a tunnel packet payload that can be sent through the tunnel without fragmentation <ref> [RFC-1883] </ref>. The tunnel entry-point node performs Path MTU discovery on the path between the tunnel entry-point and exit-point nodes [RFC-1981], [RFC-1885]. The tunnel MTU of a nested tunnel is the tunnel MTU of the outer tunnel minus the size of the tunnel headers.

Reference-contexts: If the Tunnel Encapsulation Limit is decremented to zero, the packet undergoing encapsulation is discarded. When the packet is discarded, a Parameter Problem ICMP message <ref> [RFC-1885] </ref> is returned to the packet originator, which is the previous tunnel entry-point. The message points to the Opt Data Value field within the Tunnel Encapsulation Limit destination header of the packet. The field pointed to has a value of one. <p> The tunnel entry-point node performs Path MTU discovery on the path between the tunnel entry-point and exit-point nodes [RFC-1981], <ref> [RFC-1885] </ref>. The tunnel MTU of a nested tunnel is the tunnel MTU of the outer tunnel minus the size of the tunnel headers. <p> The tunnel entry-point node IPv6 layer passes the received ICMP message to the ICMPv6 Input. The ICMPv6 Input, based on the ICMP type and code <ref> [RFC-1885] </ref> generates an internal "error code".

Reference-contexts: Hop limit: The tunnel IPv6 header hop limit is set to a pre-configured value - see section 6.3. The default value for hosts is the Neighbor Discovery advertised hop limit <ref> [RFC-1970] </ref>. The default value for routers is the default IPv6 Hop Limit value from the Assigned Numbers RFC (64 at the time of writing this Conta & Deering Expires in six months [Page 17] INTERNET-DRAFT Tunneling in IPv6 December 16, 1996 document). <p> The tunnel hop limit default value for hosts is the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery advertised hop limit <ref> [RFC-1970] </ref>. The tunnel hop limit default value for routers is the default IPv6 Hop Limit value from the Assigned Numbers RFC (64 at the time of writing this document).
