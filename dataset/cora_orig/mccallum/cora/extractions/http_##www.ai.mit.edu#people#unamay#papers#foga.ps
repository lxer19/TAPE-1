Title: The Troubling Aspects of a Building Block Hypothesis for Genetic Programming

Abstract: In this paper we carefully formulate a Schema Theorem for Genetic Programming (GP) using a schema definition that accounts for the variable length and the non-homologous nature of GP's representation. In a manner similar to early GA research, we use interpretations of our GP Schema Theorem to obtain a GP Building Block definition and to state a "classical" Building Block Hypothesis (BBH): that GP searches by hierarchically combining building blocks. We report that this approach is not convincing for several reasons: it is difficult to find support for the promotion and combination of building blocks solely by rigourous interpretation of a GP Schema Theorem; even if there were such support for a BBH, it is empirically questionable whether building blocks always exist because partial solutions of consistently above average fitness and resilience to disruption are not assured; also, a BBH constitutes a narrow and imprecise account of GP search behavior.

Reference-contexts: The GP BBH refers to the combining of schemas yet the GPST, by referring to the expected instances of only one schema, fails to describe the interactions of schemas. In this respect, the GP BBH is not supported by any interpretation of the GPST. Previous GA work <ref> [Grefenstette,Baker 1989, Liepins and Vose 1991, Whitley 1991] </ref> has made this point in much more detail. Many complicated interactions between competing schemas and hyperplanes take place in the course of a GA run.

Reference-contexts: The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses various options for a schema definition, and a more general definition than the one given in <ref> [Koza 1992] </ref> is chosen. We also give formal definitions of GP-schemas and of schema order and defining length. Section 3 presents the GPST as a recurrence relation that expresses the lower bound on expected instances of GP-schemas from one generation to the next. <p> The first schema definition we will consider is from <ref> [Koza 1992, p. 117-118] </ref>. According to Koza, a schema in GP is the set of all individual trees from the population that contain, as subtrees, one or more specified trees. <p> If the above divisor were the number of programs that are members of the schema, rather than i (H; t), fitness proportional selection would not guarantee expected reproduction relative to estimated average fitness. 3. Because the standard GP <ref> [Koza 1992] </ref> does not use mutation, we do not account for it. We define an estimate of the probability of disruption of any instantiation of H because P d (h; H) is not the same for every GP-instantiation involving H.
