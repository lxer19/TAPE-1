Abstract: Why We Don't Know How To Simulate The Internet Abstract Simulating how the global Internet data network behaves is an immensely challenging undertaking because of the network's great heterogeneity and rapid change. The heterogeneity ranges from the individual links that carry the network's traffic, to the protocols that interoperate over the links, to the mix of different applications used at a site and the levels of congestion (load) seen on different links. We discuss two key strategies for developing meaningful simulations in the face of these difficulties: searching for invariants and judiciously exploring the simulation parameter space. We finish with a look at a collaborative effort to build a common simulation environment for conducting Internet studies.

Reference-contexts: On the plus side, the research community has made significant advances in developing topology-generators for Internet simulations <ref> (Calvert, Doar and Zegura, 1997) </ref>. Several of the topology generators can create networks with locality 2 and hierarchy loosely based on the structure of the current Internet.

Reference-contexts: set in place, leading users to become much more sensitive to the type and quantity of traffic they send and receive. * The Internet routers switch from their present first come, first serve scheduling algorithm for servicing packets to methods that attempt to more equably share resources among different connections <ref> (such as Fair Queueing, discussed by Demers, Keshav and Shenker, 1990) </ref>. * Native multicast becomes widely deployed.

Reference-contexts: On longer time scales, non-stationary effects such as diurnal traffic load patterns become significant. In principle, self-similar traffic correlations can lead to drastic reductions in the effectiveness of deploying buffers in Internet routers in order to absorb transient increases in traffic load <ref> (Erramilli, Narayan and Willinger, 1996) </ref>. However, we must note that the network research community remains divided on the practical impact of self-similarity (Grossglauser and Bolot, 1996).

Reference-contexts: In addition, because the Internet includes non-linear feedback mechanisms, and often subtle coupling between its different elements, sometimes even a slight change in a parameter can completely change numerical results <ref> (see Floyd and Jacobson, 1992, for example) </ref>. In its simplest form, this approach serves only to identify elements to which a simulation scenario is sensitive.

Reference-contexts: However, we must note that the network research community remains divided on the practical impact of self-similarity <ref> (Grossglauser and Bolot, 1996) </ref>. That self-similarity is still finding its final place in network modeling means that a diligent researcher conducting Internet simulations must not a priori assume that its effects can be ignored, but must instead consider how to incorporate self-similarity into any traffic models used in a simulation.

Reference-contexts: That is, each source transmitting data over the network inspects the progress of the data transfer so far, and if it detects signs that the network is under stress, it cuts the rate at which it sends data, in order to do its part in diminishing the stress <ref> (Jacobson, 1988) </ref>. Consequently, the timing of a connection's packets as recorded in a trace intimately reflects the conditions in the network at the time the connection occurred. Furthermore, these conditions are not readily determined by inspecting the trace.

Reference-contexts: A second key property is that the Internet is big. The most recent estimate is that it included more than 16 million computers in Jan. 1997 <ref> (Lottor, 1997) </ref>. Its size brings with it two difficulties.

Reference-contexts: Even what we would assume must certainly be solid, unchanging statistical properties can change in a brief amount of time. For example, in Oct. 1992 the median size of an Internet FTP (file transfer) connection observed at LBNL was 4,500 bytes <ref> (Paxson, 1994b) </ref>. The median is considered a highly robust statistic, one immune to outliers (unlike the mean, for example), and in this case was computed over 60,000 samples.

Reference-contexts: For example, the widely used Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has undergone major evolutionary changes. A study of eleven different TCP implementations found distinguishing differences among nearly all of them <ref> (Paxson, 1997) </ref>, and major problems with several. Consequently, researchers must decide which real-world features and peculiarities to include in their study, and which can be safely ignored. For some simulation scenarios, the choice between these is clear; for others, determining what can be ignored can present considerable difficulties.

Reference-contexts: And/or: the level of multicast audio and video traffic explodes, as it appeared poised to do a few years ago. * The Internet deploys mechanisms for supporting different classes and qualities of service <ref> (Zhang et al., 1993) </ref>. These mechanisms would then lead to different connections attaining potentially much different performance than they presently do, with little interaction between traffic from different classes. * Web-caching becomes ubiquitous. For many purposes, Internet traffic today is dominated by World Wide Web connections.
