Abstract: Various types of probabilistic proof systems have played a central role in the development of computer science in the last decade. In this exposition, we concentrate on three such proof systems | interactive proofs, zero-knowledge proofs, and probabilistic checkable proofs | stressing the essential role of randomness in each of them. fl This exposition is an expanded version of a survey written for the proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM94) held in Zurich in 1994. It is hoped that this exposition may be accessible to a broad audience of computer scientists and mathematians.

Reference-contexts: An alternative presentation only specifies the verifier's strategy while rephrasing the completeness condition as follows: there exists a prover strategy P so that, for every x 2 S, the verifier V always accepts after interacting with P on common input x. Arthur-Merlin games 1 introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> are a special case of interactive proofs; yet, as shown in [31], this restricted case has essentially 2 the same power as the general case previously introduced in [30].

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 [43]: IP = PSPACE. Recall that it is widely believed that N P PSPACE. Thus, under this conjecture, interactive proofs are more powerful than NP-proofs. Concerning the finer structure of the IP hierarchy it is known that this hierarchy has a "linear speed-up" property <ref> [7] </ref>. Namely, for every integer function, f , so that f (n) 2 for all n, the class IP (O (f ())) collapses to the class IP (f ()). In particular, IP (O (1)) collapses to IP (2).

Reference-contexts: access to the set S itself. (Note that the prover in Construction 1 has this property.) This interpretation generalizes the notion of self-reducibility of NP-sets. (By self-reducibility of an NP-set we mean that the search problem of finding an NP-witness is polynomial-time reducible to deciding membership in the set.) See <ref> [10] </ref>. 3. A prover is considered relatively efficient if it can be implemented by a probabilistic machine which runs in time which is polynomial in the deterministic complexity of the set. This interpretation relates the difficulty of convincing a "lazy verifier" to the complexity of finding the truth alone.

Reference-contexts: Thm. 2 has a dramatic effect on the design of cryptographic protocols (cf., [24, 25]).

Reference-contexts: Interestigly, computationally-sound interactive proofs can be much more communication-efficient than (regular) interactive proofs; cf. [34, 38]. 5.2 Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs Actualy the term "non-interactive" is somewhat misleading. The model, introduced in <ref> [13] </ref>, consists of three entities: a prover, a verifier and a uniformly selected sequence of bits (which can be thought of as being selected by a trusted third party). Both verifier and prover can read the random sequence, and each can toss additional coins. <p> The interaction consists of a single message sent from the prover to the verifier, who then is left with the decision (whether to accept or not).

Reference-contexts: Clearly, this procedure can be implemented by a very efficient algorithm. In contrast, it is widely believed that there exists no efficient algorithm for finding proofs to given assertions in propositional calculus (since the task is NP-Hard see below). Traditionally, NP is defined as the class of NP-sets (cf., <ref> [22] </ref>). Yet, each such NP-set can be viewed as a proof system. For example, consider the set of satisfiable Boolean formulae.

Reference-contexts: The definitions presented above are a simplified version of the actual definitions. For example, in order to guarantee that zero-knowledge is preserved under sequential compo sition it is necessary to slightly augment the definitions. For details see <ref> [26] </ref>. 3.2 The power of zero-knowledge A simple example, demonstrating the power of zero-knowledge proofs, follows. Specifically, we will present a simple zero-knowledge proof for proving that a graph is 3-colorable. The interactive proof will be described using "boxes" in which information can be hidden and later revealed. <p> Namely, if either verifier or prover is required to be deterministic then only BPP-sets can be proven in a zero-knowledge manner <ref> [26] </ref>. However, BPP-sets have trivial zero-knowledge proofs in which the prover sends nothing and the verifier just test the validity of the assertion by itself 5 .

Reference-contexts: A sketch of the formal definition is given in Item (1) below. Items (2) and (3) introduce additional complexity measures which can be ignored in first reading. Definition 2 (Interactive Proofs - IP) <ref> [30] </ref>: 1. <p> Arthur-Merlin games 1 introduced in [4] are a special case of interactive proofs; yet, as shown in [31], this restricted case has essentially 2 the same power as the general case previously introduced in <ref> [30] </ref>. <p> See [38]. 4 Still, even in this case the interactive proof need not consist of the prover sending the auxiliary input to the verifier; e.g., an alternative procedure may allow the prover to be zero-knowledge (see Construction 2). 7 3 Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems Zero-knowledge proofs, introduced in <ref> [30] </ref>, are central to cryptography. Furthermore, zero-knowledge proofs are very intruiging from a conceptual point of view, since they exhibit an extreme contrast between being convinced of the validity of a statement and learning anything in addition while receiving such a convincing proof. <p> The specific variants differ by the interpretation given to `similarity'. The most strict interpretation, leading to perfect zero-knowledge, is that similarity means equality. Namely, Definition 3 (perfect zero-knowledge) <ref> [30] </ref>: A prover strategy, P , is said to be perfect zero-knowledge over a set S if for every probabilistic polynomial-time verifier strategy, V fl , there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm, M fl , such that (P; V fl )(x) = M fl (x) ; for every x 2 S <p> Based on some reasonable complexity assumptions, one may construct non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems for every NP-set (cf., [13, 18, 35]). 5.3 Proofs of knowledge The concept of a proof of knowledge, introduced in <ref> [30] </ref>, is very appealing; yet, its precise formulation is much more complex than one may expect (cf. [9]). <p> It can be shown that the protocol which results by successively applying Construction 2 suffiently many time constitutes a "proof of knowledge" of a 3-coloring of the input graph. 5.4 Knowledge complexity Zero-knowledge is the lowest level of a knowledge-complexity hierarchy which quantifies the "knowledge revealed in an interaction" <ref> [30] </ref>. Knowledge complexity may be defined as the minimum number of oracle-queries required in order to (efficiently) simulate an interaction with the prover [28]. Preliminary results concerning this measure have appeared in [27].

Reference-contexts: Thus, the validity of the verifier decision (concerning false statements) depends on whether this restriction (concerning "cheating" prover strategies) really holds. The reason to consider these restricted models is that they enable to achieve results which are not possible in the general model of interactive proofs (cf., <ref> [12, 15, 34, 38] </ref>). We consider restrictions of two types: computational or physical. We start with a physical restriction. <p> In CS-proofs [38], the prover stategy is restricted to be probabilistic and run in time polynomial in the time required to validate the assertion (analogously to item (3) in Sec. 2.4).

Reference-contexts: The interaction consists of a single message sent from the prover to the verifier, who then is left with the decision (whether to accept or not). Based on some reasonable complexity assumptions, one may construct non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems for every NP-set (cf., <ref> [13, 18, 35] </ref>). 5.3 Proofs of knowledge The concept of a proof of knowledge, introduced in [30], is very appealing; yet, its precise formulation is much more complex than one may expect (cf.

Reference-contexts: These bit locations need to be selected at random. The characterization of N P in terms of probabilistically checkable proofs plays a central role in recent developments concerning the difficulty of approximation problems (cf., [17], [2] and <ref> [37] </ref>). To demonstrate this relationship, we first note that Theorem 3 can be rephrased without mentioning the class PCP altogether. Instead, a new type of polynomial-time reductions, which we call amplifying, emerges.
