Abstract: Sprite is an operating system being designed for a network of powerful personal workstations. A virtual memory system has been designed for Sprite that currently runs on the Sun architecture. This virtual memory system has several important features. First, it allows processes to share memory. Second, it allows all of the physical pages of memory to be in use at the same time; that is, no pool of free pages is required. Third, it performs remote paging. Finally, it speeds program startup by using free memory as a cache for recently-used programs. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
