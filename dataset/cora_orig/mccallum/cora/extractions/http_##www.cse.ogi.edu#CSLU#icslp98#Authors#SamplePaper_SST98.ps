Abstract: This paper provides information for SST98 Student Day authors regarding the preparation of their papers for publication. This conference will have its proceedings published both on paper and on CDROM. This will allow authors to include sound and image files, and will allow readers to do full-text searching. To prepare both a printed Proceedings and an electronic version, we are requesting that authors follow the style sheet so as to facilitate the production of the Proceedings. The abstract heading uses the AbstractHeading style, which is 12 point Helvetica, Bold, Centred. The body of the abstract is in the Abstract style. The type font should be 10 point Helvetica. The paragraph can be justified or flush left. White space of 10 points (one line) should be left between paragraphs, and between paragraphs and headings.
