Abstract: With the intr oduction of the computer , narrative experiences can be found in new media applications as di - verse as MUDs, ar cade games and 3D immersive envi - ronments - and new applications are being created all the time. The form these nar rative experiences take ar e as diverse as their mediums: from the experiential stories of MUDs to the intricate branching plot paths of adventure games. But like with the intr oduction of television after decades of radio, a new medium calls for a new aesthetic, a new method of writing for that medium. Good func - tional models are needed to help define this aesthetic and specialized tools r equired to help build the work. The writing tool described in this paper, Agent Stories, is software currently under development for visually designing nonlinear cinematic stories for new digital media. Fiction writing is lar gely a process of creating believable characters and events within established narrative structures and contexts, often for the purpose of communicating a set of ideas or feelings. Rewriting is the process whereby the writer clarifies, intensifies or re - fines the ideas or feelings within the work, while also taking the work closer toward a structure familiar to the writer and often connected to the writers culture. On the other hand, to program a computer is to use a linguistic representation of certain computational elements and actions (nouns and verbs) to describe a series of logical executable operations. The purpose for program execu - tion is usually to communicate an idea, frame human user Structure, such as that used in narrative construction or computer programming, can be well represented using graphical tools. Illustrations of building structure in the form of blueprints, narrative structural models such as the Vertag triangle [13], software flowcharts, and visual pro - gramming languages (VPLs) such as Prograph CPX [10] are all examples of graphically represented structure. VPLs have been effective at getting people to rethink the design of programming languages and have worked toward making programming accessible to a wider range of users. For people who tend to think graphically , VPLs offer another way of approaching a form of expression which has been traditionally all text based. But can graphic languages be applied to narrative and possibly help writers see new forms of narrative, like nonlinear narrative?

Reference-contexts: A behavior is a set of rules which describe how an agent should perform in certain situations. The rules match situation or context with some action or behavior and alternative behavior. More detail on story agents can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. Once a framework and story web have been con - structed 3 , the Agent Stories software allows an audience user to sit down in front of the monitor and choose a story agent by name and have that agent create a story play list.

Reference-contexts: The screen arrangement will be somewhat reminiscent of the screen for Eastgate Systems Storyspace. <ref> [6] </ref> However, unlike Storyspace which has only two types of links at most, color will be used to identify the various types of links in Agent Stories, thus also providing the opportunity to feature selective viewing of a subset of link types by color .
