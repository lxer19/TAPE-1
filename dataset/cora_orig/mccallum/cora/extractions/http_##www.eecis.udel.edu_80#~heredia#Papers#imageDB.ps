Abstract: With the arrival of terrestrial digital TV, distribution channels with data throughput of around 19 Mbit/s become available. Besides conventional TV services, multimedia documents containing image databases are one of several applications that may share resources in these channels. Database transmission requires setting up data carousels that give users access to objects at any time. However, when the available bandwidth is restricted, access times may be severely compromised. In the paper, we propose a transmission method where images are decomposed in aggregate resolutions and then transmitted over multiple streams. Optimal selection of stream bandwidths allows fast access to low resolution components. Hence, users can browse documents without waiting for full image resolution unless it is so desired.

Reference-contexts: The gradient of Eqn. (9) constrained by the expressions in Eqn. (8) can be computed as @T =@fi i = t [(ff N =fi 2 i ) ] i 2 <ref> [1; N 1] </ref> and the associated Hessian matrix H = [h ij ] is h ij = 2t [(ff N =fi 3 i )] i = j N ] i 6= j The matrix H can be decomposed as D + cE, c &gt; 0, with D diagonal with positive entries, <p> 1 1 : : : 1 : : : : : : : : : : : : 3 7 2 6 fi 1 :: 3 7 2 6 1 :: 3 7 (12) where the diagonal terms are a j = 1 + ff N =ff j j 2 <ref> [1; N 1] </ref> (13) This system admits an analytical solution: fi i = m i;i (1 j=i+1 fi j ) i 2 [1; N 2] (14) where m 1;j = a 1 and m i1;j (1 m i1;i1 ) (16) 3.2 Minimizing first component access times The previous method guarantees a <p> fi 1 :: 3 7 2 6 1 :: 3 7 (12) where the diagonal terms are a j = 1 + ff N =ff j j 2 [1; N 1] (13) This system admits an analytical solution: fi i = m i;i (1 j=i+1 fi j ) i 2 <ref> [1; N 2] </ref> (14) where m 1;j = a 1 and m i1;j (1 m i1;i1 ) (16) 3.2 Minimizing first component access times The previous method guarantees a small total access time T .

Reference-contexts: In this work, file sections are transmitted together sequentially as shown in Fig. 1. Far from being a restriction, sequential transmission accelerates decoder operation. For file downloading, a decoder tunes to the particular stream carrying the data files (specified by carrier frequency and PID <ref> [2] </ref>), and downloads the file section by section. The control software at the decoder can operate in two modes: File Based Retrieval (FBR): Decoder waits for the first section (block) of the requested file. It then downloads all the sections that make up the file.

Reference-contexts: A stream is a broadcast path able to deliver data with CBR guaranteed band width. Files are encapsulated as modules using the DSM-CC protocol <ref> [3] </ref>. A module is segmented into one or more data blocks (MPEG-2 PSI sections) of up to 4096 bytes. Sections start with an 8-byte header and end with a 4-byte error control string (CRC-32). Sections are independent units which are later segmented into 188-byte MPEG-2 transport packets.

Reference-contexts: In the paper, database images are encoded and partitioned in components with aggregate resolutions (using for example EZW <ref> [4] </ref>). Partitioned components are transmitted over constant bit rate (CBR) streams carrying a particular level (e.g, low res, aggregate for med res, and aggregate for high res). Low resolution portions can be placed in fast carousels to allow users quick access at least to low resolution versions. <p> which gives: t = [ j=1 M X S j p j ] (2b) 1 (5) in a data carousel 3 Transmission of multiresolution im ages using multiple streams A method to alleviate the download delay is the decomposition of images in aggregate multiresolution components using methods such as EZW <ref> [4] </ref> or progressive JPEG. Analogous segmentation is used in Soft Caching [5]. Here, the available bandwidth b is divided into multiple CBR streams with bandwidths b 1 , b 2 , ..., b N .
