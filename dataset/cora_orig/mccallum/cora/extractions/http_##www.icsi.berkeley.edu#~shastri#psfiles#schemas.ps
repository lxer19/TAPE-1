Abstract: Despite considerable early enthusiasm, connectionist models for most of the central questions of cognitive science have not been found. We believe that technical innovations are required and here describe novel mechanisms for encoding active schemas and reactive plans. One key construct, synchrony-based binding, extends and is compatible with existing models of inference. The paper describes the mechanisms and their implementation using paradigmatic examples and discusses some broader implications of parameterized connectionist routines.

Reference-contexts: Our new work on language learning requires that the system demonstrate its knowledge of verbs by carrying out verbal commands using a body simulation package <ref> (Bailey et al., 1997) </ref>. This has naturally led us to study active schemas, which we call X-schemas, their use in concept learning, and their neural representation.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the schema does not require explicit control variables the external world and the agent's perceptual mechanisms for locating objects in space provide the schema with the requisite information <ref> (cf. Ballard et al., 1997) </ref>. Now imagine that the execution of this schema is interrupted and resumed subsequently. At this time the only critical requirement is that the invoking schema bind the object role of CLEAR to the same object that was initially intended to be cleared.

Reference-contexts: X-schemas can also be seen as a computational abstraction of the motor schemas in the animal motor control literature (Pearson, 1993) and a generalization of reactive systems and subsumption architectures from embodied AI <ref> (Brooks, 1986) </ref>. As a motivating example consider how a child might learn to recognize and use correctly English words like push and shove. Clearly, there are motor schemas involved, but these must be parameterized by the size and shape of the object, the direction and force of the motion, etc.

Reference-contexts: Most of our work with X-schemas treats them as unanalyzed computational primitives that can, in principle, be reduced to connectionist and eventually neural realization. The purpose of this paper is to describe one such reduction and its implementation. This draws upon our earlier work on connectionist routines <ref> (Feldman & Shastri, 1984) </ref> and recent work on SHRUTI, a connectionist model of reflexive reasoning (Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993). 2 CONNECTIONIST ENCODING OF X-SCHEMAS Our connectionist encoding of X-schemas involves a number of ideas. A key idea is the expression and propagation of dynamic bindings via temporal synchrony.

Reference-contexts: Our particular interest in connectionist routines arises from our studies of cross-linguistic word and concept learning. The motivating question is how children easily learn their native language although these often partition conceptual domains in radically different ways <ref> (Feldman et al., 1996) </ref>. Early work exhibited structured connectionist models combined with conventional backprop that did surprisingly well at learning spatial relation concepts (such as below or through) from simple movies labeled with the words from a variety of languages (Regier, 1996).

Reference-contexts: This has naturally led us to study active schemas, which we call X-schemas, their use in concept learning, and their neural representation. Our interest in X-schemas has been increased by the discovery that these active representations can help solve central problems in high level language and planning <ref> (Narayanan, 1997) </ref>. X-schemas can also be seen as a computational abstraction of the motor schemas in the animal motor control literature (Pearson, 1993) and a generalization of reactive systems and subsumption architectures from embodied AI (Brooks, 1986).

Reference-contexts: Early work exhibited structured connectionist models combined with conventional backprop that did surprisingly well at learning spatial relation concepts (such as below or through) from simple movies labeled with the words from a variety of languages <ref> (Regier, 1996) </ref>. But the feature based representations used in these models are inherently inadequate for capturing the meaning of words describing actions (such as push or drop).

A key idea is the expression and propagation of dynamic bindings via temporal synchrony. <p> Such bindings are propagated through the role nodes by the synchronization of connected role nodes. The idea of encoding and propagating dynamic bindings among roles using synchronization was introduced in the SHRUTI model of reflexive reasoning <ref> (Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993) </ref> and has been adapted to a wide range of problems (Henderson, 1994; Hummel & Biederman, 1992). The fact that the same dynamic binding mechanisms can also apply to active schemas is potentially of great importance. <p> In particular, every cluster that initiates a schema also receives a signal when the schema is completed. Each X-schema has a head focal cluster the ENABLE cluster that serves as the point of initiation. The ENABLE cluster of a shared schema has a connectionist switch <ref> (Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993) </ref> which controls the flow of signals into the schema. All schemas that invoke this shared schema have their appropriate focal clusters connected to this switch (see bottom of Figure 1). The switch behaves like a bidirectional k to 1 switch.

In the PUSH X-schema, the firing rate of the parameter node specifies the relative force to be applied during the push action.

Reference-contexts: The fact that the same dynamic binding mechanisms can also apply to active schemas is potentially of great importance. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that such propagation of synchronous activity is neurally plausible <ref> (Singer, 1993) </ref>. An execution trace of the push X-schema is shown in Figure 3. The ?, +, and nodes in each cluster serve control and coordination functions. The ? node can be viewed as an initiate or query node.
