Reference-contexts: Due to the practical nature of these prob-lems, data availability and objective relevance measure, similar tasks have been used to test machine learning algorithms in the past <ref> (Aha and Salzberg, 1994) </ref>. The task under consideration is known as an inverse kinematic, e.g., computation of the robot's joint angles to ensure that the end-effector coordinates will reach a desired position. This is a complex task which might be computationally intractable for complex systems.

Reference-contexts: There is little commonality between definitions of relevance used in different systems <ref> (Greiner, 1994) </ref>. The most common ground is reached when relevance is defined as something useful. Our definition of relevance is as follows: Definition 4 (Relevance) Retrieved cases are considered relevant if they are similar to the query with respect to current context.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the system becomes increasingly reactive, since over time, less planning is required as the machine learning component acquires more control rules. The Candide system <ref> (Luzeaux and Zavidovique, 1994) </ref> has been used for the acquisition of a control knowledge. The system learns a qualitative model of the system first, then, based on the mode, it creates a rule-based incremental controller that controls a given system.

Reference-contexts: The system is based on using case-based techniques and reinforcement learning. The learning module monitors the system and incrementally modifies the case representations to accommodate the changes. Because of the utility problem <ref> (Minton, 1988) </ref>, the SINS system uses only 10 cases to allow for a real time performance. In this paper we propose a novel learning control system called T A3 , which incorporates case-based reasoning (CBR). A case-based approach (Kolod-ner, 1993) relies on the concept that similar problems have similar solutions.

Reference-contexts: A learning control system for manipulators, whose endpoint is moving under geometrical constraints on a surface, was proposed in (Naniwa and Arimoto, 1995). (Jang, Choi and Ahn, 1995) describes an iterative learning system for precise tracking control with guaranteed convergence. In <ref> (Mitchell, 1990) </ref> the Theo-Agent architecture of a reactive system is proposed. The system is used in robot control and combines a stimulus-response fl This research was supported by the Information Technology Research Center of Ontario. The authors are indebted to J. Mylopoulos and D. <p> Thus, facing a new problem, a case-based system retrieves similar cases stored in a case base and adapts them to fit the problem at hand. The T A3 system is similar to the Theo-Agent architecture <ref> (Mitchell, 1990) </ref> in the sense that it acquires new knowledge over time to improve the control component. The difference is in the form of acquired knowledge. Theo-Agent constructs stimulus-response rules, while TA3 acquires episodic knowledge. T A3 is also similar to SINS, mainly because both system use case-based tech niques.

Reference-contexts: In T A3 Robot 1 only cardinality relaxation was used (i.e., only m of n, m &lt; n, attributes were required to match). A similar approach presented in <ref> (Ortega, 1995) </ref> yielded identical results accuracy improvement for m &lt; n. T A3 Robot 2 used value relaxation (i.e., relaxing attribute values) first and if this failed then cardinality relaxation was performed. Conclusions The results of the experiments prove the viability of our approach.
