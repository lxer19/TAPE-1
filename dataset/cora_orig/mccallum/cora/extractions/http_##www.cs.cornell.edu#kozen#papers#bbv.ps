Abstract: A theory satisfies the k-variable property if every first-order formula is equivalent to a formula with at most k bound variables (possibly reused). Gabbay has shown that a model of temporal logic satisfies the k-variable property for some k if and only if there exists a finite basis for the temporal connectives over that model. We give a model-theoretic method for establishing the k-variable property, involving a restricted Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game in which each player has only k pebbles. We use the method to unify and simplify results in the literature for linear orders. We also establish new k-variable properties for various theories of bounded-degree trees, and in each case obtain tight upper and lower bounds on k. This gives the first finite basis theorems for branching-time models of temporal logic.

Reference-contexts: This result was extended to other linear time structures by Stavi [16]. Amir and Gabbay <ref> [1] </ref> showed that any definable lexicographic product of time structures admitting a finite basis also admits a finite basis. This result gave the first infinite non-linear structures admitting a finite basis, although up to now no results have been established for trees.
