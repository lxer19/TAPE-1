Abstract: Matching pursuits refers to a greedy algorithm which matches structures in a signal to a large dictionary of functions. In this paper, we present a matching-pursuit based video coding system which codes motion residual images using a large dictionary of Gabor functions. One feature of our system is that bits are assigned progressively to the highest-energy areas in the motion residual image. The large dictionary size is another advantage, since it allows structures in the motion residual to be represented using few significant coefficients. Experimental results compare the performance of the matching-pursuit system to a hybrid-DCT system at various bit rates between 6 and 128 kbit/s. Additional experiments show how the matching pursuit system performs if the

Reference-contexts: The second model finds motion vectors in the same manner as SIM3, but builds the motion prediction image by translating enlarged, overlapping blocks of data, each weighted by a smooth sinusoidal window. This tends to improve the prediction by reducing errors at motion block edges <ref> [1] </ref>. More details on these two motion models are presented in [5]. In either case, the difference between the original and prediction images must be efficiently coded.

Reference-contexts: A practical system thus requires a generic algorithm capable of coding video sequences of reasonable complexity at around 20 kbit/s. In [5], we presented a video coding system using a matching pursuit algorithm. The system is based on the framework of a low bit rate hybrid-DCT system called SIM3 <ref> [2] </ref>, but where the DCT residual coder is replaced with a matching pursuit coder. This coder uses the matching pursuit algorithm [4] to decompose each motion residual image over a dictionary of separable 2-D Gabor functions. <p> It takes the form of a hybrid motion compensated system in which the motion residual images are coded using matching pursuits. Two different motion models are considered in this paper. The first model is identical to the block translational motion model used by SIM3 <ref> [2] </ref>. Motion vectors of half-pixel resolution are used to translate 16 fi 16 pixel blocks from the previous reconstructed image to form the current prediction image. A decision function allows motion blocks to split into four 8 fi 8 pixel blocks when necessary.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Efficient video compression algorithms are essential for a wide range of emerging applications. While MPEG <ref> [3] </ref> style hybrid-DCT algorithms work well for high-end applications such as broadcast HDTV, they are not suitable for applications which require very low bit rates. Personal video communication is a key example. This might be done using a dedicated videophone, a personal computer, or a wireless terminal.

Reference-contexts: The system is based on the framework of a low bit rate hybrid-DCT system called SIM3 [2], but where the DCT residual coder is replaced with a matching pursuit coder. This coder uses the matching pursuit algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> to decompose each motion residual image over a dictionary of separable 2-D Gabor functions. The resulting system was shown to perform well on low motion sequences at 10 and 20 kbit/s. <p> Each component structure in the summation is called an "atom." The primary task of the residual coder is to match the dictionary structures to the residual image and thus reduce it to a representative set of atoms. This is accomplished using a multi-stage algorithm called matching pursuits <ref> [4] </ref>. At each stage, the dictionary is searched for the structure which best matches the current stage residual image in an inner product sense. In theory, each of the dictionary structures should be compared to the residual image at all possible pixel-resolution locations.

Reference-contexts: Choosing Gabor functions allows us to avoid some of the artificial block edge effects of the DCT basis, since Gabor functions tend to decay smoothly at the edges. Separability is another nice property, since it reduces the computation necessary to perform the matching search <ref> [6] </ref>. In theory, neither of these restrictions are necessary, as any arbitrary set of 2-D structures would be compatible with the basic algorithm. Research is currently underway to create arbitrary separable and nonseparable structures using training techniques from vector quantization.
