Reference-contexts: Makefile Called by compile to actually compile the above files. In addition the user will need the appropriate MPI and PGAPack header (mpif.h and pgapackf.h) and library files (libmpi.a and libpgaO.a). 2.6 Compilation This section discusses compiling stalk.ga. For execution information see the STALK users guide <ref> [LeFaHaReWaSt95] </ref>. The source files, header files, and compilation files for stalk.ga are in the directory /home/STALK/source.ga. The subdirectory RCS there is a symbolic link to /home/STALK/source.RCS. This directory contains the source code in "revision control system" format.
