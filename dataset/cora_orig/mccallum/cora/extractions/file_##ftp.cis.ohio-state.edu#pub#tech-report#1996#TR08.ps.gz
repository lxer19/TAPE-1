Abstract: Reconstruction is prerequisite whenever a discrete signal needs to be resampled as a result of transformation such as texture mapping, image manipulation, volume slicing. and rendering. We present a new method for the characterization and measurement of reconstruction error in spatial domain. Our method uses the Classical Shannons Sampling Theorem as a basis to develop error bounds. We use this formulation to provide, for the first time, an efficient way to guarantee an error bound at every point by varying the size of the reconstruction f ilter. We go further to support position-adaptive reconstruction and data-adaptive reconstruction which adjust filter size to the location of reconstruction point and to the data values in its vicinity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with 1D signals, 2D signals (images), and 3D signals (vol umes).

Also, this metric is global in nature and does not provide error control on a point-wise basis.

Reference-contexts: theorems for multi-resolution spaces are useful, and one can use them in a similar manner as outlined here <ref> [6] </ref>[35]. An advantage of these sampling theorems is the escape from the assumption of strict bandlimitedness required by original sampling theorem. Also, these theorems can be extended to nonuniform sampling and oversampling [6]. In the second approach, the scanning or gathering devices are modelled with point spread functions (PSF). During the process of sampling, each sampled data is obtained as a result of a convolution of the original function with the PSF.

Reference-contexts: Anisotropic effects are always present unless a radially symmetric f ilter is employed. The ideal reconstruction equation is different then with the Sinc functions being replaced by Bessel functions <ref> [7] </ref>. In this paper we limit ourselves to separable f ilters, although similar results can be obtained from radially symmetric filters. 2.3 Other Approaches An advantage of using the Shannon s sampling theorem is that it provides a functional perspective.

They also allow adaptive filtering in a manner similar to MIP maps. However, their method is complicated and does not use memory ef ficiently.

Reference-contexts: These assumptions are not too restrictive, because the notion of bandlimitedness is general and can be applied to many forms of sampled data used in computer graphics and scientific visualization. Although most signals in question (e.g., images and volumes) are not actually bandlimited, since they are spatially finite <ref> [9] </ref>, for all practical purposes the assumption of bandlimitedness holds true; during the process of acquiring digital images, acquisition devices (e.g., cameras, scanners) perform a filtering operation and bandlimit the function.

The Phong illumination operator P takes the derivative (normal) at a point x, together with light, surface, and eye position information and computes the color at the point x. <p> However, the fourth approach is the most efficient method since illumination is not computed for every sample point. For this reason it is a commonly used method for volume shading <ref> [15] </ref>. We compare our reconstruction accuracy in the framework of the fourth approach.

Reference-contexts: The processing order of the axes is important and can determine the final quality of the image. Although separable filters are fast and easily implemented, separability introduces anisotropic effects because the 2D or 3D separable f ilter is aligned with the principal axes <ref> [23] </ref>. Anisotropic effects are always present unless a radially symmetric f ilter is employed. The ideal reconstruction equation is different then with the Sinc functions being replaced by Bessel functions [7]. <p> The quantity M is usually referred to as the half-filter length. We call the ensuing error truncation error and is denoted by e t . (7) Elsewhere in the literature, this error is often referred to as postaliasing <ref> [23] </ref>. T runcation error manifests itself as blurring, aliasing (jaggies), and ringing in an image. In practice, the function is never reconstructed with a truncated Sinc. Truncation is tantamount to multiplying the infinite filter with a spatially limited rectangular window. <p> In [28], Parker et al., compared the ef fectiveness of some resampling filters.

We then determined the errors of reconstruction by computing the dif ference between the perfectly reconstructed function (using the infinitely long Sinc filter) and the functions reconstructed using the nonadaptive, adaptive and cubic spline f ilters. We also set a threshold of 0.02 for both filtering schemes as before. <p> For instance, the dark areas around the hat are reconstructed with smaller length filters. The position of the resampling point still modulates the f ilter size.

A common solution is to use a window function besides a rectangle [22][25]. Among the most popular window functions are triangular (Bartlett), Hanning, Hamming, and Kaiser [25]. These functions further alter the characteristics of the truncated frequency spectrum, and the choice of one window function over another is a trade of f between blurring and aliasing. We employ the Hamming window in the work reported here (Equation 8). <p> However, it is well known that the truncated Sinc filter actually possess a lower mean square error from the ideal frequency response than filters obtained through the use of a non-rectangular window <ref> [25] </ref>. Therefore, it is important to note that this characterization of the reconstruction error is purely numerical and is not based on perceptual considerations that address the issue of the suitability of an image to a human observer. <p> It is important to note that any filter can be used instead of a windowed-Sinc filter. Thus, we now have a function NS instead of the Sinc function S. Once again we can use either the spectral ener gy or the maximum value of the function. Using Parsevals Theorem <ref> [25] </ref> and Equation 26, we can write (33) The integral computes the dif ference between the two functions in the L 2 norm space. The quantity E f (M) is the energy of the signal in a 2M+1 sized neighborhood around the resampling point R.

In <ref> [28] </ref>, Parker et al., compared the ef fectiveness of some resampling filters. However, they propose no metrics that can be used to judge the goodness of a resampling f ilter.

In <ref> [28] </ref> similar observations are made. However, these observations were made in the frequency domain. Also, the error was not quantif ied. An important implication from this observation is that one can use filters of different lengths depending on the location of the resampling point.

Such a contour is shown in Figure 5. <p> The intuition behind using the contour is that it generalizes the process of f iltering to the complex plane. The contour C is the equivalent to the filter used to reconstruct real valued signals and could be of any shape. However, it needs to be closed and directional <ref> [30] </ref>. The rectangle is normally chosen for its simplicity. We now state Theorem 1, which provides us with a way to compute the error bound for f iltering interpolation schemes. <p> This contour integration used in Theorem 1 once again generalizes the infinite sum of the contributions from sampled data points to the reconstructed value. Further details on contour integration and other results in complex analysis can be found in <ref> [30] </ref>. Theorem 1: Let C be the contour (shown in Figure 5) over the domain D (a subset of the complex plane), and let function f be analytic everywhere therein (i.e., it is def ined everywhere, and all derivatives exist). <p> By using other functions for G (z) we can determine the error for various function approximations. Proof: The starting point of this proof is the Cauchy Integral Formula <ref> [30] </ref>, which allows us to compute the function f 1 (x) as follows: (22) As mentioned earlier, the integral is performed on a contour C (Figure 5). <p> It is true that (28) The numerator in Equation 25 for all contours is bounded by E f cosh (pr|y|/h) [13]. Since the cosh function grows faster than the sinh function <ref> [30] </ref>, for the same argument, on contours C 1 and C 3 in the limiting case the numerator becomes zero. Now let us consider contours C 2 and C 4 .

Reference-contexts: Although there is a positive correlation between numerical error and image quality, not much is known about their relationship <ref> [31] </ref>. A perceptual model, for example, will assign a larger error to truncated Sinc filters than to windowed Sinc.

Reference-contexts: The second condition indicates the integrability of F (w) or that f belongs to the L 1 space <ref> [32] </ref>. These assumptions are not too restrictive, because the notion of bandlimitedness is general and can be applied to many forms of sampled data used in computer graphics and scientific visualization. <p> The reconstructed function can be thought to be composed from an orthogonal basis of Sinc functions S (x,k,h), <ref> [32] </ref>. Equation 3 readily ratifies this perspective, because the contribution at point x is the weighted sum of Sinc functions indexed by k. Also, at the sampled data locations the right-hand side of Equation 3 evaluates to the original function value. <p> Because all signals under consideration have finite energy and are real and available as sampled datasets, E f can be simply determined by: (26) This relationship is a direct consequence of the Cardinal Series Expansion <ref> [32] </ref>. We now state and provide a sketch of the proof of Theorem 2, which expresses the truncation error bound in terms of the spectral energy of the function.

Reference-contexts: However , the adaptivity is not driven by any user defined error threshold but is guided by an ad hoc measure of the robustness of the filtering operation in the frequency domain. Adaptive filtering in the frequency domain is also reported by Totsuka and Levoy <ref> [33] </ref> for 3D volumes. Again, the adaptivity is not driven by an error threshold. Also, the technique requires that the filtering be conducted in the frequency domain, which requires transforming and storing a a large 3D dataset.

Reference-contexts: In Figure 4b we show the effect of using a Hamming window. It is not imperative that we only use a windowed Sinc. We can also use any of the commonly used resampling filters <ref> [34] </ref>. Other solutions include using trilinear interpolation (cone filter) and the cubic convolution filters [9][23]. For multiple dimensions we can use a product of two 1D window functions to get a 2D window function. <p> The gradient angle image for the trilinear interpolated slice (Figure 16b) is more blocky and disoriented than the one obtained by our methods (Figure 16d). The zero-phase property of Equation 3 need not be used <ref> [34] </ref>. We can use a neighborhood of size 2M along each dimension instead of 2M+1. This allows for the reduction in the time expended on the interpolation operation.

Reference-contexts: V oxel intensity, opacity, or color needs to be determined at intermediate points inside the volume. Interpolation is the reconstruction method of choice in all the afore-mentioned algorithms. Reconstruction in the source grid is much rarer and is conducted through the use of reconstruction kernels.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, reconstruction is also needed when a 3D volume [16] is subjected to affine transformations (e.g., translation, scaling, rotation [11] or orthographic ray casting <ref> [38] </ref>) or non-affine transformations (e.g., perspective ray casting [15] and deformation [18]). V oxel intensity, opacity, or color needs to be determined at intermediate points inside the volume. Interpolation is the reconstruction method of choice in all the afore-mentioned algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Moreover , this bound overestimates the error because it does not take into account the oscillating nature of the Sinc function. We now consider some tractable error bounds that can be used in practice. The error bound for this infinite sum can be found by resorting to complex analysis <ref> [39] </ref>. However, before we state the relevant results, we discuss the important idea of frequency guards. Frequency guard bands allow the approximation of the infinite sum in Equation 18 by the integral of an analytic function that exists on the real line.
