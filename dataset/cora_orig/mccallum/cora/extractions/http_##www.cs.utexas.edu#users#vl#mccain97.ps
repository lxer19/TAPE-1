Title: Causal Theories of Action and Change  
Author: Norman McCain and Hudson Turner

Abstract: For many commonsense reasoning tasks associated with action domains, only a relatively simple kind of causal knowledge (previously studied by Geffner and Lin) is required. We define a mathematically simple language for expressing knowledge of this kind and describe a general approach to formalizing action domains in it. The language can be used to express ramification and qualification constraints, explicit definitions, concurrency, nondeterminism, and dynamic domains in which things change by themselves.

Reference-contexts: Notice also that, intuitively, the literal :Heads does not designate an inertial fluent, since it holds when the coin is in either of two orientations. The same is true of :Tails and :(:Heads^:Tails). 7 We note in passing that one can do query answering and satisfiability planning <ref> (Kautz & Selman 1992) </ref> in the Suitcase domain by using the literal completion of D. chosen to model the suitcase being open as a static effect of the latches being up, so there is no time in any causally possible world history at which both latches are up and the suitcase

Reference-contexts: However, A being on at t does not cause B to be on at t, so the corresponding sentence of form (i) is false. 3 In <ref> (Lifschitz 1997) </ref>, Vladimir Lifschitz reformulates the central definitions for the case of predicate logic. By a causal law we mean an expression of the form ) (1) where and are formulas of the underlying propositional language. By the antecedent and consequent of (1), we mean the formulas and , respectively.

Reference-contexts: Given a fluent formula and a time name t, we will write t to stand for the formula obtained from by simultaneously replacing each occurrence of each fluent name f by the atom f t . Suitcase Domain We illustrate our approach by formalizing an action domain adapted from <ref> (Lin 1995) </ref> in which there is a suitcase with two latches, each of which may be in either of two positions, up or down. The suitcase is spring-loaded so that whenever both latches are in the up position the suitcase is caused to be open.

Reference-contexts: Ramification and Qualification Constraints Ramification and qualification constraints, in the sense of Lin and Reiter (1994), are formalized by schemas of the forms True ) t : t ) False respectively, where (the constraint) is a fluent formula. A similar result appears in <ref> (McCain & Turner 1995) </ref>. Nondeterministic Actions The semantics of causal theories rests on the principle of universal causation, according to which every fact is caused. Intuitively, in the case of a nondeterministic action, there is no cause for one of its possible effects rather than another. <p> In the case of events, this may or may not be so. Concluding Remarks We have defined a simple nonmonotonic formalism for expressing causal theories and a novel approach to formalizing action domains. The main assumptions underlying the formalism|universal causation and completeness|are already present in the causal framework of <ref> (McCain & Turner 1995) </ref>. 8 In this earlier framework, causal knowledge is represented by inference rules. An inference rule = can be used to represent the knowledge that: Necessarily, if the fact that is caused, then the fact that is caused .

Reference-contexts: Proposition. Let D be a causal theory that satisfies conditions (i) and (ii) above. The causally explained interpretations according to D are precisely the models of the literal completion of D. An easy proof appears in <ref> (McCain & Turner 1997) </ref>. Notice that the method of literal completion is applicable to examples D 1 and D 2 .
