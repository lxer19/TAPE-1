Reference-contexts: In particular, per (U )=0, that is, perrank (B) &lt; m 1, a contradiction. This lemma gives the first part of the following theorem, and the second part then follows via the argument of [3] and Theorem 1.2 of <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We don't know examples of equality in Theorem 2.3 if l 2 and we believe the theorem is not tight. In fact, we don't know any example with perrank (A 1 A 2 ) &lt; n. Motivated by the additive basis problem, the authors of <ref> [2] </ref> conjectured that perrank (A B) = n for any nonsingular n fi n matrices A; B over Z 3 . (Remarks: this statement can be shown by Lemma 1.4 to be equivalent to Conjecture 4.3 (in the case p = 3) of [2]. <p> the additive basis problem, the authors of <ref> [2] </ref> conjectured that perrank (A B) = n for any nonsingular n fi n matrices A; B over Z 3 . (Remarks: this statement can be shown by Lemma 1.4 to be equivalent to Conjecture 4.3 (in the case p = 3) of [2]. <p> We can use this and Lemma 1.4 to give an alternative proof of (essentially) the bound in Lemma 3.6 of <ref> [2] </ref>. Finally we have a strange result for fields of characteristic 0. Lemma 2.7 Suppose the i-th row of A mfin has at least 2i 1 nonzero elements and p = 0, then perrank (A) = m: Proof. We proceed by induction, the lemma being trivial when m = 1.

Reference-contexts: This was proved by Alon-Tarsi <ref> [3] </ref> for every non-prime finite field. The case jF j = 1 is trivial, but the case F = Z p (p 5) remains open. See [4] for a matroid approach. <p> See [4] for a matroid approach. Motivated by Conjecture 2.1, Jeff Kahn (personal communication) proposed: Conjecture 2.2 For any nfin nonsingular matrix A over any field, perrank (A A) = n: - 3 - Conjecture 2.2 implies Conjecture 2.1 via the polynomial argument of <ref> [3] </ref>. It also immediately implies Theorem 1.3. Actually Theorem 1.3 was motivated by Conjecture 2.2. Conjecture 2.2 is true when p = 3 (see [3]) and we also verified it for n 4. <p> any nfin nonsingular matrix A over any field, perrank (A A) = n: - 3 - Conjecture 2.2 implies Conjecture 2.1 via the polynomial argument of <ref> [3] </ref>. It also immediately implies Theorem 1.3. Actually Theorem 1.3 was motivated by Conjecture 2.2. Conjecture 2.2 is true when p = 3 (see [3]) and we also verified it for n 4. Theorem 2.3 For any n fi n nonsingular matrices A 1 ; A 2 ; ; A l , perrank (A 1 A 2 A l ) (1 2 l )n Proof. <p> The theorem follows by induction on l. This theorem implies a small result on Conjecture 2.1. Choose l = p 2 and A 1 = A 2 = = A l = A. Then the argument of <ref> [3] </ref> gives Proposition 2.4 For any nfin nonsingular matrix A over Z p , there is a vector x without zero entries such that Ax has at most n=2 p2 zero entries. In particular, Conjecture 2:1 is true if n &lt; 2 p2 . <p> In particular, per (U )=0, that is, perrank (B) &lt; m 1, a contradiction. This lemma gives the first part of the following theorem, and the second part then follows via the argument of <ref> [3] </ref> and Theorem 1.2 of [1].

Reference-contexts: Then P r (perrank (A) = m) P r (rank (A) = m): In particular, if m = n we have Pr (per (A)=0) Pr (det (A)=0). As n ! 1, lim (Pr (det (A) = 0)) is well-known (see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>). But as far as we know, lim (Pr (per (A) = 0)) is not known. Theorem 1.3 For any matrix A, perrank (A) rank (A)=2: Proof. We may assume A is an n fi n nonsingular matrix and let m = perrank (A). <p> This means exactly that x r+1 = 0 (using p 6= 2). Similarly x r+2 = = x s = 0: The next result gives Conjecture 2.2 almost surely for a uniformly chosen random nonsingular matrix, since lim (Pr (det (A) 6= 0)) &gt; 0 (again see <ref> [5] </ref>). Corollary 2.6 Suppose A is an n fi n random matrix with each entry chosen independently and uniformly from a finite field F, then P r (perrank (A A) = n) ! 1 as n ! 1: Proof.

Reference-contexts: The additive basis problem was motivated by the nowhere-zero flow problem, see section 3.3 of <ref> [6] </ref> for more details.) Noga Alon (personal communication) has shown that for A chosen uniformly from the nonsingular n fi n matrices over F , Conjecture 2.1 is true almost surely as n ! 1. We will show that Conjecture 2.2 is true almost surely in the same sense.

Reference-contexts: The coefficient matrix of this linear system is exactly the inclusion matrix M (k; r; r + 1). Kantor <ref> [7] </ref> showed that inclusion matrix always has full rank over field of characteristic 0. Since k 2m 1 &gt; 2r, the number of equations is at least the number of unknowns, so all unknowns are zero. In particular, per (U )=0, that is, perrank (B) &lt; m 1, a contradiction.

Reference-contexts: Then adding a multiple of this column to any other column doesn't change perrank (A): - 2 - This lemma suggests that we can use elementary operations to study the permanent. (This idea has also been discovered independently by Kogan and Makowsky; see section 3.5 of <ref> [8] </ref>.) The following result (true for p = 3 only) is an application of this idea. Theorem 1.5 If p = 3, then perrank (A) = perrank (A 1 ) for any nonsingular A. Proof.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recall that the permanent of an n fi n matrix is defined like the determinant, but with all n! terms having positive signs (see <ref> [9] </ref>). Define the perrank of a matrix A to be the size of a largest square submatrix of A with nonzero permanent. Throughout this paper F denotes a field, p denotes char (F ) and Z p denotes the finite prime field of p elements.
