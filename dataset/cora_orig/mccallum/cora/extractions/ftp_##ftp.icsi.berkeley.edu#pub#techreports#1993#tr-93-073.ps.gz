Abstract: It was known that if one-way functions exist, then there are zero-knowledge proofs for every language in PSPACE. We prove that unless very weak one-way functions exist, Zero-Knowledge proofs can be given only for languages in BPP. For average-case definitions of BPP we prove an analogous result under the assumption that uniform one-way functions do not exist.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The complexity-theoretic approach to cryptography of the last several years has been to establish minimal complexity assumptions for basic cryptographic primitives and to establish connections among these primitives. At the very heart of cryptography is the notion of a one-way function <ref> [DH-76] </ref> which was shown to be necessary and sufficient for many cryptographic primitives. For example, pseudo-random generators [BM-82] and digital signatures [GMRi-88] were shown to be equivalent to the existence of one-way functions [ILL-89, Ha-90, NY-89, R-90].

If they were both efficiently sampleable, then we would have two distributions which are statistically different but computationally indistinguishable, which implies the existence of a one-way function by <ref> [G-89] </ref> note (in other words, theorem 5 would rule out this possibility and we would be done). But the real conversation is not sampleable. Thus, we have two distributions, (which are statistically different but computationally indistinguishable) such that one of this two distributions is not sampleable.

The subject of this paper is the relationship between one-way functions and zero-knowledge proofs. While one-way functions were shown to be sufficient for zero-knowledge proofs <ref> [GMR-85, GMW-86, IY-87, ILL-89, Ha-90, N-89] </ref>, the question of necessity was open. 1.1 Main notions and results A function f is one-way if one efficient algorithm (encoder) can compute it, but no other efficient algorithm (inverter) can invert it too often. <p> We have: 1 FACT BPP ZK IP. In [GMW-86] it was shown that the existence of uniform one-way functions is sufficient for nontrivial zero-knowledge; they proved that this assumption implies N P ZK (in [GMW-86] they used one-way permutations, from <ref> [ILL-89, Ha-90, N-89] </ref> the result can be restated with arbitrary one-way functions.) This results made zero-knowledge a central tool in secure protocol design and fault-tolerant distributed computing [GMW-86, Yao-86, GMW-87]. <p> In fact, only languages in AM T co-AM can have such proofs [AH-87, F-87]. Nevertheless, the ideas developed in [Ost-91] are utilized in an essential way in our construction. Our proofs also utilize many of the techniques (and their consequences) that were developed by <ref> [ILL-89, Ha-90] </ref> for showing the equivalence of one-way functions and pseudorandom generators. In particular, we use the notions of distributional one-way functions [ILu-89], efficient universal extrapolation [ILe-90], and the note of [G-89] on computational versus statistical indistinguishability. <p> satisfying for all x 2 fl P rob (1 ff)jM 2 j x;M 1 (x) &lt; N (x; M 1 (x); ff) &lt; (1 + ff)jM 2 j x;M 1 (x) 1 ff Here are the first two major consequences of our assumption 6 91W F ; both follow from <ref> [JVV-86, ILL-89, Ha-90, ILu-89, ILe-90, BP-92] </ref> though they show it for uniform one-way functions (i.e. they consider = f0g). The extension to auxiliary-input one-way functions is straightforward.

Reference-contexts: At the very heart of cryptography is the notion of a one-way function [DH-76] which was shown to be necessary and sufficient for many cryptographic primitives. For example, pseudo-random generators [BM-82] and digital signatures [GMRi-88] were shown to be equivalent to the existence of one-way functions <ref> [ILL-89, Ha-90, NY-89, R-90] </ref>. Moreover, many other cryptographic primitives, including identification, coin-flipping and secret key exchange were shown to imply the existence of a one-way function [ILu-89]. A central notion to modern cryptography is the notion of zero-knowledge proof system, pioneered by [GMR-85].

Reference-contexts: Since it is much easier to hide information from someone who does not cheat, constructing a zero-knowledge proof for this case is typically much easier. 1.2 Relation to previous work and techniques Necessity of one-way functions for various restricted classes of zero-knowledge proofs was previously considered in <ref> [FS-89, D-89, Ost-91] </ref>. The main such result is by [Ost-91]. He proves it for the very special case of statistical zero-knowledge proofs [GMR-85]. In these proofs, the simulator is required to produce a distribution of prover-verifier conversations that is statistically close to the real distribution. <p> The main such result is by <ref> [Ost-91] </ref>. He proves it for the very special case of statistical zero-knowledge proofs [GMR-85]. In these proofs, the simulator is required to produce a distribution of prover-verifier conversations that is statistically close to the real distribution. <p> Note that statistical zero-knowledge proofs are known only for a handful of languages, such as graph isomorphism, graph non-isomorphism, and quadratic residuosity. In fact, only languages in AM T co-AM can have such proofs [AH-87, F-87]. Nevertheless, the ideas developed in <ref> [Ost-91] </ref> are utilized in an essential way in our construction. Our proofs also utilize many of the techniques (and their consequences) that were developed by [ILL-89, Ha-90] for showing the equivalence of one-way functions and pseudorandom generators. <p> Such an algorithm was given in <ref> [Ost-91] </ref>, for the case that (P; V ) is statistical zero-knowledge proof of L. It will turn out that the same algorithm will work for us, but this will require some extra arguments as will become clear later. Let us describe his algorithm A. <p> This part of the argument does not use zero-knowledge, and will work for us as well. The hard part is showing that A will accept most of the time when x 2 L. This is in fact what we show. In particular, for the statistical case <ref> [Ost-91] </ref> show that C A (x2L) s = C P V (x2L) , which guarantees that for all x 2 L algorithm A will except with probability close to 2 3 . <p> This will be the same algorithm used in <ref> [Ost-91] </ref> in the case that L had statistical zero-knowledge proof (i.e. c in condition (3) was replaced by s Let S be a machine just like S, but whose output on x is only C S (x) n (rather than R S (x) ]C n ).

Reference-contexts: Extending this result, [IY-87] (see also [B+ 88]) showed that in fact the existence of uniform one-way functions imply ZK = IP (which we know to be equal to PSPACE <ref> [LFKN-90, S-90] </ref>). Thus, every provable language possesses a zero-knowledge proof, and ZK is as large as possible. Summarizing the sufficient condition we have: Theorem (follows from references above) (Informal statement): If uniform one-way functions exist then ZK = IP (= PSPACE).
