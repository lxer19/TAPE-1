Abstract: A new concept of multidestination wormhole mechanism is proposed which allows a message to be propagated along any valid path in a wormhole network conforming to the underlying base routing scheme (ecube, planar, turn, or fully adaptive). Two schemes are developed and evaluated to perform fast multicasting and broadcasting in 2D/3D meshes/tori using this new mechanism. Not only do these schemes demonstrate superiority over Umesh [10] and Hamiltonian Path [9] schemes, they indicate an interesting result that the cost of multicast can be reduced or kept near-constant as the degree of multicast increases. Variations of the proposed schemes to take advantage of routing-adaptivity are also presented. These results are the first ones in the wormhole-routing literature to propose multicasting schemes with such reduced overhead and provision for taking advantage of adaptivity. It lays a new foundation in building high-performance wormhole architecture for supporting fast collective communication operations.

Reference-contexts: However, added dependency across multidestination 4 worms may arise if each node in the system has limited number of consump-tion channels <ref> [1, 12] </ref>. We illustrate this deadlock property through examples and propose solutions to achieve deadlock-freedom. Consider the Hamiltonian Path-based scheme [9] with dual-path implementation. From a given source, the high-path (low-path) is used for sending messages to higher (lower) numbered destination nodes. <p> Since these consumption channels are needed to provide deadlock-freedom instead of increasing network throughput <ref> [1] </ref>, these can be configured as virtual consumption channels instead of physical consumption channels. It is to be noted that systems like Intel Paragon already have provision to use up to two physical consumption channels for each router.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, the wormhole-routed systems have supported only point-to-point (unicast) message passing mechanism with one destination per message. This leads to costly implementation of collective communication and synchronization operations on these systems with multiple phases of unicast message exchange. Some examples are: broadcasting algorithms by Van de Geijn <ref> [2] </ref>, mul-ticasting algorithms using Umesh operations by McKinley [10], and complete ?

To reduce the number of phases, a Hamilto--nian Path-based scheme has been proposed by Ni [9].

Reference-contexts: It can be easily seen that such a situation will lead to deadlock in the system. Hence, the dual-path implementation assumes an implicit 2 consumption channels per node.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The wormhole-routing switching technique is becoming the trend in building future parallel systems due to its inherent advantage of low-latency communication <ref> [6, 12] </ref>. Intel Paragon, Cray T3D, Ncube, J-Machine, and Stanford DASH are representative systems falling into this category.

We can allocate a dedicated consumption channel per each pair of positive and negative dimensions. One extra channel can be used as an `escape' channel. Now, similar to the arguments made by Duato <ref> [7] </ref>, it can be easily shown that a solution of (n + 1) consumption channels per node provides deadlock-freedom. This result indicates that only 3 consumption channels per node are required for a 2D e-cube mesh. This is only one extra compared to the Hamiltonian-path model.

Reference-contexts: To reduce the number of phases, a Hamilto--nian Path-based scheme has been proposed by Ni <ref> [9] </ref>. This scheme uses a modified router organization to support propagation of multidestination messages (a message with multiple destinations) and allows a message to be consumed at a destination node while being forwarded to the next node concurrently. <p> Intrinsic benefits of this model together with deadlock-freedom properties and architectural supports are discussed. 2 2.1 Multidestination Wormhole Mechanism The concept of wormhole message passing mechanism with multiple destinations was used in <ref> [9] </ref> to perform fast multicast operations with Hamiltonian-Path-based routing. Under this mechanism, the header of a worm consists of multiple destinations. The sender node creates these destinations as an ordered list, depending on their intended order of traversal. <p> However, added dependency across multidestination 4 worms may arise if each node in the system has limited number of consump-tion channels [1, 12]. We illustrate this deadlock property through examples and propose solutions to achieve deadlock-freedom. Consider the Hamiltonian Path-based scheme <ref> [9] </ref> with dual-path implementation. From a given source, the high-path (low-path) is used for sending messages to higher (lower) numbered destination nodes. <p> This test-bed 11 implements flit-level simulation and can be configured for different topological and technological parameters. We compared our scheme with Hamiltonian Path-based scheme <ref> [9] </ref> and Umesh algorithm [10]. For all simulation experiments, we assumed system parameters representing the current trend in technology. The following parameters were used: t s (communication start-up time) as 1.0 microseconds, t p (link propagation time) as 5.0 nsec, and t node (router delay) as 20.0 nsec.

To reduce the number of phases, a Hamilto--nian Path-based scheme has been proposed by Ni [9]. <p> Similarly, a level-i leader is also a level-(i-1) leader, 2 i m. After the grouping is achieved, the multicast takes place in two phases. In the first phase, the source performs unicast-based multicast <ref> [10] </ref> to the set L m in dlog 2 (jL m j + 1)e steps. The second phase involves m steps of multidestination message-passing. <p> We thus have six level-1 leaders and two level-2 leaders in this example. It is to be noted that each level-2 leader is also a level-1 leader. The multicast takes place in two phases. In the first phase, the source uses the Umesh algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> to send out unicast messages to the two level-2 leaders. In the next phase, these two level-2 leaders send out multidestination worms along dimension 1 to cover the level-1 leaders. <p> This test-bed 11 implements flit-level simulation and can be configured for different topological and technological parameters.

Intel Paragon, Cray T3D, Ncube, J-Machine, and Stanford DASH are representative systems falling into this category. Such systems are being used for supporting either distributed-memory, shared-memory, or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms. <p> If the network supports planar-adaptive routing scheme, a message can also be propagated along a diagonal path. Similar flexibility exists for networks supporting fully-adaptive routing and turn model. To demonstrate the potential of this new mechanism, we develop and present two schemes for multicast, an important collective communication operation <ref> [12] </ref>. These schemes perform far better compared to the Umesh and Hamiltonian-path-based schemes even for systems with e-cube routing. As the number of destinations for a multicast increases, we show that the cost of multicast can in fact be reduced. <p> However, added dependency across multidestination 4 worms may arise if each node in the system has limited number of consump-tion channels <ref> [1, 12] </ref>. We illustrate this deadlock property through examples and propose solutions to achieve deadlock-freedom. Consider the Hamiltonian Path-based scheme [9] with dual-path implementation. From a given source, the high-path (low-path) is used for sending messages to higher (lower) numbered destination nodes. <p> If the base routing scheme requires v virtual channels per physical channel to provide deadlock-free unicast communication, there might be 2nv worms trying to enter a node concurrently in a k-ary n-cube system <ref> [12] </ref>. This leads to an upper bound of 2nv consumption channels per node. The following theorem provides us the minimum number of consumption channels required for e-cube systems.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a 3D e-cube system will require 4 consumption channels. For adaptive routing schemes supporting v virtual channels per physical channel to provide deadlock-free unicast communication, we hypothesize that (n + 1)v or (nv + 1) consumption channels are sufficient to provide deadlock-free communication under the BRCP model <ref> [14] </ref>. Since these consumption channels are needed to provide deadlock-freedom instead of increasing network throughput [1], these can be configured as virtual consumption channels instead of physical consumption channels. <p> Proof: Due to space limitation, we only provide a sketch of the proof here. The readers are requested to refer to <ref> [14] </ref> for the details. Since a greedy approach 9 Fig. 5. An example multicasting in a 2D mesh using multiphase greedy scheme. is used, the number of destinations covered in the first few steps determine the overall complexity. <p> Similar observations were also made for systems with wraparound connections. Due to the space limitation, we are not able to report these results here and the readers are requested to refer to <ref> [14] </ref> for details. 6 Conclusions and Future Research In this paper we have introduced a new multidestination worm mechanism conforming to the base routing scheme of wormhole systems.
