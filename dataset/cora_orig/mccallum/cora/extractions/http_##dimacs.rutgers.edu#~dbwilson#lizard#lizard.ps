Abstract: This work gives a proof of convergence for a learning algorithm that describes how anoles (lizards found in the Carribean) learn a foraging threshold distance. An anole will pursue a prey if and only if it is within this threshold of the anole's perch. The learning algorithm was proposed by the biologist Roughgar-den and his colleagues. They experimentally confirmed that this algorithm quickly converges to the foraging threshold that is predicted by optimal foraging theory. Our analysis provides an analytic confirmation that the learning algorithm converges to this optimal foraging threshold with probability one.

Reference-contexts: the number of prey arriving in one time interval is independent of the number of prey arriving in any other non-overlapping time interval, and the assumption that the probability that two prey arrive at exactly the same time is zero, imply that prey arrive according to a stationary Poisson distribution <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus, the appearance of prey is modeled by a stationary Poisson process, such that a is the expected number of prey that appear per unit area per second. <p> To do this, we will use Lemmas 3 and 4. Both lemmas may be applied to any finite interval, so we will apply them to the intervals <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; [1; 2]; : : :. Any interval [i; i + 1] may be subdivided into subintervals of size 1=M (for any M &gt; 1 ). <p> To do this, we will use Lemmas 3 and 4.
