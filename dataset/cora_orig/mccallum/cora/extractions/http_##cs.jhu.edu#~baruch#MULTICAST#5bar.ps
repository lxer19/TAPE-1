Abstract: Multicast routing and admission control can be defined as follows. Various network users issue online requests for a connection to certain multicast sources. The network either connects this request or rejects it (admission control decision). If request is connected, a path with sufficient bandwidth is established starting at the requesting user and ending either at the source or at one of the users previously connected to the same source (route selection decision). The goal of these admission control and route selection decisions is to maximize total number of users connected (i.e. total thruput) subject to the network capacity constraints. This problem can be reduced to the online maximal dense tree problem: Upon a service request from a node in a weighted graph with a distinguished source, the node is either rejected or connected to the tree of previously connected nodes. The goal is to maximize the total number of requests while keeping the density (ratio of accepted requests to the weight of the spanning tree) sufficiently high. Informally, online maximal dense tree algorithm must "gamble" on certain geographic areas, connecting nodes which are unprofitable to start with, in the hope that enough requests arrive at nodes "near" its path to the root to eventually make the investment profitable. No deterministic algorithm for such a problem can possibly succeed with adversarial input since once online has connected nodes in a certain area, the adversary generating the input will not generate any further demand into the vicinity of this area. This paper presents a randomized online algorithm which guarantees to get 99% of the requests accepted by o*ine with expectation of density being at most poly-logarithmically lower than that of the o*ine. This yields selective multicast algorithm whose thruput is only poly-logarithmically lower than that of o*ine. Previous work on multicast routing and maximal dense tree either made probabilistic assumptions or resulted in linear performance gaps with o*ine.

Reference-contexts: The following partial results have been obtained since then. Special case of a star graph (e.g. video server connected by links of variable weights to a number of clients) is essentially the `winner picking" problem introduced by Awerbuch, Azar, Fiat, and Leighton <ref> [AAFL96] </ref>. In general graph, we can still view maximal dense tree problem as picking online a set of nodes with high density, which falls into the "winner picking" framework of [AAFL96]. <p> variable weights to a number of clients) is essentially the `winner picking" problem introduced by Awerbuch, Azar, Fiat, and Leighton <ref> [AAFL96] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our framework can be generalized to include issues such as pricing policies, network design & synthesis, etc. By constructing a specific metric space defined by edge weights that capture existing network traffic as in <ref> [AAP93] </ref>, we can reduce the problem of admission control (selecting subset of requests that are being granted) and route selection (construction of a spanning multicast tree) to the maximal dense problem. <p> c &gt; 0, and every l &gt; 1, = O (1 c = O ( 16c log n log (n 2 l) fl = O ( nl Suppose that the set of requests admitted for each multicast group is defined by algorithm A as above in the "exponential" metric space <ref> [AAP93] </ref>. Also, suppose that the routing selection is performed along the minimum weight tree spanning the subset of requests accepted and their source. Let l is the number of different multicast groups. <p> The algorithms are presented in Section 2 and their proofs are given in Section 3. 1.4 Relationship to other work The maximal dense tree problem was first formulated in 1992 in an attempt to extend the admission control algorithms in <ref> [AAP93] </ref> to multicast connections, namely pay-per-view video on demand. The following partial results have been obtained since then.

We get Claim 1.3 The gap between thruput of o*ine and the resulting selected multicast grows as at most by O ( 1 + 1 log n + fl l). Proof: an easy modification of the argument in <ref> [Awe96] </ref>. Corollary 1.4 Combined with the reduction in claim 1.3, the algorithm in see Figure 4 yields online selective multicast algorithm whose expected thruput is within O (log 2 n) factor from o*ine, where n is the number of network nodes.
