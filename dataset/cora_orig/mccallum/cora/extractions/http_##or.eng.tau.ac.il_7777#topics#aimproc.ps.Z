Abstract: Manual Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tools are limited in their use and their reuse. Computational tools can alleviate these limitations. In addition, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can further enhance the functionality of QFD tools. A graph-based information representation is proposed as the basis for integrating various QFD and AI tools. An architecture of a computational QFD (CQFD) tool based on the graph-based modeling environment n-dim is briefly discussed. The ideas are illustrated through the design of a cork remover.

Reference-contexts: Grid-based methods are often used by individuals (or by groups, in the same way as QFD 2 tools are). Nevertheless, the information in several grids acquired from several individuals can be analyzed and compared to result in the consensus, conflict, correspondence, or contrast between individuals <ref> (Gaines and Shaw, 1989) </ref>. This process has an effect similar to brainstorming with analytical means for providing guidance and feedback. Subsequent to the comparison of multiple grids, customers and designers can revise and enhance their grid information.

Reference-contexts: There have been studies on the use of conceptual structures for various CAD-related topics such as: mapping the enterprise information language EXPRESS (Wermelinger and Bejan, 1993) and modeling the knowledge interchange format KIF (Sowa, 1993). Since conceptual structures cannot represent uncertainties well, others graph-based models called influence diagrams <ref> (Howard and Matheson, 1983) </ref> can be used to represent probabilistic knowledge for probabilistic inference. Influence diagrams are extensions of Bayesian networks and have been used in artificial intelligence, decision analysis and statistics. Figure 6 depicts an approximate hierarchy of some graph-based models.

Reference-contexts: It is desirable to adapt a tool to make use of such information when it become available. 3) The adaptability category deals with the ease of modifying a tool to suite diverse needs. This is critical considering that Japanese have used more than 80 types of QFD matrices <ref> (King, 1989) </ref>. These adaptations are difficult to perform with paper methods. 4) The communication category deals with the modes in which QFD tools can be used. The use of manual QFD tools requires having good face-to-face (synchronous) communication practices because they are effectively used in group settings.

Reference-contexts: Opportunities for models reuse demonstrate the significant benefits of this approach for capturing enterprise information. These opportunities can benefit from CBR tools that detect parts of previously developed models that are applicable to the present product design. 6 IMPLEMENTATION n-dim <ref> (Levy et al, 1993) </ref> is a system developed to support collaborative design and is based on empirical studies of designers revealing that design is a continual negotiation of constraints, terminology and trade-offs for the creation of a shared understanding of the design process and product (Konda et al, 1992; Subrahmanian et <p> Other candidate tools for encapsulation include inference engines for conceptual structures or influence diagrams and simulators of qualitative physics graphs. An architecture of a CQFD tool. Figure 8 shows the architecture layers of an n-dim-based CQFD tool. All but the top layer are n-dim layers <ref> (Levy et al, 1993) </ref> demonstrating the great advantage of using n-dim as the implementation vehicle.

Reference-contexts: Thus, there is significant concern in industry about quality product design that is addressed, among others, by Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tools including the House of Quality (HoQ) (Akao, 1990; Clauss-ing, 1993; King, 1989) and the seven (new) management tools <ref> (Mizuno, 1988) </ref>. The success of QFD tools is detailed in many recent publications (Akao, 1990; Claussing, 1993; King, 1989).

Reference-contexts: It can be assisted by the use of natural language processing (NLP) tools that can uncover concepts and their relationships by analyzing text. Conceptual differences discovered by analyzing different sources can be inspected to establish a common terminology <ref> (Reich et al, 1993) </ref>. Gradually, common terms and their relationships emerge. They can be represented in graphical forms as seen in Figure 2. Further analysis of the problem can lead to revealing simple structures underlying the problem. <p> External tool encapsulation. n-dim allows to encapsulate external tools written in diverse programming languages and use them in models. One such tool is a natural language processing (NLP) tool that can build terminological structures from a corpora of text <ref> (Reich et al, 1993) </ref>. Another tool allows users to conduct a brainstorming session for eliciting concepts across the network. The development of this tool with n-dim facilities was fairly easy. Other candidate tools for encapsulation include inference engines for conceptual structures or influence diagrams and simulators of qualitative physics graphs.

Reference-contexts: The ability of QFD tools to capture and communicate design rationale is limited when used in an asynchronous manner, whether for communication among members of the current project or for disseminating information into the organization for future reuse. It is clear that computer tools can alleviate these four limitations <ref> (Reich, 1995) </ref>. The key issue is how to integrate the tools such that they maintain the usefulness of the original manual QFD tools. To date, there has been little work done on supporting QFD with techniques beyond spreadsheet (Reich, 1995; Pohl and Jacobs, 1994). <p> These decisions processes are presently lost. Computational tools provide opportunities to structure and maintain these processes and their outcomes. Each decision can be augmented by an IBIS-like (Rittel and Webber, 1973) information structure that maintains the various choices, the arguments for and against each choice, and the resolution <ref> (Reich, 1995) </ref>. Figure 4 displays the definition of such IBIS models. Such an information structure allows to exercise asynchronous communication modes for making decisions (Subrahmanian et al, 1993a) and provides better grounds for understanding decisions at later design stages or in future projects.
