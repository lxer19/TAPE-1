Reference-contexts: This involves the integration of several paradigms: functional and object-oriented computation with relations and retrieval mechanisms. This is beyond NU-Prolog; beyond current object-oriented databases; but supported in theory by the language Life <ref> [1] </ref> provided it is implemented to include persistence or retrieval mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: This heuristic approach is still used to supplement modern algorithmic approaches, such as the Risch algorithm. Richard Fateman at Berkeley is a strong supporter of this heuristic approach and plans a large in-memory database of integrals [11] using automatic acquisition <ref> [2] </ref> of tables of integrals via document recognition. There are about 10,000 printed pages of tables with approximately 5 integrals per page. The use of computers to disseminate group-theoretical data is much more recent: such use began about 1975.

Reference-contexts: This will allow us to research the integration of paradigms, and the variety of retrieval mechanisms needed to support mathematical databases. To this end, we are constructing a C++ framework <ref> [3] </ref>, which initially includes a Datalog interpreter, multi-attribute retrieval mechanisms, and an interpreter for TwoGroups. The idea of object comprehension [9], which provides declarative querying of object-oriented databases, is a natural development from the set comprehension query language of TwoGroups and addresses several extensions that are of interest to us.

Reference-contexts: Computer algebra systems, such as Macsyma, Maple, and Mathe-matica could benefit from other forms of data, such as tables of integrals, or tables of combinatorial identities. The rationale for incorporating facilities for databases and deduction into a computer algebra system, as envisioned by Butler and Cannon <ref> [4] </ref>, is threefold: 1. The number of catalogues of mathematical data is growing, and a common task of an algebraist is to seek examples and counterexamples to conjec tures amongst these catalogues. 2. There has always been a desire to fully utilise the user's knowledge of a problem. 3. <p> This demonstrates the feasibility of providing mathematicians with a familiar language for expressing their queries, and validates the decision of the Cayley project <ref> [4] </ref> to base its query language on set constructors. In particular, TwoGroups has already been used by some mathematicians to aid their research into groups of prime-power order (that is, p-groups). <p> This fundamental importance of simple groups means that their properties and their classification have been intensely investigated. Our prototype knowledge base SmallSimpleGroups investigates the issues in providing this information online, with the eventual aim of integrating the knowledge with the computer algebra system, Cayley <ref> [4] </ref> (which is now called Magma). The SmallSimpleGroups knowledge base [5] contains knowledge about the 56 non-abelian simple groups of order less than one million. The dataset we use is catalogued by John McKay and his colleagues. The dataset is small but very heterogeneous.

The work of O'Brien developed into TwoGroups [6], the first mathematical database, which is presented in a following section. It is relational in style. SmallSimpleGroups <ref> [5] </ref> is the first knowledge base for mathematics, though still experimental. It contains objects, parameterised data, and heuristics. An overview of this system is presented below. Besides the systems for symbolic integration described above, there are other systems which use embedded databases of mathematical information for their application. <p> Our prototype knowledge base SmallSimpleGroups investigates the issues in providing this information online, with the eventual aim of integrating the knowledge with the computer algebra system, Cayley [4] (which is now called Magma).

The data is homogeneous and, with a few exceptions, consists of small integers. These exceptions can also be encoded as integers. Hence, the data conforms to the requirements of traditional relational databases.

Reference-contexts: These include complex objects, user-defined functions, and query optimisation. We are investigating incorporating object comprehension and the related object data model into the C++ framework as a basis for the re-implementation of SmallSimpleGroups. Current collaboration with Calmet's team at Karl-sruhe aims at incorporating the components of Mantra <ref> [7] </ref>, a system for hybrid knowledge representation and reasoning (written in Common Lisp), into the C++ framework. This will support research on knowledge-bases for mathematics. 7 Conclusion Mathematics is a new area of advanced applications for database technology.

Simple groups are the building blocks from which all groups are constructed, just as all integers are constructed from prime numbers. This fundamental importance of simple groups means that their properties and their classification have been intensely investigated.

Reference-contexts: There was no such feedback for Small-SimpleGroups, and it was a much more challenging task which would have benefitted greatly from external encouragement. Major concerns of the user community were not new, but reiterated the issues common to users of scientific databases <ref> [12] </ref>, namely a great concern for the accuracy and correctness of data; the integrity of data; a clear and precise record of the provenance of data, with proper accreditation for authors and collectors of data. TwoGroups was originally developed on the NU-Prolog platform.

Reference-contexts: They use data about groups, mostly simple groups H, to count the number of epimorphisms from G to H. They do not query the collection of data, but use it as a table.

Reference-contexts: The data includes lists of prime numbers, the digits of , tables of integrals or combinatorial identities, or tables of function values such as statistical distributions.

Initially the data was computed by hand, for example by difference tables of logarithms. The importance of the numerical data for science and the military greatly influenced the development of computing, and now much of the data can be readily calculated by machine.

Reference-contexts: It contains objects, parameterised data, and heuristics. An overview of this system is presented below. Besides the systems for symbolic integration described above, there are other systems which use embedded databases of mathematical information for their application. The first example is the heuristic approach of Holt and Rees <ref> [16] </ref> for determining whether two groups, G1 and G2, are isomorphic. They use data about groups, mostly simple groups H, to count the number of epimorphisms from G to H. They do not query the collection of data, but use it as a table.

Reference-contexts: The data is homogeneous and, with a few exceptions, consists of small integers. These exceptions can also be encoded as integers.

The database is built using the NU-Prolog implementation platform <ref> [20] </ref> which provides the inference engine, a translator for definite-clause grammars which constructs a parser written in Prolog, and a partial match retrieval scheme, called SIMC, for external databases. SIMC is based on superimposed codewords and provides multi key access at both the segment and record levels. <p> The knowledge may include heuristics for solving a particular class of queries. Our aim is to explore the representation and the querying of this diverse dataset with the NU-Prolog implementation platform <ref> [20] </ref>, which provides relational and deductive database facilities, as well as a logic programming environment.
