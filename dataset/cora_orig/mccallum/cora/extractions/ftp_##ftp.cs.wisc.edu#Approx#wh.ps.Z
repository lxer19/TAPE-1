Abstract: We study Weyl-Heisenberg (=Gabor) expansions for either L 2 (IR d ) or a subspace of it. These X = (E k M l ' : k 2 K; l 2 L; ' 2 ); where K and L are some discrete lattices in IR d , L 2 (IR d ) is finite, E is the translation operator, and M is the modulation operator. Such sets X are known as WH systems. The analysis of the "basis" properties of WH systems (e.g. being a frame or a Riesz basis) is our central topic, with the fiberization-decomposition techniques of shift-invariant systems, developed in a previous paper of us, being the main tool. Of particular interest is the notion of the adjoint of a WH set, and the duality principle which characterizes a WH (tight) frame in term of the stability (orthonormality) of its adjoint. The actions of passing to the adjoint and passing to the dual system commute, hence the dual WH frame can be computed via the dual basis of the adjoint. Estimates for the underlying frame/basis bounds are obtained by two different methods. The Gramian analysis applies to all WH systems, albeit provides estimates that might be quite crude. This approach is invoked to show how, under only mild conditions on X, a frame can be obtained by oversampling a Bessel set. Finally, finer estimates of the frame bounds, based on the Zak transform, are expansions in terms of the spanning set

Reference-contexts: Frames were introduced in [DS] in the context of non-harmonic Fourier series. Frames for L 2 (IR) were quite extensively studied in the literature, with the focus being on two special choices: wavelet (or affine) frames, and Weyl-Heisenberg (or short-windowed Fourier transform) frames. We refer to the surveys <ref> [BW] </ref>, [HW] and [D1], the books [C] and [D2], and to the references therein for discussions of frames, and in particular wavelet and Weyl-Heisenberg frames. 1.2. Weyl-Heisenberg systems defined A Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) system is defined here with respect to a pair of lattices. <p> Roughly speaking, it shows that the actions of taking adjoint and taking dual commute. In phrasing this result, we already took advantage of the well-known (and simple) fact that the dual system of a PWH frame (K; L) ' is of the form (K; L) (cf. Theorem 3.2 of <ref> [BW] </ref>), i.e., is also a PWH system. This means that the notion of "the adjoint (R X X) fl of the dual system R X X of X" is well-defined for every PWH system X. Theorem 2.3. <p> Corollary 2.5. A self-adjoint X is a fundamental frame if and only if it is a Riesz basis. This property follows directly from (e) of Theorem 2.2. The "only if" implication is well-known (cf. Theorem 3.7 of <ref> [BW] </ref> which contains a proof of that implication for cartesian lattices). Another conclusion, whose univariate case can be found in p. 81 of [D2], is as follows. Corollary 2.6. Let X be a normalized fundamental PWH frame. <p> Furthermore, lim n!1 n kT X n j n = denX A: Proof: We prove only the case when F := f'( l)g l2 e L is a Riesz basis. For that, set A (s; ) := l2L It is well-known (cf. e.g. [RS1], <ref> [BW] </ref>), that F being a Riesz basis (or frame) is equivalent here to the following two conditions: (i): b fi (0) &lt; 1 (which is equivalent to F being a Bessel system), and (ii): bff (0) := ess inf IR d A (0; ) &gt; 0: (for frame: bff (0) := <p> The study of F := (E ff ') ff2ZZ d as a potential basis for S (') is the simplest among all studies of shift-invariant bases (cf. [RS1], <ref> [BW] </ref> and the references therein). Up to some technicalities, a function f 2 S (') is identified by the restriction of its Fourier transform to [0; 2] d , hence the rest of its Fourier transform values are somewhat "redundant" information. <p> Also, (by Theorem 2.2.7 of [RS1]; see also x7 of <ref> [BW] </ref>) Y is a frame if and only if e' K is bounded above and below on its support Y , and the frame bounds are (3:2) jKj k e' K k 2 L 1 (Y ) : This yields, in view of Corollary 3.1, that the frame bounds of X

Weyl-Heisenberg systems defined A Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) system is defined here with respect to a pair of lattices. <p> It is known that the univariate analog of Corollary 2.7 does not require X to be a frame, only a fundamental set. However, the simple argument for the univariate case (that appears in p. 978 of <ref> [D1] </ref>) applies only to the case when denX is rational (which is the univariate counterpart of what we call here compressible PWH systems, see x4, particularly Corollary 4.7). The original proof of this result for a general low-density invoked involved results from [R]. <p> Since results analogous to some of those statements can be found in <ref> [D1] </ref> and in [TO2], it is worth mentioning here a difference between the results in the aforementioned references and the estimates provided by Gramian analysis. <p> Then, in general, the condition B 1 := i2I is stronger than the condition B 2 := sup i2I Furthermore, one usually has B 2 &lt; B 1 . The results and estimates of <ref> [D1] </ref> and [TO2] are based on the finiteness and "smallness" of quantities defined as B 1 above, while our results below are based on quantities defined similarly to the number B 2 above, and thus are finer than their univariate counterparts in the literature. <p> An interesting application of Gramian analysis, that is fully detailed here, is connected to the idea of oversampling, when one increases the density of X in order to stabilize the system. This idea appears, for example, in [FG] and <ref> [D1] </ref> (see also [D2]), and its particular implementation here is as follows: let X = (K; L) ' be a WH-system. Suppose that we fix L and ', but vary the volume of K. As K becomes denser, X is more likely to become a frame. <p> In that case, one requires f b'( ff)g ff2ZZ d to be orthonormal, defines the function fi with respect to ' instead of b', and proceeds by oversampling the modulations rather than the translations. Again, the construction in <ref> [D1] </ref> can be viewed as a particular instance of that strategy. Indeed, in case d = 1, the following result is intimately related to Theorems 2.5 and 2.6 of [D1]. Theorem 2.14. Let X := (K; L) ' be a Bessel system. <p> Again, the construction in <ref> [D1] </ref> can be viewed as a particular instance of that strategy. Indeed, in case d = 1, the following result is intimately related to Theorems 2.5 and 2.6 of [D1]. Theorem 2.14. Let X := (K; L) ' be a Bessel system. <p> In fact, the same applies to sup-adjoint system generated by several functions: in all these cases the dual Gramian can be compressed into a single function, a function which, in a univariate setup, was already put into good use in <ref> [D1] </ref> (being the way Daubechies derives her "exact bounds", cf. p. 982 of [D1]). Due to the duality principle, the analysis of PWH sup-adjoint systems extends to their adjoint systems, termed here as sub-adjoint. (d) Compressible WH systems. This is the most general case our Zak transform analysis applies to. <p> same applies to sup-adjoint system generated by several functions: in all these cases the dual Gramian can be compressed into a single function, a function which, in a univariate setup, was already put into good use in <ref> [D1] </ref> (being the way Daubechies derives her "exact bounds", cf. p. 982 of [D1]). Due to the duality principle, the analysis of PWH sup-adjoint systems extends to their adjoint systems, termed here as sub-adjoint. (d) Compressible WH systems. This is the most general case our Zak transform analysis applies to. <p> This fact is well-known in the univariate case (cf. p. 976 of <ref> [D1] </ref>) and extends to the multivariate case with no difficulty. <p> The univariate counterpart of (a) and (b) of this result is known and can be found e.g., in <ref> [D1] </ref>. 18 Theorem 2.20. Let X = (K; L) , L 2 finite, e K L. <p> Consequently, X is a Bessel system if either ' is sufficiently smooth or decays sufficiently fast. Literature Discussion. We compare the f -estimate in (a) of Theorem 3.21 to Theorem 2.6 of <ref> [D1] </ref> and Theorem 2 of [TO2]. Theorem 2.6 of [D1] contains an estimate of the upper frame bound for a univariate X in terms of ' rather than b'. <p> Consequently, X is a Bessel system if either ' is sufficiently smooth or decays sufficiently fast. Literature Discussion. We compare the f -estimate in (a) of Theorem 3.21 to Theorem 2.6 of <ref> [D1] </ref> and Theorem 2 of [TO2]. Theorem 2.6 of [D1] contains an estimate of the upper frame bound for a univariate X in terms of ' rather than b'. After making that necessary switch, we find that it employs quantities of the form k P l2L jE s+l f E l f j k 1 . <p> However, these norms are not summed up directly, but rather are grouped into pairs, with respect to which a geometric average is computed, hence altogether Theorem 2.6 of <ref> [D1] </ref> is not comparable to our results here. <p> Literature Discussion cont'ed. Theorem 2.5 of <ref> [D1] </ref> provides a sufficient condition for a uni-variate system to be a fundamental frame. The condition is based on the positivity of (a slightly coarser expression than) the quantity inf A L b'(0; ) k2 e Kn0 and thus the condition given in Theorem 3.27 is somewhat better. <p> Indeed, the fact that passing to the adjoint amounts, up to a multiplicative constant, to an interchange between the two basic matrices is the essence of the duality principle. Remark. Zibulski and Zeevi, [ZZ], as well as, implicitly, Daubechies, <ref> [D1] </ref>, employ the Zak transform in order to decompose univariate systems of rational density. In particular, [ZZ] employs two matrices, S and G, which correspond to, yet look quite different from, our dual Zak matrix, and pre-Zak matrix. <p> The univariate case of this result can be found in <ref> [D1] </ref>, and was proved there by a similar argument. Corollary 4.7. Let X = (K; L) be a compressible WH system. Then X is fundamental only if den X 1. Finally, we consider the problem of computing the dual frame of X = (K; L) .

By the duality principle, this is equivalent to constructing a Riesz basis ( e L; e K) ' .

The flavour of the results there is quite different: wavelet sets are not shift-invariant, and the main effort of [RS3] is to show that, nevertheless, the basic analysis of [RS1] does apply to that case as well. Let X L 2 (IR d ). We consider X as a possible "basis" set for L 2 (IR d ), or for some closed subspace of it. <p> In x2.2 we describe the three Gramian matrices that underly our fiberization techniques and recall the main results of <ref> [RS1] </ref>. That already allows us to provide a simple and complete proof of the duality principle. Furthermore, it shows how the Wexler-Raz identity, [DLL], can be equivalently formulated (thereby proved) as a matrix identity. <p> For these systems, the Gramian matrices are realized as arrays (of finite order) of convolution operators. It should be understood that the goal of this paper is the application of the fiberization techniques of <ref> [RS1] </ref> to WH systems. This means that we consistently strive to explain the various phenomena of the WH systems via the Gramian matrices, even when a direct course is available as well (such as in the case of Zak transform analysis). 1.4. <p> the three articles [J], [DLL], and ours as "simultaneous and independent", and it is worth mentioning that the techniques employed in these papers are quite different: [J] amplifies the approach of Tolimieri and Orr, [DLL] invokes what they call "the Wexler-Raz identity", while our development follows the fiberization techniques of <ref> [RS1] </ref>. We decided to abstain from expanding our paper in directions that may be suggested from the reading of [J] and [DLL], with the following single exception: in x3.3, we show how the Wexler-Raz identity can be observed by using our decomposition-fiberization techniques. <p> It is probably true that no significant simplification of arguments would have occurred, had we chosen to restrict attention to univariate systems. In contrast, the treatment of non-fundamental systems seems to be harder than their fundamental counterparts, at least from the standpoint of the tools we borrowed from <ref> [RS1] </ref> for either case. 2. Fiberization of WH systems and selected applications 2.1. The duality principle We start our discussion here with the introduction of the (new) notion of the adjoint of the PWH system (K; L) ' . <p> Fiberization and the Gramian matrices Let X = (K; L) be a WH system (, say, finite). Then, X is K-shift-invariant, in the sense that each of the shift operators E k : f 7! f ( + k); k 2 K maps X 1-1 onto itself. The reference <ref> [RS1] </ref> suggests, for a general K-shift-invariant X, the study of T X and T fl X via a decomposition process of these two operators into a collection of "fiber" operators that are simpler for analysis. <p> For that purpose, we consider the set X as the collection of all K-shifts of the set L := fe l ' : ' 2 ; l 2 Lg: The basic object in the approach of <ref> [RS1] </ref> was the pre-Gramian matrix J := J X . <p> At this point, the discussion can be advanced in two different complementary ways. The first, which we present here, fully invokes the fiberization results of <ref> [RS1] </ref>. Roughly speaking, these results imply that the basic norm bounds of T X can be computed via a separate inspection of each fiber J X (w) of J X . This, when combined with (2.10), will provide an immediate proof for almost all statements in Theorem 2.2. <p> We turn now to a brief discussion of the core of the <ref> [RS1] </ref> observations. For that, we consider each (more precisely, almost each) G (w) as a densely defined operator from ` 2 (L ) into itself, and, similarly, each e G (w) as a densely defined operator from ` 2 ( e K) into itself. <p> The pertinent result here, which is stated below, follows from Corollary 3.2.2, Theorem 3.3.5 and Theorem 3.4.1 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>. 10 Theorem 2.12. Let X be a WH system as above, associated with a Gramian G and a dual Gramian e G. Consider the following functions (if G (w) is the 0-operator, we define its partial inverse to be 0, too. <p> At this point our decomposition techniques are employed: the analysis part of Lemma 4.1 of <ref> [RS1] </ref> asserts that almost each of the corresponding fiber operators is an orthogonal projector, (2.10) then converts that property to the fibers of the corresponding adjoint systems, and the synthesis part of that Lemma 4.1 is then invoked to conclude that (up to the right multiplicative constant) T fl X fl <p> However, that, in general, does not imply that Y fl is the dual frame of X fl , until one verifies that X fl and Y fl span the same subspace of L 2 (IR d ) (cf. Corollary 1.3.9 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>). The fact that X fl and Y fl , indeed, span the same space follows from the fact that the kernels of the synthesis operators of two dual systems (viz. X and Y ) are identical (Proposition 1.3.7 of [RS1]). <p> Corollary 1.3.9 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>). The fact that X fl and Y fl , indeed, span the same space follows from the fact that the kernels of the synthesis operators of two dual systems (viz. X and Y ) are identical (Proposition 1.3.7 of [RS1]). However, the entire argument sketched above, including all missing details, had already been detailed in Corollary 4.4 of [RS1], which, as a matter of fact, was tailored there for the proof of Theorem 2.3. <p> X and Y ) are identical (Proposition 1.3.7 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>). However, the entire argument sketched above, including all missing details, had already been detailed in Corollary 4.4 of [RS1], which, as a matter of fact, was tailored there for the proof of Theorem 2.3. All we need here is to carefully compute the constants that arise when converting the shift-invariant setup of that corollary from the lattice ZZ d to general lattices. Proof of Theorem 2.3. <p> of J X fl as (den X) 1=2 J fl X : With RX the dual frame of X, our definition of 0 and Y imply also that J Y = (denX) 1=2 J fl RX : This establishes the relation we need for the application of Corollary 4.4 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>, with the following additional remark: the corollary assumes the underlying systems to be ZZ d -shift-invariant, hence requires relations such as J X J fl RX = J fl X fl J Y . <p> Furthermore, lim n!1 n kT X n j n = denX A: Proof: We prove only the case when F := f'( l)g l2 e L is a Riesz basis. For that, set A (s; ) := l2L It is well-known (cf. e.g. <ref> [RS1] </ref>, [BW]), that F being a Riesz basis (or frame) is equivalent here to the following two conditions: (i): b fi (0) &lt; 1 (which is equivalent to F being a Bessel system), and (ii): bff (0) := ess inf IR d A (0; ) &gt; 0: (for frame: bff (0) <p> (0) &lt; 1 (which is equivalent to F being a Bessel system), and (ii): bff (0) := ess inf IR d A (0; ) &gt; 0: (for frame: bff (0) := ess inf (F ) A (0; ) &gt; 0; where (F ) is the spectrum of F ; cf. <ref> [RS1] </ref> for details). It is furthermore known that the frame bounds of F are B = kT F k 2 = b fi (0)=j e Lj and A = kT F Define K n := K=n. <p> Here, 0=0 := 0. More discussion along these lines is given near the end of this section, when we compare sub-adjoint systems to PSI spaces (in this regard, compare, also, (b) in the corollary below to Theorem 2.2.16 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>). Corollary 2.22. Let X be the sup-adjoint WH system (K; L) , with dual Zak function e Z X , whose support is (X). <p> The study of F := (E ff ') ff2ZZ d as a potential basis for S (') is the simplest among all studies of shift-invariant bases (cf. <ref> [RS1] </ref>, [BW] and the references therein). Up to some technicalities, a function f 2 S (') is identified by the restriction of its Fourier transform to [0; 2] d , hence the rest of its Fourier transform values are somewhat "redundant" information. <p> We define the WH spectrum of X to be the support (X) e K fi L of Z X . The generator of the dual frame of X can be found exactly as in the PSI case (cf. (2.2.13) in <ref> [RS1] </ref>), that is, it can be computed fiber by fiber: Z L b := Z L b'=Z X ; with the division carried out only on the WH spectrum of X (more precisely, on the L-periodization of that spectrum; one should be somewhat careful here, since Z L b' has L <p> The analogy goes on and on. For example, a suitable unitary transformation which maps ` 2 (X) onto L 2 ( e K fi L ) maps ker T X onto L 2 ( e K n (X); L ) (compare with (2.2.8) and its previous display in <ref> [RS1] </ref>). Our final discussion in this section concerns with oversampling and undersampling of WH systems: Each sup-adjoint system can be realized as the result of oversampling a self-adjoint one, and each sub-adjoint system can be realized as the result of undersampling a self-adjoint system. <p> Also, (by Theorem 2.2.7 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>; see also x7 of [BW]) Y is a frame if and only if e' K is bounded above and below on its support Y , and the frame bounds are (3:2) jKj k e' K k 2 L 1 (Y ) : This yields, in view of Corollary 3.1, that <p> Indeed, the orthogonality between the e L-shifts of ' implies that the function that generates the dual frame of Y generates also the entire dual frame of X fl . The simplification is then due to the fact that computing the dual frame of Y is relatively easy (cf. <ref> [RS1] </ref>. The special case of a Riesz basis is well-known). The generator of the dual frame of Y is the function := jKj e' 2 ; with the understanding that 0=0 := 0. This function generates the dual frame of Y , hence the dual frame of X fl . <p> A complete discussion of that point (in a more general setup), including the issue of well-definedness of these operators can be found in x1 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>. In x2, we had circumvented entirely that point, and invoked instead the ready-to-use Theorem 2.12. However, for the sake of the present development, we need at least a basic grasp of that representation. All WH systems considered in the present subsection are assumed to be Bessel. <p> (w; e k) := b f (w + e k): Interpreting J X as the operator J X : L 2 ( e K ; L) ! L 2 ( e K ; e K); defined by (J X t )(w; ) := J X (w)t (w; ); it follows, <ref> [RS1] </ref>, that (3:12) U 2 T X = J X U 1 ; hence that also (3:13) U 1 T fl X U 2 : However, it will be erroneous to conclude, in view of the above and (2.10), that we had established an operator relation between, say, T X fl <p> For the satisfaction of these latter requirements, we will assume that all our WH systems are Bessel, and will invoke Theorem 3.2.3 of <ref> [RS1] </ref> which rigorously justifies the matrix manipulations we employ. Theorem 3.19 [WR], [DLL]. Let X = (K; L) ' , Y = (K; L) , Z = (K; L) g be three WH systems. Assume that X fl , Y , Z, (and Z fl ) are Bessel. <p> The arguments that lead to such estimates are only sketched. In any event, these are straightforward arguments which were already discussed in more detail (and in a more general context) in x1.6 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>. For the simplicity of the presentation, we will consider only the case of a singleton . The extension to a finite is mainly notational. <p> The critical information required is that basic operations (such as finding image and kernel of operators, describing orthogonal projectors, computing dual system, etc.) can be performed fiber by fiber. For FSI spaces, this was done in x2 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>; the techniques, however, apply to general fiberization with finite-dimensional fibers, hence to our present case of interest. 33 We introduce a new type of "inner product", the Zak product, of which the function e Z X that was used in the context of the sup-adjoint case is a special "diagonal" <p> We will then form finite-order matrices (the Zak matrix and the dual Zak matrix) whose entries are such Zak products. These matrices may replace the infinite order Gramian matrices, and we reach that reduction by employing either of the two arguments: (a) direct adaptation of the FSI techniques of <ref> [RS1] </ref> to WH setup here; or (b) adaptation of the FSI techniques in order to fiberize further the (already partially fiberized) Gramian operator, and then invoking Theorem 2.12. <p> These latter relations were analysed in detail in several references, with the most comprehensive results contained in [BDR] and <ref> [RS1] </ref>. In particular, the arguments used to establish Theorem 2.3.6 of [RS1], when transported to the new setup here, lead to the following result. Lemma 4.3. <p> These latter relations were analysed in detail in several references, with the most comprehensive results contained in [BDR] and <ref> [RS1] </ref>. In particular, the arguments used to establish Theorem 2.3.6 of [RS1], when transported to the new setup here, lead to the following result. Lemma 4.3. <p> Again, the arguments used in Theorem 2.3.6 of <ref> [RS1] </ref> apply here, and lead to a result analogous to Lemma 4.3, that connects now the fl -functions to the G fl -functions. This, in view of Theorem 2.12, leads to following theorem. Theorem 4.5. Let X be a compressible WH system (K; L) . <p> Though Theorem 2 in [ZZ] is stated without proof, the supporting discussion there provides an almost complete argument. The only missing ingredient in the approach of [ZZ] is its sought-for unitary diagonalization (14), which, incidentally, is proved in <ref> [RS1] </ref> as Lemma 2.3.5. Corollary 4.6. Let X be a compressible WH system with Zak matrix Z X and dual Zak matrix e Z X . <p> In fact, as is already established in Theorem 1 of [ZZ], the frame property of X is irrelevant here: By invoking Lemma 2.3.5 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>, we may unitarily diagonalize e Z X , using a unitary matrix with measurable entries. <p> Thus, finding P Z Y (w; t) here is a standard finite-dimensional least squares problem, and we obtain that (4:8) P Z Y (w; t) = Z 1 38 (compare with Theorem 2.4.7 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The statement in (b) is actually valid even when X is not Bessel, if one defines then appropriately the notion of a "basis". Finally, note that the roles of X and X fl in the theorem can certainly be interchanged (since X flfl = X). Remark. The paper <ref> [TO2] </ref> precedes us in observing the connection (in the univariate setup) between a set (pZZ; 2qZZ) ' and (ZZ=q; 2ZZ=p) ' . The univariate case of part (f) of Theorem 2.2 can already be found in that reference. <p> Since results analogous to some of those statements can be found in [D1] and in <ref> [TO2] </ref>, it is worth mentioning here a difference between the results in the aforementioned references and the estimates provided by Gramian analysis. That difference may be easily understood by the following illustration: suppose that (f i ) i2I is a collection of functions defined on some common domain A. <p> Then, in general, the condition B 1 := i2I is stronger than the condition B 2 := sup i2I Furthermore, one usually has B 2 &lt; B 1 . The results and estimates of [D1] and <ref> [TO2] </ref> are based on the finiteness and "smallness" of quantities defined as B 1 above, while our results below are based on quantities defined similarly to the number B 2 above, and thus are finer than their univariate counterparts in the literature. <p> Consequently, X is a Bessel system if either ' is sufficiently smooth or decays sufficiently fast. Literature Discussion. We compare the f -estimate in (a) of Theorem 3.21 to Theorem 2.6 of [D1] and Theorem 2 of <ref> [TO2] </ref>. Theorem 2.6 of [D1] contains an estimate of the upper frame bound for a univariate X in terms of ' rather than b'. <p> However, these norms are not summed up directly, but rather are grouped into pairs, with respect to which a geometric average is computed, hence altogether Theorem 2.6 of [D1] is not comparable to our results here. As to Theorem 2 of <ref> [TO2] </ref>, rewriting it in terms of b' rather than ', its sufficient condition for the Bessel property of the univariate X is the finiteness of P l2L ka l k ` 1 , with a l the Fourier coefficients of A L b'(l; ). <p> In any event, both conditions are based on very coarse estimates. The comparison of Theorem 3.27 to the lower bound estimate provided in Theorem 7 of <ref> [TO2] </ref> is similar. As stated several times before, the "basis" (K; L) ' satisfies the same properties as its Fourier transform set (L; K) b' . This means that all the above estimates are valid with ' replacing b' and K, L interchanging roles. 4. Detailed Zak transform analysis 4.1.

Reference-contexts: After receiving a copy of [RS2], Meir Zibulski from the Technion, Israel, had brought to our attention the articles [TO1,2] and <ref> [ZZ] </ref>. The former establishes the univariate equivalent of part (f) of Theorem 2.2, while the latter derives the univariate equivalents of part (a,b) of Theorem 4.5, as well as of some other results from x4. <p> In this section we overview this approach, and provide the complete details in x4. The Zak transform enters the discussion naturally, as the symbol of the relevant convolution operator. As already mentioned in the introduction, the reference <ref> [ZZ] </ref> contains, in the univariate setup, results which are equivalent to some of the results obtained here in this direction. In the context of the duality principle, we discussed various types of WH systems that admit special properties, for example, a self-adjoint system. <p> Indeed, the fact that passing to the adjoint amounts, up to a multiplicative constant, to an interchange between the two basic matrices is the essence of the duality principle. Remark. Zibulski and Zeevi, <ref> [ZZ] </ref>, as well as, implicitly, Daubechies, [D1], employ the Zak transform in order to decompose univariate systems of rational density. In particular, [ZZ] employs two matrices, S and G, which correspond to, yet look quite different from, our dual Zak matrix, and pre-Zak matrix. <p> Remark.

In particular, [ZZ] employs two matrices, S and G, which correspond to, yet look quite different from, our dual Zak matrix, and pre-Zak matrix. However, the difference can be simply attributed to a different choice of a basis for ` 2 () or ` 2 (). <p> On the other hand, the <ref> [ZZ] </ref>-matrices are related to choosing the characters of the dual group as the relevant basis. Since both choices are orthonormal, our dual Zak matrix here is unitarily equivalent to the S matrix of [ZZ]. In order to convert the analysis of the "basis set" X from the infinite-order Gramian matrices to the finite order Zak matrices, we need to know how to relate the functions that appear in Theorem 2.12 (G, G fl , etc.) to the Zak matrices. <p> Then X is a frame if and only if fl Xj 2 L 1 ((X)).
