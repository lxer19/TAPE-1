Reference-contexts: Qsim models are constraint-based. Typically, a single constraint will correspond to a single component.

Reference-contexts: The vm program [Fagan et al., 1984] extended the coverage of mycin style rules by mapping quantitative measurements into qualitative categories: (very low j low j acceptable j high j very high.) Work in automated diagnosis during the 1970's used numerous approaches to knowledge representation, (see Brachman and Levesque <ref> [Brachman and Lesveque, 1985] </ref> for a collection reviewing such approaches.) Many of these works shared an underlying representation that was (or was equivalent to) as set of rules of the form IF Predicate1 (Object1) THEN Predicate2 (Object2) Such representation came to be called associative representation [Brachman and Lesveque, 1985, p 95]. <p> representation, (see Brachman and Levesque [Brachman and Lesveque, 1985] for a collection reviewing such approaches.)

Although the associative representation proved powerful at recognizing combinations of faults whose manifestations had been individually entered into the knowledge base, it dealt less well with any faults displaying novel symptoms. By the end of the 1970's, associative representations had proven their worth.

Reference-contexts: A rulebase about a mechanism is, in some sense, a model of the mechanism. Other detailed models of mechanisms exist in comput 15 ers: design information, data bases, simulation models. Chandrasekaran and Mittal <ref> [Chandrasekaran and Mittal, 1982] </ref> noted that it would be desirable to combine such representations, so that the knowledge necessary for diagnosis would be derivable in some natural way from (and consistent with) the other extant models; Davis and Genesereth made similar suggestions.

Reference-contexts: Waltz filtering and pairwise constraint satisfaction are not powerful enough to use this information; qsim represents these higher order derivatives as algebraic expressions and uses a small automatic algebra system to solve them, [Dalle Molle, 1989a] [Kuipers and Chiu, 1987] <ref> [Chiu, 1988] </ref> [Kuipers et al., 1991].

Reference-contexts: This is not a good representation of such costs. An additional difficulty in the associative representation of numerical information occurs when evidence conflicts. When multiple lines of evidence are joined, they must be arbitrated together, <ref> [Cohen, 1985] </ref>; the reasoning system must detect if the evidence agrees or conflicts and must synthesize the multiple lines of evidence into a single judgment. Emycin supplied certainty factors as a general procedure for resolving conflicting evidence about discrete variables; later work advanced other such methods.

Reference-contexts: The research that has considered continuous mechanisms has, for the most part, either studied mechanisms in which the variable values could be calculated directly, or it has discretized the continuous variables, (although see the discussions of the works of D'Ambrosio, <ref> [D'Ambrosio, 1990] </ref>, and Patil, [Patil, 1981], [Patil et al., 1984], below.) 22 2.3.3.1 Fault Models in Hypothesis Generation A fault model is a model of how something behaves when it is faulty. <p> But the path followed is the same. Other methods of variable identification might be used at this point, if another method for generating variable estimates is available, (see D'Ambrosio <ref> [D'Ambrosio, 1990] </ref> for a discussion of generating variable estimates using heuristics. We prefer the approach of generating linear models for two reasons. It allows us to ground our variable estimates in our knowledge of component behavior.

Reference-contexts: Many ai researchers built diagnostic systems which used explicit models of the mechanisms they analyzed. In 1986, Davis gave an overview of this work in an invited talk at aaai, (later revised with Hamscher and issued as <ref> [Davis and Hamscher, 1988] </ref>.) This body of work was referred to in different ways; much of the early work was called "diagnosis from first principals," [Davis, 1985] [Genesereth, 1985] [Reiter, 1987]. <p> see Norman in the same volume, [Norman, 1983].) To quote Davis and Hamscher again, "A fundamental presumption behind model-based reasoning for diagnosis is the notion that if the model is correct, all the discrepancies between observation and prediction arise from (and can be traced back to) defects in the device," <ref> [Davis and Hamscher, 1988] </ref>. <p> We speak to the implications of this tacit definition in Chapter 3. 2.3.3 Generate and Test Model-based diagnosis uses generate-and-test [Newell, 1973] to explain unexpected behavior in mechanisms. It generates hypothesis by some suitable means, and uses 21 a model (or models) to test them, <ref> [Davis and Hamscher, 1988] </ref>. Both the generation and the testing phases may be subdivided, and the phases can be interleaved. Variables may also be discrete, i.e., have a domain of a relatively small number of symbolic values, one of which is the nominal value. <p> This section will discuss the criteria by which we judge the suitability of a generation method for a particular diagnostic task, and then discuss several popular methods of hypothesis generation. Davis and Hamscher <ref> [Davis and Hamscher, 1988] </ref> remind us that it is desirable that methods for hypothesis generation have several properties. <p> The constraint suspension provides a quick filter that makes the generation more informed. Simmons and Davis [Simmons and Davis, 1987] describe a system in which the dependency records, in addition to directing the hypothesis generation, guide the debugging of hypotheses that are rejected when tested. Davis and Hamscher <ref> [Davis and Hamscher, 1988] </ref> provide a good description of dependency backchaining and constraint suspension, and offer this caution, The power of hypothesis testing and its ability to infer symptoms are dependent on the power of the propagation machinery. <p> It would have been unlikely that this particular set of inputs would have been picked to generate an input (and remember, a test of "low sodium" wouldn't have generated the behavior; it would have had to have been "drastically low sodium.") Davis and Hamscher <ref> [Davis and Hamscher, 1988] </ref> observe that decision trees, a related technology, suffer a similar shortcoming. Model-based reasoning is able to explain novel behaviors at the mechanism level because it can generate them from the well-understood behaviors of individual components. <p> Problems involving either of these phenomenon require solving several constraints simultaneously. Section 2.3.4.2 discussed how local propagation schemes fail to solve such problems; recall the comment there from Davis and Hamscher <ref> [Davis and Hamscher, 1988] </ref> which described how current constraint systems fail because of their `local' propagation methods.

Reference-contexts: Such programs, (such as mycin, [Shortliffe, 1976] and prospector [Gaschnig, 1979]) showed impressive power, but they proved to be difficult to modify and gave poor results on problems containing novel faults or features that had not been specifically encoded into the knowledge base. The Emycin <ref> [Davis et al., 1984] </ref> program further separated the domain knowledge from the inference capability; this made it easier to extend the knowledge base but underscored the difficulties inherent in encoding all diagnostic knowledge as associations between symbols.

Reference-contexts: He titled this call the Naive Physics Manifesto. 2.2.1 Drawbacks of Associative Models for Diagnosis Many researchers heeded Hayes' call. As they built novel knowledge encodings they began to notice other shortcomings of the associative representations, both from a theoretical view and a practical one. Randall Davis <ref> [Davis, 1985] </ref> articulated several such drawbacks. Associative systems encode knowledge about faults that have been observed, or at least been explicitly anticipated. Experts have (hopefully) seen all of the faults that a particular mechanism manifests; their experience can be captured in the form of If/Then rules. <p> Because it had proven difficult to encode complex mechanisms in associative representations, researchers began using more robust models to build automated diagnostic systems. Realizing that associative representations 18 usually captured only empirical associations between the inputs and the outputs of components of mechanism, Davis <ref> [Davis, 1985] </ref> proposed reasoning directly from components' structure. This approach, of reasoning from first principles, replaces the associative descriptions of components with constraint sets. This work also showed a clean separation of hypothesis generation from hypothesis testing. <p> This approach, of reasoning from first principles, replaces the associative descriptions of components with constraint sets. This work also showed a clean separation of hypothesis generation from hypothesis testing. Davis showed that such an approach could produce correct diagnoses of "bugs that display novel symptoms," (p. 390 in <ref> [Davis, 1985] </ref>.) He also observed that a model-based approach is more easily modified as the domain changes. In the early 1980's, work in automated diagnosis focused on ways of achieving better competence in the knowledge representation. <p> In 1986, Davis gave an overview of this work in an invited talk at aaai, (later revised with Hamscher and issued as [Davis and Hamscher, 1988].) This body of work was referred to in different ways; much of the early work was called "diagnosis from first principals," <ref> [Davis, 1985] </ref> [Genesereth, 1985] [Reiter, 1987]. In time, the modeling issues in such work came to the fore, and the use of models was seen to be important in other automated reasoning tasks beside diagnosis. <p> As Davis points out, "Inference is `free,' while measurement is often quite expensive. : : : It's well worth it to `think as much as you can' before taking another mea surement," <ref> [Davis, 1985] </ref>. * Model-based diagnosis is generate-and-test. Different aspects of the model may be used in the generation and testing phase.

Reference-contexts: Further, it only poorly captures the relationships among the components that make up the mechanism, and it is through these components that causal events flow, connecting faults to the observable behavior. DeKleer and Brown <ref> [de Kleer and Brown, 1984] </ref> and Klein and Finin [Klein and Finin, 1987] note that this descriptive failure leads to diagnostic systems that are "unable to deal with circumstances even slightly different than those explicitly anticipated." Associative systems do not encode feedback systems well. <p> Different aspects of the model may be used in the generation and testing phase. But generation can produce some hypotheses which are not consistent with the model and the symptoms; the model is then run to falsify these hypotheses. * Models in model-based diagnosis are component models, <ref> [de Kleer and Brown, 1984] </ref>. The knowledge about the mechanism is structured in a way patterned after the mechanism's own structure. * In model-based diagnosis, the knowledge engineering task is the descriptions of the behavior of components, rather than the behavior of entire mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: This is the approach taken in this dissertation. We note that there is existing work in model-based diagnosis on methods for determining the `best next observation;' deK-leer and Williams <ref> [de Kleer and Williams, 1987] </ref> describe the use of minimum entropy methods. 2.4 Aspects & Approaches to Model-based Diagnosis We have described the general insights that support model-based diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: If the generated hypothesis gives no guidance in estimating the quantity of toxin ingested, the diagnostic system may fail to confirm the (qualitatively correct) hypothesis. Reasoning with multiple representations will oblige us to translate between them, <ref> [de Kleer, 1977] </ref>. With each shift from one representation to the other, information will either be gained or lost. In our diagnostic work, information is lost when we go from a more exact nonlinear numerical simulation to a linearized model.

Reference-contexts: But its presence can make diagnosis extremely difficult. There is a large body of mathematical analysis of feedback; it is the greater part 33 of the field of process control, (Weber [Weber, 1973] is a good introductory text; see DeKleer for a discussion of the term "feedback," <ref> [de Kleer, 1985] </ref>.) Variable estimation for mechanisms involving feedback is a broad area; for a sense of the scope of some of its application in geology, hydrology, population dynamics, epidemiology and other fields, see [IFA, 1978]. The techniques of these fields are gradually being incorporated into model-based reasoning. <p> Model-based reasoning systems that have dealt with feedback include midas [Kramer, 1990], Ng's work in qualitative diagnosis [Ng, 1990], and deKleer's program for reasoning about circuits, equal, <ref> [de Kleer, 1985] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Raiman [Raiman, 1986] pointed out that, oftentimes, simply knowing the numeric values within an order of magnitude was enough to disambiguate predictions, and presented a methodology for making such inferences. Mavrovouniotis and Stephanopoulos [Mavrovouniotis and Stephanopoulos, 1989] extended these methods, implementing the result in an atms, <ref> [de Kleer, 1986] </ref>. Capturing the comparative behavior of mechanisms with feedback is still somewhat of an open problem in automated diagnosis. Weld [Weld, 1988] has investigated the problem for mechanisms described adequately by qualitative (non-numeric) descriptions.

This work will be discussed further in 2.4.6. 2.2.1.2 Numerical Information in Associative Systems Associative representations do not encode numerical information well; there is no obvious place to locate numerical information within the formalism. <p> Several researchers have built systems that can describe continuously changing variables in qualitative representations. Two of these efforts produced programs that have been widely used by other researchers. [Kuipers, 1984] produced a language for qualitative simulation called qsim. <ref> [Forbus, 1984] </ref> advanced his qualitative process theory, or qpt. The work presented in this report does not use either qsim or qpt.

Reference-contexts: This knowledge, encoded as empirical associations between causes, intermediate states and symptoms, allowed computer programs to deliver expert-level diagnosis of difficult problems. Such programs, (such as mycin, [Shortliffe, 1976] and prospector <ref> [Gaschnig, 1979] </ref>) showed impressive power, but they proved to be difficult to modify and gave poor results on problems containing novel faults or features that had not been specifically encoded into the knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: This drawback became particularly acute when trying to build a diagnostic system for a newly built mechanism; no history exists for such a mechanism, so there are no experts and therefore no experiential knowledge to encode in rules. Working in the domain of electronic circuits, Genesereth <ref> [Genesereth, 1985] </ref> noted that the knowledge encoded in the rules was specific to the mechanism being diagnosed. Rule-based expert systems separated the knowledge from the specific data about a particular case. But the separation was not clean enough to carry over to a similar mechanism. <p> In 1986, Davis gave an overview of this work in an invited talk at aaai, (later revised with Hamscher and issued as [Davis and Hamscher, 1988].) This body of work was referred to in different ways; much of the early work was called "diagnosis from first principals," [Davis, 1985] <ref> [Genesereth, 1985] </ref> [Reiter, 1987]. In time, the modeling issues in such work came to the fore, and the use of models was seen to be important in other automated reasoning tasks beside diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: Systems based on such discretizations have shown improved performance, when compared to traditional rule-based representations [Fagan et al., 1984] [Scarl et al., 1985] [Scarl et al., 1988] [Malin et al., 1990] <ref> [Glass et al., 1990] </ref>. But discrete qualitative algebras have their own problems: * Such algebras are inherently ambiguous. What is the sum of low and very-high? * The algebras quickly get very complex, because different variables will be divided into ranges with different units. <p> This allows the possible predictions of malfunctions, [Malin et al., 1987] [Malin et al., 1990]. Texsys, (developed at nasa Ames), embodies a hybrid approach to qualitative and temporal reasoning to advise the thermal control system aboard the space station, <ref> [Glass et al., 1990] </ref>. It addresses several difficult issues, including a large scaleup to a system with hundreds of complex, nonlinear components, noisy data and real-time performance. 31 2.4.2 Monitoring and Control Several of these implementations of model-based reasoning involve reasoning about temporal behaviors for monitoring and control.

It was formalized by Reiter [Reiter, 1987], who introduced the minimal set cover. Greiner et al, <ref> [Griener et al., 1989] </ref> published a correction of this formalization, and deKleer et al [de Kleer et 27 al., 1990] introduced the kernel diagnosis to correct some of the theoretical difficulties in the way that the minimal set cover had been defined.

Reference-contexts: requiring more sophisticated algebra (e.g., solving two equations in two unknowns.) Such situations are relatively common in domains with nondirectional components and can arise in domains with directional components in structures that have reconvergent fanout (i.e., a signal that branches and then rejoins at the inputs to a component.) Hamscher, <ref> [Hamscher, 1988] </ref> commenting on these methods also warns "[The problems of diagnosing without explicit fault models of components] become evident when diagnosing a system with feedback or high connectivity between its components. <p> However, it may be possible to do some limited testing on the incomplete hypothesis; there is a computational saving for any hypothesis which is rejected before it is completed. Testing is thereby interleaved with generation; Hamscher <ref> [Hamscher, 1988] </ref> provided examples of such interleaving in model-based diagnosis. Results of testing can also inform further hypothesis generation. Simmons and Davis [Simmons and Davis, 1987] described a method in which hypotheses were tested using consistency checking which builds up a dependency tree.

Reference-contexts: This separation provides much of the power and usefulness of such systems. Still, even as these systems were beginning to see widespread use, theoreticians began to notice shortfalls in the ability of the 14 associative representation to represent important knowledge. Hayes <ref> [Hayes, 1979] </ref> argued that such a representation is fundamentally impoverished: it could not gracefully encode much of the knowledge that people use to do trivial reasoning about physical objects. <p> The difficulties cause by discretization of continuous variables have been addressed by the use of quantity spaces, (proposed by Hayes, <ref> [Hayes, 1979] </ref> [Hayes, 1985], and 17 systematized in Forbus [Forbus, 1981] [Forbus, 1984] as qpt, and Kuipers, [Kuipers, 1984] as qsim.)

Reference-contexts: Coverage is a difficult issue for such dictionaries if the number of possible faults is not small; the number of simulation runs is, in the general case, exponential in 24 the number of faults. Himmelblau, <ref> [Himmelblau, 1978, p. 280] </ref>, discusses methods of placing limits on the number of simulations needed for good coverage. Fault dictionaries are not generally tolerant of missing data; fault classification performance degrades badly when no value is available for supposedly observable variables. They also degrade quickly when presented with incorrect data. <p> Reasoning with a linear approximation of a nonlinear mechanism is simpler when identifying and estimating a single variable (point estimation) than several variables (joint estimation). Other methods available for automated diagnosis include several methods of variable estimation. Himmelblau <ref> [Himmelblau, 1978, Chapter 5] </ref> explored variable estimation for several different models, including models in which the constraints are algebraic equations, ordinary and partial differential equations and transfer functions. 2.3.6 Testing Section 2.3.3 noted that a hypothesis about a continuous mechanism could be partially complete, specifying the sign of the fault parameter's <p> If a contradiction was detected, the tree was used to debug, generating an improved hypothesis. Testing can also refine an estimate; outside of ai, `hypothesis testing' has generally referred to statistical methods which involve manipulation of the mechanism to produce additional data, <ref> [Himmelblau, 1978, p. 45] </ref> [Ross, 1990, p. 7]. Although the approach in this dissertation involves testing with additional computation instead of testing by additional data-gathering, the statistical techniques for hypothesis testing are of great potential relevance. Hypothesis testing involves the comparison of predictions and observations.

Reference-contexts: [Weber, 1973] is a good introductory text; see DeKleer for a discussion of the term "feedback," [de Kleer, 1985].) Variable estimation for mechanisms involving feedback is a broad area; for a sense of the scope of some of its application in geology, hydrology, population dynamics, epidemiology and other fields, see <ref> [IFA, 1978] </ref>. The techniques of these fields are gradually being incorporated into model-based reasoning. But the practice of model-based reasoning has not made a wholesale incorporation of these techniques. This has not happened both for technological and methodological reasons.

Interesting systems built in this manner include the work of Dvorak [Dvorak, 1987], and Dvorak and Kuipers [Dvorak and Kuipers, 1989], which built a qualitative simulation to reason about alarms, using the qsim program to model the process. Similarly, Kay <ref> [Kay, 1991] </ref> described a method for dynamically recomputing the qualitative bounds around a qualitative behavior, given bounds on the qualitative constraints and on the initial conditions; they consider applications which include alarm limits which vary as process conditions change.

Reference-contexts: Further, it only poorly captures the relationships among the components that make up the mechanism, and it is through these components that causal events flow, connecting faults to the observable behavior. DeKleer and Brown [de Kleer and Brown, 1984] and Klein and Finin <ref> [Klein and Finin, 1987] </ref> note that this descriptive failure leads to diagnostic systems that are "unable to deal with circumstances even slightly different than those explicitly anticipated."

Reference-contexts: The model-based approach to feedback has involved reasoning about it explicitly, rather than encoding any of the feedback technologies into a black-box and using it as an oracle. Model-based reasoning systems that have dealt with feedback include midas <ref> [Kramer, 1990] </ref>, Ng's work in qualitative diagnosis [Ng, 1990], and deKleer's program for reasoning about circuits, equal, [de Kleer, 1985]. <p> Kramer and his students Finch and Oyeleye at mit are developing a causal modeling program, midas, <ref> [Kramer, 1990] </ref> [Oyeleye, 1990] [Finch, 1989].

Reference-contexts: There are other representations which allow numerical information to be represented explicitly, and yet also provide support for model-based reasoning; the qsim program, with its recent extensions to mixed quantitative/qualitative representations q2 and q3 <ref> [Kuipers and Berleant, 1988] </ref>, is prominent among these. Although we are very familiar with the qsim representation, we did not incorporate it into heatx for several reasons: * At the time we began encoding heatx, the inclusion of a quantitative representation in qsim was just beginning.

Reference-contexts: It uses these higher order derivatives to eliminate certain spurious predictions of behavior. Waltz filtering and pairwise constraint satisfaction are not powerful enough to use this information; qsim represents these higher order derivatives as algebraic expressions and uses a small automatic algebra system to solve them, [Dalle Molle, 1989a] <ref> [Kuipers and Chiu, 1987] </ref> [Chiu, 1988] [Kuipers et al., 1991].

Reference-contexts: A model-based approach can diagnose these faults because it builds up the novel behavior mechanisms from the known behaviors of components.

Reference-contexts: Waltz filtering and pairwise constraint satisfaction are not powerful enough to use this information; qsim represents these higher order derivatives as algebraic expressions and uses a small automatic algebra system to solve them, [Dalle Molle, 1989a] [Kuipers and Chiu, 1987] [Chiu, 1988] <ref> [Kuipers et al., 1991] </ref>. <p> In particular, as the behavior at extreme deviations seems to be causing the most difficulty, a representation which captured the shape of the curve of the component behaviors seems promising. Using such higher-order derivative knowledge is discussed in Kuipers et al <ref> [Kuipers et al., 1991] </ref>; an approach by Stephanopoulos [Stephanopoulos, 1990] of describing such functions in terms of bracketing triangles maintains numeric information while providing a description that is composable and invertible. 114 If the qualitative abstraction were performed earlier, the sign of the result of the qualitative abstraction would be ambiguous

Reference-contexts: In the general case, consistency checking is NP-complete. However, in some specialized domains consistency checking can be performed in reasonable amounts of time. Ng [Ng, 1990] extended diagnose to consider qualitative models of continuous systems, and used qsim <ref> [Kuipers, 1986] </ref> as a consistency checker. The discussion of constraint suspension, above, noted problems which that technique had when considering systems with feedback, non-directional components and reconvergent fanout: when any single suspected component is causally upstream from all components, then any fault hypothesis seems to explain all symptoms.

Reference-contexts: Systems based on such discretizations have shown improved performance, when compared to traditional rule-based representations [Fagan et al., 1984] [Scarl et al., 1985] [Scarl et al., 1988] <ref> [Malin et al., 1990] </ref> [Glass et al., 1990]. But discrete qualitative algebras have their own problems: * Such algebras are inherently ambiguous. What is the sum of low and very-high? * The algebras quickly get very complex, because different variables will be divided into ranges with different units. <p> By discretizing the numeric values into qualitative descriptors, it transforms the description of the behavior of such systems from continuous behaviors into behaviors that can be studied using discrete event simulation. This allows the possible predictions of malfunctions, [Malin et al., 1987] <ref> [Malin et al., 1990] </ref>. Texsys, (developed at nasa Ames), embodies a hybrid approach to qualitative and temporal reasoning to advise the thermal control system aboard the space station, [Glass et al., 1990].

Reference-contexts: Raiman [Raiman, 1986] pointed out that, oftentimes, simply knowing the numeric values within an order of magnitude was enough to disambiguate predictions, and presented a methodology for making such inferences. Mavrovouniotis and Stephanopoulos <ref> [Mavrovouniotis and Stephanopoulos, 1989] </ref> extended these methods, implementing the result in an atms, [de Kleer, 1986]. Capturing the comparative behavior of mechanisms with feedback is still somewhat of an open problem in automated diagnosis. Weld [Weld, 1988] has investigated the problem for mechanisms described adequately by qualitative (non-numeric) descriptions.

Reference-contexts: It is especially difficult to capture the behavior of mechanisms with variables that change continuously over time in associative representations. <ref> [McDermott, 1982] </ref> proposed a temporal logic to better capture events and processes. Several researchers have built systems that can describe continuously changing variables in qualitative representations.

Reference-contexts: This is not to say that numerical computation cannot be done by associative systems. Such systems have always provided `backdoors,' ways of escaping from the rule language into the underlying language (usually lisp) to do calculations, <ref> [Melle, ] </ref>. But calculations by the system are not the same as calculations in the system.

It generates hypothesis by some suitable means, and uses 21 a model (or models) to test them, [Davis and Hamscher, 1988]. Both the generation and the testing phases may be subdivided, and the phases can be interleaved.

This separation provides much of the power and usefulness of such systems. Still, even as these systems were beginning to see widespread use, theoreticians began to notice shortfalls in the ability of the 14 associative representation to represent important knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Ng makes a finer point, that each fault in the mechanism corresponds to, and is localizable to, some fault in an individual component, <ref> [Ng, 1990] </ref>. 20 2.3.2 The Promise of Model-Based Diagnosis What does adopting a model-based approach gain us? Section 2.2 gave an accounting of the shortfalls that caused researchers to move away from the purely associative approach to diagnosis. <p> To execute, diagnose must repeatedly check the consistency of a set of components. In the general case, consistency checking is NP-complete. However, in some specialized domains consistency checking can be performed in reasonable amounts of time. Ng <ref> [Ng, 1990] </ref> extended diagnose to consider qualitative models of continuous systems, and used qsim [Kuipers, 1986] as a consistency checker. <p> The model-based approach to feedback has involved reasoning about it explicitly, rather than encoding any of the feedback technologies into a black-box and using it as an oracle. Model-based reasoning systems that have dealt with feedback include midas [Kramer, 1990], Ng's work in qualitative diagnosis <ref> [Ng, 1990] </ref>, and deKleer's program for reasoning about circuits, equal, [de Kleer, 1985]. <p> Qsim models are constraint-based. Typically, a single constraint will correspond to a single component. Bareiss and Farquhar [Bareiss and Farquhar, 1986] built fault models of components by substituting constraints describing faulty components for the constraints describing the normal behavior. Ng <ref> [Ng, 1990] </ref> did diagnosis without fault models, by withdrawing the constraint corresponding to the fault candidate and seeing if any behavior corresponding to the observations could be produced.

Reference-contexts: of the system, we can run it through a large number of scenarios, and catalog the results. (We do not necessarily need a computer model; physical models are often used, too.) Then, when our mechanism fails, we can match the behavior it displays against one we generated on our model, <ref> [Park, 1979] </ref>. The task is to exploit our knowledge of the model so that we do not have to run the power set of all of our fault variables in order to get a useful classification, and to sort our results so they fit into some reasonably compact accounting.

Reference-contexts: 1986, Davis gave an overview of this work in an invited talk at aaai, (later revised with Hamscher and issued as [Davis and Hamscher, 1988].) This body of work was referred to in different ways; much of the early work was called "diagnosis from first principals," [Davis, 1985] [Genesereth, 1985] <ref> [Reiter, 1987] </ref>. In time, the modeling issues in such work came to the fore, and the use of models was seen to be important in other automated reasoning tasks beside diagnosis. <p> In this usage, a set cover is a set of faults which could, jointly, explain the symptoms in a behavior. Set covering was proposed by Reggia et al [no cite yet]. It was formalized by Reiter <ref> [Reiter, 1987] </ref>, who introduced the minimal set cover.

For an introduction to the issue in this area, see [Sorenson, 1980]; for an extension to nonlinear problems see <ref> [Ross, 1990] </ref>. The study of data reconciliation and rectification has addressed the issue of diagnosis in a problem-space in which there are a large number of possible faults. <p> If a contradiction was detected, the tree was used to debug, generating an improved hypothesis. Testing can also refine an estimate; outside of ai, `hypothesis testing' has generally referred to statistical methods which involve manipulation of the mechanism to produce additional data, [Himmelblau, 1978, p. 45] <ref> [Ross, 1990, p. 7] </ref>. Although the approach in this dissertation involves testing with additional computation instead of testing by additional data-gathering, the statistical techniques for hypothesis testing are of great potential relevance. Hypothesis testing involves the comparison of predictions and observations.

Reference-contexts: As problem spaces and problem specifications grew larger, expert systems began using domain knowledge to manage heuristic search in diagnosis. This knowledge, encoded as empirical associations between causes, intermediate states and symptoms, allowed computer programs to deliver expert-level diagnosis of difficult problems. Such programs, (such as mycin, <ref> [Shortliffe, 1976] </ref> and prospector [Gaschnig, 1979]) showed impressive power, but they proved to be difficult to modify and gave poor results on problems containing novel faults or features that had not been specifically encoded into the knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: This approach does not use fault models; no new constraints are added that describe how the component behaves when broken. The dependency backtracking suggests which components are causally connected to the faults. The constraint suspension provides a quick filter that makes the generation more informed. Simmons and Davis <ref> [Simmons and Davis, 1987] </ref> describe a system in which the dependency records, in addition to directing the hypothesis generation, guide the debugging of hypotheses that are rejected when tested. <p> Testing is thereby interleaved with generation; Hamscher [Hamscher, 1988] provided examples of such interleaving in model-based diagnosis. Results of testing can also inform further hypothesis generation. Simmons and Davis <ref> [Simmons and Davis, 1987] </ref> described a method in which hypotheses were tested using consistency checking which builds up a dependency tree. If a contradiction was detected, the tree was used to debug, generating an improved hypothesis.

Reference-contexts: Such principals constrain the possible faulty behaviors and it is prudent to use such knowledge when it is available. If a system does not constrain the possible behaviors of faulty components, it may generate bizarre explanations of behaviors.

Reference-contexts: Neural nets have also been used to identify faults in chemical processing equipment. Hoskins and Himmelblau, [Hoskins and Himmelblau, 1988] trained a neural net to recognize six different classes of fault in a series of continuous stirred-tank reactors. Venkatasubramanian et al <ref> [Venkatasubramanian et al., 1990] </ref> trained a neural net on single-fault failures and showed that it was often capable of diagnosing multiple-fault failures when the multiple faults were composed of single faults from the training set.

Reference-contexts: In [Grantham and Ungar, 1991], they discussed work in comparative analysis, using the same system. They make an interesting point in <ref> [Vinson et al., 1991] </ref>: In process engineering, however, device models are not as straight-forward as in electrical engineering. Chemical devices (units) tend to be much more complex than electrical devices, partly because they handle multi-component inputs rather than just electrons.

Reference-contexts: But the rule-based representation alone did not naturally support this. Rulebases were seen as difficult to construct, <ref> [Waterman, 1986] </ref>. No clear methodology emerged that allowed a knowledge engineer to go directly and systematically from the known structure of a mechanism to an encoding in a rulebase.

Reference-contexts: Feedback is ubiquitous in natural systems. But its presence can make diagnosis extremely difficult. There is a large body of mathematical analysis of feedback; it is the greater part 33 of the field of process control, (Weber <ref> [Weber, 1973] </ref> is a good introductory text; see DeKleer for a discussion of the term "feedback," [de Kleer, 1985].) Variable estimation for mechanisms involving feedback is a broad area; for a sense of the scope of some of its application in geology, hydrology, population dynamics, epidemiology and other fields, see [IFA,

Reference-contexts: Mavrovouniotis and Stephanopoulos [Mavrovouniotis and Stephanopoulos, 1989] extended these methods, implementing the result in an atms, [de Kleer, 1986]. Capturing the comparative behavior of mechanisms with feedback is still somewhat of an open problem in automated diagnosis. Weld <ref> [Weld, 1988] </ref> has investigated the problem for mechanisms described adequately by qualitative (non-numeric) descriptions. But work remains to be done. 2.4.4 Reasoning About Feedback Section 2.2.1 discussed difficulties in representing a feedback system in a traditional rule-based system.
