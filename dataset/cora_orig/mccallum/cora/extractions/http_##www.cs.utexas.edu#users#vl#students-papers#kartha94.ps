Abstract: Andrew Baker's approach to reasoning about actions is the most robust circumscriptive approach currently known. Investigation of its applicability to nondeterministic actions reveals that this approach does not allow us to draw some intuitively plausible conclusions. Also, it does not always generate the proper existence of situations axiom. The limitations are traced to an unexpected interference of the axioms encoding observations with the minimization. A modification that avoids the shortcomings is suggested.

Reference-contexts: The major change suggested by Baker is to employ a new circumscription policy: to minimize Ab while varying Result and S 0 (as opposed to varying Holds, as is done in <ref> [ Hanks and McDermott, 1987 ] </ref> ). For this to work correctly, Baker includes an existence of situations axiom, which says that corresponding to each set of fluents, there is a situation in which exactly these fluents hold.

Reference-contexts: Also, both counterexamples involve reasoning backward in time. In fact, it can be shown that for the class of deterministic or temporal projection domains expressible in the language AR 0 defined in <ref> [ Kartha and Lifschitz, 1994 ] </ref> , Baker's method works correctly. 10 The counterexamples thus show that as soon as we stray outside the realm of deterministic or temporal projection domains, Baker's method may not allow us to justify some intuitively plausible results. <p> The framework of nested abnormality theories [ Lifschitz, 1994 ] , by limiting the applicability of various circumscriptions to subsets of the theory under consideration, allows this kind of flexibility. In <ref> [ Kartha and Lifschitz, 1994 ] </ref> , the modification suggested in the previous paragraph (i.e. excluding the observations from the minimization) is expressed as a nested abnormality theory and a theorem is proved showing that the modification works correctly for a large class of domains that, in particular, includes the two-bus

Reference-contexts: Following <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993a ] </ref> , let us denote the circumscription of the predicate P in the formula A, with the predicates and functions in the tuple Z varied by CIRC (A; P ; Z). <p> We will now show that M is a model of CIRC (D 1 ; Ab; Result; S 0 ). Assume that M is not a minimal model with respect to Ab;Result;S 0 (See <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993a ] </ref> for a definition of this order relation). Then there is a model M 0 identical to M except (possibly) in the interpretations of Result and S 0 and where the extent of Ab is strictly smaller than its extent in M .

Reference-contexts: That is, observation axioms should serve only to rule out some models, never to include new ones. This property seems quite desirable in view of the similar use made of observations by humans in many everyday situations. Both examples do not have this restricted monotonicity <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993b ] </ref> property. This suggests that a way out is to apply circumscription not to the whole theory of action, but to the theory of action minus the observation axioms, and then to include the observation axioms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It has long been recognized <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] </ref> that the frame problem, viz. the problem of formalizing in a natural and succinct fashion what is unchanged as a result of performing an action, is central to reasoning about change. <p> We also assume that initially, he does not have a ticket and that he is not on the bus. To formalize this example in the situation calculus <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] </ref> , we use a three sorted language with sorts for situations, fluents and actions. A situation can be thought of as the snapshot of the world at a particular instant, and a fluent as a property that may hold in a situation.

Baker [1991] proposed a simple circumscriptive approach that solved the YSP correctly.

Reference-contexts: Such a method of excluding the observations from the minimization was proposed by Sandewall [1989] in the context of chronological minimization <ref> [ Shoham, 1988 ] </ref> and by Crawford and Etherington [1992] in the context of avoiding interference between minimizations solving the frame and the qualification problems. Let us now see how we can apply this idea to the examples.
