Title: A formal and computational characterization of pragmatic infelicities  
Author: Daniel Marcu and Graeme Hirst 
Abstract: We study the logical properties that characterize pragmatic inferences and we show that classical understanding of notions such as entailment and defeasibility is not enough if one wants to explain infelicities that occur when a pragmatic inference is cancelled. We show that infelicities can be detected if a special kind of inference is considered, namely infelicitously defeasible inference. We also show how one can use stratified logic, a linguistically motivated formalism that accommodates indefeasible, infelicitously defeasible, and felicitously defeasible inferences, to reason about pragmatic inferences and detect infelicities associated with utterances. The formalism yields an algorithm for detecting infelicities, which has been implemented in Lisp.

Reference-contexts: In contrast with semantic inferences, which are triggered by commonsense knowledge, pragmatic inferences are derived from general rules that govern the use of language. They can be lexical in nature, as in the case of a factive [11], syntactic, as in the case of a cleft sentence <ref> [1] </ref>, semantic, as in the case of some conventional implicatures [7, 4], or purely pragmatic, as in the case of the conversational implicatures [6]. None of these inferences are derivable from purely semantic information.

Reference-contexts: A linguist will say that utterances (1)-(4) are infelicitous and will notice that in all of them a pragmatic inference is infelicitously defeated: utterance (1) tries to cancel a conversational implicature that is triggered by the maxim of quality [6]; utterance (2) tries to cancel a conventional scalar implicature <ref> [7, 4] </ref>; utterance (3) tries to cancel a conversational implicature that is triggered by the maxim of manner [6]; and (4) tries to cancel a presupposition carried by an implicative verb [8]. <p> The same agreement has been reached for presuppositions triggered in negative environments: all of them are considered defeasible. In contrast, there is no agreement with respect to presuppositions triggered in positive environments: some researchers [9] consider them to be defeasible, others [13] treat them as entailments, and still others <ref> [4] </ref> consider that presuppositions carried by factives, clefts, and definite descriptions are entailments, but they do not commit themselves to a definitive position for other types of presuppositions. Most pragmatic inferences are generally felicitously defea-sible, i.e., it is not anomalous to defeat them. <p> They can be lexical in nature, as in the case of a factive [11], syntactic, as in the case of a cleft sentence [1], semantic, as in the case of some conventional implicatures <ref> [7, 4] </ref>, or purely pragmatic, as in the case of the conversational implicatures [6]. None of these inferences are derivable from purely semantic information. Rather, an utterance is necessary in order to bring them to life, and that is the reason we call them pragmatic.

Reference-contexts: We show how stratified logic [14], a linguistically motivated formalism that distinguishes between different levels of defeasibility and different "levels" of satisfiability, can be used for expressing notions such as pragmatic inference and infelicity. We also propose an extension of the implementation described by Marcu and Hirst <ref> [15] </ref>, which takes as input an utterance or a set of utterances expressed in terms of stratified formulae, evaluates them against a knowledge base that contains both semantic and pragmatic knowledge, and detects which utterances are felicitous and which are not. 2 A logical analysis of semantic and pragmatic inferences We <p> In this paper, we argue that a possible way to account for both these facets of cancelability is to use the multiple definition of satisfaction that was provided by Marcu and Hirst <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> We say that utterance u is infelicitous if and only if there is no stratified structure SL that i-satisfies [ uttered (u). Since our approach is intended to provide both the ability to detect infelicities and compute pragmatic inferences, we modify definition 2.2 of Marcu and Hirst <ref> [15] </ref> so that pragmatic inferences are determined only with respect to the models that are optimistic and felicitous. <p> Hirst Schema # Indefeasible Infelicitously Felicitously defeasible defeasible m 0 forgot u (john; l d) :intended u (john; l d) intended i (john; l d) intended d (john; l d) computes the set of preferred schemata and the pragmatic inferences according to definition 4.2 (for details, see <ref> [15] </ref>). The new algorithm has been fully implemented in Common Lisp. <p> The finer-grained definition of satisfiability enables one to detect the infelicities that occur when some infelicitously de-feasible inferences are cancelled and to compute the expected pragmatic inferences that pertain to an utterance or a sequence of utterances. We extend on previous work reported by Marcu and Hirst <ref> [15] </ref> and implement an algorithm that detects the infelicities that are associated with an utterance or a sequence of utterances.

Reference-contexts: Although such a definition could account for the inferences that are most likely to be drawn from utterances of the kind shown in examples (5)-(7) (see Mercer <ref> [16] </ref> for an approach designed along these lines that handles presuppositions), it could not explain why defeating some pragmatic inferences is felicitous, while defeating others is not.
