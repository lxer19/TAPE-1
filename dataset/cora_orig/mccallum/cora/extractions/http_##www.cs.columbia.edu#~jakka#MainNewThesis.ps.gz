Reference-contexts: One of them is the exchange based economy and the other is the price based economy <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. In the exchange based economy, each agent is initially endowed with some amounts of the resources. They exchange resources till the marginal rate of substitution of the resources is the same for all the agents. <p> The allocation at this point is Pareto optimal. A fundamental problem in distributed control mechanisms which attempt to 19 allocate resources in an efficient manner defined by Pareto efficiency <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref> or Nash equilibrium is that the distributed algorithms must converge to the equilibrium point. <p> The cost C k is composed of the cost of accessing service at processor P k and cost of to and fro communication bandwidth from the job origin to P k (here k 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref>). 8 k * Service time preference (ST): Jobs prefer the element of the budget set which gives the least response time (or service time). <p> Processors also leased resources to other processors to make profit using the revenue they earned. The distributed system consisted of N processing nodes connected via links. Each processor P i ( i 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref>) has rate r i at which it can process operations on local data. A link e ij connects processor P i to P j . There are M data objects denoted by D 1 ; D 2 ; :::; D M . <p> Let B denote the output buffer of a 37 link and C be the corresponding link capacity. Let fc k ; b k g be the link capacity and buffer 11 allocation to class k on a link, where k 2 <ref> [1; K] </ref>. Let ~p = fp c ; p b g be the price per unit link capacity and unit buffer at a link, and w k be the wealth (budget) of traffic class k. <p> A thorough treatment of a social welfare function (a function of individual agent utility functions) that maps to a Pareto allocation is given in <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. Each agent computes the demand set, which is a set of allocations, that maximizes the preference under the wealth constraint. The demand set is obtained by minimizing the utility function under the budget constraint. <p> The Lagrangian is given below with L as the Lagrange multiplier. 42 c 0; b 0 The function f (c; b; ) is smooth, strictly convex and compact, thus the demand set is just one element <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Using the Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions [3], the optimal resource allocation vector is obtained, where L is the Lagrange multiplier [2, 3]. @c @U = L fl p b (2:7) From this the equilibrium condition is obtained. <p> as follows for K competing classes: 2.3.1.3 Competitive Pricing Algorithm: 1 Set initial prices: p c = p 0 c , p b = p 0 2 Compute demand set, ie. find minimum of min [U i = f i (c i ; b i ; i )] 8i 2 <ref> [1; K] </ref>; given p c c i + p b b i w i (wealth constraint). 3 Demand: D c = P i=K P i=K 4 If (D c C) &lt; (&gt;) 0, then, p c = p c (+) c If (D b B) &lt; (&gt;) 0, then, p b <p> We assume that the traffic classes have convex preferences on the resources. Let P S be the Pareto surface. The QoS surface is defined as: QS = fx : x 2 P S; U i (x) U c i ; 8i 2 <ref> [1; K] </ref>g, where U c i is a constraint on the utility function for class i. <p> Therefore, the preferences for average delay are non-convex. Due to this, if an agent uses this utility function then there does not exist price equilibrium or Pareto optimality <ref> [1, 2] </ref> for the two resources, but for one resource (link bandwidth), the competition exists. However, we transform the average delay function into a normalized average delay function. The main motivation being the following: average delay in a finite buffer is always less than the buffer size. <p> tail probability is given as follows: U = c 1 + S r p (1 ) 2 (C 2 ! b Proposition 1 The utility function is decreasing convex in c; 8 c 2 [S r p ; S r p ] and decreasing convex in b 8 b 2 <ref> [1; B] </ref>, where B is the available buffer. proof: is omitted. In the numerical examples, we use two traffic classes (with the same values). There are S 1 = S 2 = 10 sessions in each traffic class, and T = 5; r p = 1; = 0:5. <p> The utility function for agent 1 is as follows: U 1 = fl 1 U l + (1 fl 1 )U d (2:27) where, fl 1 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 64 The utility function for agent 2 is as follows: U 2 = fl 2 U l + (1 fl 2 )U d (2:28) where, fl 2 2 [0; 1]. <p> as follows: U 1 = fl 1 U l + (1 fl 1 )U d (2:27) where, fl 1 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 64 The utility function for agent 2 is as follows: U 2 = fl 2 U l + (1 fl 2 )U d (2:28) where, fl 2 2 [0; 1]. For example, agent 1 might prefer more weight on loss probability than normalized average delay compared to agent 2, which weighs normalized average delay more than loss probability. Let agent 1 choose fl 1 = 0:9, and agent 2 choose fl 2 = 0:1. <p> In the economy, resources are not only utilized efficiently, but also allocated in such a way that users 15 with diverse requirements achieve maximal benefit (individual optimality) <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. Kadabha and Jaffe [17] proposed optimal flow control mechanisms in networks based on utility functions which represented throughput-delay trade-offs of sessions. Kurose et. al. [9, 10] used an exchange economy 16 model to design multiple access protocols, and verified that competitive equilibrium exists. <p> The prices can be normalized such that (p c + p b ) = 1. By normalizing the prices, the budget set B (~p) does not change, therefore the demand function of the traffic classes (utility under the demand set (~p)) is homogenous of degree zero in the prices <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. <p> The equilibrium point is defined as the point where the excess demand function is zero. Then using fixed-point theorems <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref> (Brower fixed point theorem), the existence of the equilibrium price for a given demand can be shown very easily. Different sets of wealth inputs of the traffic classes will have different Pareto allocations and price equilibria. <p> Let B denote the output buffer of a link and C be the corresponding link capacity. Let fc k ; b k g be the link capacity and buffer 6 allocation to class k on a link, where k 2 <ref> [1; K] </ref>. Let ~p = fp c ; p b g be the price per unit link capacity and unit buffer at a link, and w k be the wealth (budget) of traffic class k. <p> The scheduler then picks a queue at random, uniformly distributed. The packet sizes are 53 bytes. is scheduled from the queue that has: min [b k q k ] 8k 2 <ref> [1; K] </ref> (3:3) where each agent k has been allocated buffer size b k (or max queue size), and q k is the current state of the queue. <p> The variable n i ; 8i 2 <ref> [1; K] </ref> is the number of sessions that can be admitted within a traffic class, assuming each session generates poisson traffic with the same average rate, which adds up to i . Therefore, n i and i can be interchanged. <p> For each period, the prices and allocations of resources is shown. The traffic model for each agent is assumed to be M=M=1=B. The QoS parameter for each agent is packet loss probability. In the table T C i corresponds to agent i, for i 2 <ref> [1; 2] </ref>. of the contour of the utility function with respect to the allocation variables (see chapter 2). Agent 1 and Agent 2 invest same wealth: In Table 3.3, the demand or load is fixed. Agent 1 in subsequent time periods has higher and higher 1 . <p> Agent 3 decreases its load and wealth starting from the first time-period. The load () and wealth (w) remains the same for agent 4 for all time-periods. In the first time period, k and w k are the same for all k 2 <ref> [1; 4] </ref>. The Pareto optimal allocation is the equal division of resources. As 1 and w 1 of T C 1 , and 2 and w 2 of T C 2 increase, the optimal allocations to these traffic classes increases for the new time-period. <p> Let fc k ; b k g be the link capacity and buffer 6 allocation to class k on link j, where k 2 <ref> [1; K] </ref>. Let p j j b be the price per unit link capacity and unit buffer respectively at link j, and w k be the wealth (budget) of a traffic class k. <p> Given that P K P K B for all i; k 2 <ref> [1; K] </ref>, then the Pareto Surface exists. Given the wealth constraint w k of the traffic classes, (1) Pareto optimal allocation exists and (2) Price equilibrium exists. <p> Formally, the agent has to find the following: find: f i1 ; i2 ; ::::; iN g (4.6) minimize: 1 Q N i=1 (1 P block ) (4.7) given that: fc fl ij ; b fl constraints: P N where ij = fl ij = i for all j 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> is the session level utilization, and P N and i = fl i = i . For The main goal of agent i is to minimize session level blocking probability or maximize the thruput of the sessions through the network system. <p> The sessions of traffic class k arrived to the network at a Poisson rate of fl k . The session holding time was exponentially distributed with mean -k (here k 2 <ref> [1; 2] </ref>). Each session of class k that arrived had average packet arrival rate k (traffic parameters are Poisson arrivals) and the mean service time was exponentially distributed with mean one. <p> We use the standard techniques of optimization to find the demand set, which is given as follows for all j 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref>. c ij = ij + P N P N q u t ij (4:17) Price equilibrium: Once the demand set is obtained, then using the wealth constraints, we can solve for the equilibrium price, however, this is not easily tractable. <p> utility function (packet loss probability) as shown by equa tion 4.32 for a traffic class k is decreasing convex in c j j decreasing convex in b j j The proof is as follows: The utility function is differentiated twice to show that the function is decreasing convex and smooth <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. We know from theorem 6.5 that P j k is decreasing convex and smooth in c j k (where c j j k (where b k 2 [0; B j ]).

Reference-contexts: Let U (:) be a utility function which maps the resource space to a real number and let x and y be two resource allocation vectors. An agent prefers x y, when U (x) &gt; U (y). Debreu <ref> [2] </ref> has shown that if the preference ordering is complete, reflexive, transitive, and continuous, then a continuous utility function can represent this preference.

Reference-contexts: Consumers buy resources or services such that the benefit they receive 6 is maximized. Consumer-agents 4 buy resources based on maximizing performance criteria. As a whole, the system performance is determined by some combination of the individual performance criteria.

[51], Mark et. al [53], Stonebraker et. al [58], Carl et. al. [60], Ron et. al [16], Jordan [35], Honig [66], Sairamesh et. al. [11, 8, 40, 41], Hongbin [65], Lazar [72, 73], and MacKie-Mason [63, 64, 37]. <p> Recently, Stonebraker et. al. [58] have looked at the problem of efficient query processing and data migration in large database systems which involve thousands of data sites (nodes). They chose an economic paradigm similar to the one described in <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref> to design a distributed database system: Mariposa, which can handle several thousand data sites. They designed efficient bidding mechanisms for clients to access data sites. This is the first known working system which is based on economic paradigms. <p> In this section, we present the economic approaches to resource allocation in computer systems using case studies of load balancing and data management in distributed systems and flow control from <ref> [4, 5, 6, 50] </ref>. 1.5.2.1 Load Balancing Economy The load balancing economy was considered in [4, 50]. In this economy, there are N processors (P 1 ; P 2 ; P 3 ; P 4 ; ::::; P N ) connected via a point-to-point network. <p> In this section, we present the economic approaches to resource allocation in computer systems using case studies of load balancing and data management in distributed systems and flow control from [4, 5, 6, 50]. 1.5.2.1 Load Balancing Economy The load balancing economy was considered in <ref> [4, 50] </ref>. In this economy, there are N processors (P 1 ; P 2 ; P 3 ; P 4 ; ::::; P N ) connected via a point-to-point network. A link e ij is a connection between P i and P j . <p> case study shows that for the load balancing problem, competitive economic concepts can achieve better levels of performance when compared to non-economic algorithms. 1.5.2.2 Flow Control Economy The problem of allocating network bandwidth among several virtual circuits (VCs) in a packet based computer network was considered by Ferguson et. al. <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. They used preference relations to model the heterogeneous requirements of the VCs. The relations modeled the trade-offs in average packet delay and over all throughput of each VC. They presented decentralized flow control algorithms to allocate link capacity to VCs with heterogeneous service requirements. <p> The problem of data migration and replication was formulated in an economic setting by Ferguson <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Transactions that entered the system for service were charged by the processors for read and write access to data objects. Processors also leased resources to other processors to make profit using the revenue they earned. The distributed system consisted of N processing nodes connected via links. <p> In the papers by Don Ferguson <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, the prices are set by the link controllers at each node using a Tatonnement 13 process.

An architecture to integrate, manage and control resources/services on an end-to-end basis for effective QoS provisioning is needed. 67 A few researchers have used economic models for QoS provisioning in networks <ref> [18, 17, 4, 5, 9, 10, 15, 16] </ref>.

[9, 10] used an exchange economy 16 model to design multiple access protocols, and verified that competitive equilibrium exists. This work was extended by Don Ferguson et. al. <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref> to study flow control in packet networks and resource allocation in distributed systems. Ron et.al. [16] have developed pricing schemes for networks (Internet) to support multiple services. In their model, prices are set based on service classes. <p> Agent 3 decreases its load and wealth starting from the first time-period. The load () and wealth (w) remains the same for agent 4 for all time-periods. In the first time period, k and w k are the same for all k 2 <ref> [1; 4] </ref>. The Pareto optimal allocation is the equal division of resources. As 1 and w 1 of T C 1 , and 2 and w 2 of T C 2 increase, the optimal allocations to these traffic classes increases for the new time-period.

Reference-contexts: We show how the traffic variability has an impact on the resource allocations, and in general the Pareto surface at a link. We assume an ATM type network model, where packets are fixed size (53 bytes). ON-OFF models are commonly used as traffic models in ATM networks <ref> [20] </ref>. These traffic sources transmit ATM 14 cells at a constant rate when active and nothing when inactive. The traffic parameters are average burst length, average rate, peak rate, and variances in burst length. The traffic models, for such sources are ON-OFF Markov sources [20]. <p> as traffic models in ATM networks <ref> [20] </ref>. These traffic sources transmit ATM 14 cells at a constant rate when active and nothing when inactive. The traffic parameters are average burst length, average rate, peak rate, and variances in burst length. The traffic models, for such sources are ON-OFF Markov sources [20]. A source in a time-slot (assuming a discrete-time model) is either "OFF" or "ON". In the ON state it transmits one cell and in the OFF state does not transmit any cell. <p> In the ON state it transmits one cell and in the OFF state does not transmit any cell. When several such (homogeneous or heterogeneous) sources feed into an infinite buffer queue, the tail distribution of the queue is given by the following formula <ref> [20] </ref>. 14 fixed size packet are carried by ATM networks, the packet sizes are 53 bytes 60 v )(a (c; b; ; C 2 where h (c; b; C 2 v ) and a (c; b; C 2 v ) are functions of traffic parameters and link capacity c. <p> The packet tail distribution of the queue when sources are multiplexed into an infinite buffer queue is given in <ref> [20] </ref>. <p> However, we use simulations with traffic generated from well-known arrival distributions such as poisson and ON-OFF sources <ref> [20] </ref>. For numerical results, we consider the following traffic models in order to evaluate the scheduling algorithm and to ensure that the bandwidth is being delivered. Agent Model 1: We consider two agents, representing traffic classes of M=M=1=B model. The utility function for loss is shown in chapter 2.
