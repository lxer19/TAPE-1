Abstract: This analysis of XPatch synthesized SAR images shows promising results on existence of persistent scatterers and their measurement in XPatch imagery. Preliminary results based on persistent scat-terers and a generic vehicle model demonstrate estimation of vehicle orientation to about 3 degrees, length between wheels to about 30 cm, and estimating number of wheels, without knowledge of vehicle class or pose. Planned research will investigate recognition using generic target and clutter models in analysis of a stable, useful subset of radar images. Research will include quantitative characterization of persistent scatterers and stable relations, an end-to-end recognition test, and investigation of supporting technology for MSTAR. The paradigm offers a genuine methodology to cope with articulation and obscuration.

In fact, measurement of dimensions seems to be relatively accurate. The distance between wheels has a standard deviation of 10 inches. These dimensions go a long way toward constraining vehicle class. 4 Conclusions These preliminary results appear to warrant further investigation.

Reference-contexts: We were motivated by analysis of scattering of target components to ask whether stable scatterers exist. A component scattering model was not regarded as plausible in 1991. In turntable experiments, <ref> [Dudgeon 94] </ref> found evidence for persistent scatterers, a minimum of about 10 at any angle, persistent for a minimum of 20 degrees, with no disappearance of more than one degree. Subsequently, we found persistent scatterers in XPatch data. <p> These estimates cover a range from 10 to 170 degrees; above we saw that the range could be extended a little further, but it cannot be extended below about 5 degrees. <ref> [Dudgeon 94] </ref> observed that zero degrees and ninety degrees were special views. Those views showed up in our experiments and for physical reasons, in our generic vehicle model. Over this wide range of angles, the standard deviations for vehicle azimuth angles were 4.0, 2.3, and 3.7 degrees. <p> Again, the peaks persist over nearly the whole angle range. Similar results were obtained for the BMP. They are omitted to cut space and to avoid detail. 3 Observations Persistent scatterers have been demonstrated in real SAR from turntable data <ref> [Dudgeon 94] </ref>, in XPatch synthesized SAR, and predicted in analysis. At this early stage, the apparent ratio of persistent to non-persistent scatterers is more favorable than expected. There appear to be about a dozen persistent scatterers on vehicles like the three shown here.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, context is widely regarded as an effective way to eliminate large classes of clutter from fixed targets and civilian vehicles <ref> [Levitt 95] </ref>. This research will investigate context-enhanced discrimination of targets vs natural and cultural clutter based on correspondence between context from available databases (e.g. DMIF or HUB) and extended structures registered from imagery [Oliver 90; Posner 93; Wellman 93].
