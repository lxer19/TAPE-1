Reference: [ADDRCONF] <author> Thomson, S., and T. Narten, </author> <title> "IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration", </title> <booktitle> RFC 1971, </booktitle> <month> August </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: All interfaces on routers MUST have a link-local address. Also, <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref> requires that interfaces on hosts have a link-local address. unspecified address - a reserved address value that indicates the lack of an address (e.g., the address is unknown). <p> It is never used as a destination address, but may be used as a source address if the sender does not (yet) know its own address (e.g., while verifying an address is unused during address autoconfiguration <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>). The unspecified address has a value of 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0. 2.4. Requirements Throughout this document, the words that are used to define the significance of the particular requirements are capitalized. These words are: MUST This word or the adjective "REQUIRED" means that the item is an absolute requirement of this specification. <p> Router Advertisements (and per-prefix flags) allow routers to inform hosts how to perform Address Autoconfiguration. For example, routers can specify whether hosts should use stateful (DHCPv6) and/or autonomous (stateless) address configuration. The exact semantics and usage of the address configuration-related information is specified in <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. Router Advertisement messages also contain Internet parameters such as the hop limit that hosts should use in outgoing packets and, optionally, link parameters such as the link MTU. This facilitates centralized administration of critical parameters that can be set on routers and automatically propagated to all attached hosts. <p> Neighbor Solicitation messages can also be used to determine if more than one node has been assigned the same unicast address. The use of Neighbor Solicitation messages for Duplicate Address Detection is specified in <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. Neighbor Unreachability Detection detects the failure of a neighbor or the failure of the forward path to the neighbor. Doing so requires positive confirmation that packets sent to a neighbor are actually reaching that neighbor and being processed properly by its IP layer. <p> A value of zero means unspecified (by this router). M 1-bit "Managed address configuration" flag. When set, hosts use the administered (stateful) protocol for address autoconfiguration in addition to any addresses autoconfigured using stateless address autoconfiguration. The use of this flag is described in <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. O 1-bit "Other stateful configuration" flag. When set, hosts use the administered (stateful) protocol for autoconfiguration of other (non-address) information. The use of this flag is described in [ADDRCONF]. Reserved A 6-bit unused field. <p> The use of this flag is described in <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. O 1-bit "Other stateful configuration" flag. When set, hosts use the administered (stateful) protocol for autoconfiguration of other (non-address) information. The use of this flag is described in [ADDRCONF]. Reserved A 6-bit unused field. It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver. Narten, Nordmark & Simpson Standards Track [Page 19] RFC 1970 Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6) August 1996 Router Lifetime 16-bit unsigned integer. <p> Type | Code | Checksum | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Reserved | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ + + + Target Address + | | | | | Options ... +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- IP Fields: Source Address Either an address assigned to the interface from which this message is sent or (if Duplicate Address Detection is in progress <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>) the unspecified address. Destination Address Either the solicited-node multicast address corresponding to the target address, or the target address. <p> For instance, the prefix might be used for address configuration with some of the addresses belonging to the prefix being on-link and others being off-link. A 1-bit autonomous address-configuration flag. When set indicates that this prefix can be used for autonomous address configuration as specified in <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. Reserved1 6-bit unused field. It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver. Narten, Nordmark & Simpson Standards Track [Page 29] RFC 1970 Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6) August 1996 Valid Lifetime 32-bit unsigned integer. <p> The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent) that the prefix is valid for the purpose of on-link determination. A value of all one bits (0xffffffff) represents infinity. The Valid Lifetime is also used by <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. Preferred Lifetime 32-bit unsigned integer. The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent) that addresses generated from the prefix via stateless address autoconfiguration remain preferred [ADDRCONF]. A value of all one bits (0xffffffff) represents infinity. See [ADDRCONF]. Reserved2 This field is unused. <p> A value of all one bits (0xffffffff) represents infinity. The Valid Lifetime is also used by <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. Preferred Lifetime 32-bit unsigned integer. The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent) that addresses generated from the prefix via stateless address autoconfiguration remain preferred [ADDRCONF]. A value of all one bits (0xffffffff) represents infinity. See [ADDRCONF]. Reserved2 This field is unused. It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver. Prefix An IP address or a prefix of an IP address. <p> The Valid Lifetime is also used by <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. Preferred Lifetime 32-bit unsigned integer. The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent) that addresses generated from the prefix via stateless address autoconfiguration remain preferred [ADDRCONF]. A value of all one bits (0xffffffff) represents infinity. See [ADDRCONF]. Reserved2 This field is unused. It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver. Prefix An IP address or a prefix of an IP address. The Prefix Length field contains the number of valid leading bits in the prefix. <p> Indeed, the same prefixes can be advertised for on-link determination and address autoconfiguration by specifying the appropriate flags in the Prefix Information options. See <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref> for details on how autoconfiguration information is processed. Narten, Nordmark & Simpson Standards Track [Page 37] RFC 1970 Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6) August 1996 6.1. Message Validation 6.1.1. Validation of Router Solicitation Messages Hosts MUST silently discard any received Router Solicitation Messages. <p> MUST be no less than 3 seconds and no greater than .75 * MaxRtrAdvInterval. Default: 0.33 * MaxRtrAdvInterval AdvManagedFlag The true/false value to be placed in the "Managed address configuration" flag field in the Router Advertisement. See <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. Default: FALSE AdvOtherConfigFlag The true/false value to be placed in the "Other stateful configuration" flag field in the Router Advertisement. See [ADDRCONF]. Default: FALSE AdvLinkMTU The value to be placed in MTU options sent by the router. A value of zero indicates that no MTU options are sent. <p> Default: 0.33 * MaxRtrAdvInterval AdvManagedFlag The true/false value to be placed in the "Managed address configuration" flag field in the Router Advertisement. See <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. Default: FALSE AdvOtherConfigFlag The true/false value to be placed in the "Other stateful configuration" flag field in the Router Advertisement. See [ADDRCONF]. Default: FALSE AdvLinkMTU The value to be placed in MTU options sent by the router. A value of zero indicates that no MTU options are sent. Default: 0 AdvReachableTime The value to be placed in the Reachable Time field in the Router Advertisement messages sent by the router. <p> The designated value of all 1's (0xffffffff) represents infinity. Default: infinity. AdvOnLinkFlag The value to be placed in the on-link flag ("L-bit") field in the Prefix Information option. Default: TRUE Automatic address configuration <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref> defines additional information associated with each the prefixes: AdvPreferredLifetime The value to be placed in the Preferred Lifetime in the Prefix Information option, in seconds. The designated value of all 1's (0xffffffff) represents infinity. See [ADDRCONF]. <p> Default: TRUE Automatic address configuration <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref> defines additional information associated with each the prefixes: AdvPreferredLifetime The value to be placed in the Preferred Lifetime in the Prefix Information option, in seconds. The designated value of all 1's (0xffffffff) represents infinity. See [ADDRCONF]. Default: 604800 seconds (7 days) AdvAutonomousFlag The value to be placed in the Autonomous Flag field in the Prefix Information option. See [ADDRCONF]. Default: TRUE The above variables contain information that is placed in outgoing Router Advertisement messages. <p> The designated value of all 1's (0xffffffff) represents infinity. See <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. Default: 604800 seconds (7 days) AdvAutonomousFlag The value to be placed in the Autonomous Flag field in the Prefix Information option. See [ADDRCONF]. Default: TRUE The above variables contain information that is placed in outgoing Router Advertisement messages. Hosts use the received information to initialize a set of analogous variables that control their external behavior (see Section 6.3.2). <p> Outgoing Router Advertisements are filled with the following values consistent with the message format given in Section 4.2: - In the Router Lifetime field: the interface's configured AdvDefaultLifetime. - In the M and O flags: the interface's configured AdvManagedFlag and AdvOtherConfigFlag, respectively. See <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. - In the Cur Hop Limit field: the interface's configured CurHopLimit. - In the Reachable Time field: the interface's configured AdvReachableTime. - In the Retrans Timer field: the interface's configured AdvRetransTimer. <p> The reasons for an address being treated as on-link is specified in the definition of "on-link" in Section 2.1. Prefixes with the on-link flag set to zero would normally have the autonomous flag set and be used by <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. <p> This serves to alleviate congestion when many hosts start up on a link at the same time, such as might happen after recovery from a power failure. If a host has already performed a random delay since the interface became (re)enabled (e.g., as part of Duplicate Address Detection <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>) there is no need to delay again before sending the first Router Solicitation message. <p> Track [Page 54] RFC 1970 Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6) August 1996 If a host sends MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS solicitations, and receives no Router Advertisements after having waited MAX_RTR_SOLICITATION_DELAY seconds after sending the last solicitation, the host concludes that there are no routers on the link for the purpose of <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. However, the host continues to receive and process Router Advertisements messages in the event that routers appear on the link. 7. <p> ADDRESS RESOLUTION AND NEIGHBOR UNREACHABILITY DETECTION This section describes the functions related to Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages and includes descriptions of address resolution and the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm. Neighbor Solicitation and Advertisement messages are also used for Duplicate Address Detection as specified by <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. In particular, Duplicate Address Detection sends Neighbor Solicitation messages with an unspecified source address targeting its own "tentative" address. Such messages trigger nodes already using the address to respond with a multicast Neighbor Advertisement indicating that the address is in use. 7.1. Message Validation 7.1.1. <p> The set of addresses assigned to an interface may change over time. New addresses might be added and old addresses might be removed <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref>. In such cases the node MUST join and leave the solicited-node multicast address corresponding to the new and old addresses, respectively. <p> Receipt of Neighbor Solicitations A valid Neighbor Solicitation where the Target Address is not a unicast or anycast address assigned to the receiving interface, and the Target Address is not a "tentative" address on which Duplicate Address Detection is being performed <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref> MUST be silently ignored. If the Target Address is tentative, the Neighbor Solicitation should be processed as described in [ADDRCONF]. <p> Address is not a unicast or anycast address assigned to the receiving interface, and the Target Address is not a "tentative" address on which Duplicate Address Detection is being performed <ref> [ADDRCONF] </ref> MUST be silently ignored. If the Target Address is tentative, the Neighbor Solicitation should be processed as described in [ADDRCONF]. Upon receipt of a valid Neighbor Solicitation targeted at the node, the recipient SHOULD update the Neighbor Cache entry for the IP Source Address of the solicitation if the Source Address is not the unspecified address.

Reference-contexts: A packet sent to an anycast address is delivered to one of the interfaces identified by that address (the "nearest" one, according to the routing protocol's measure of distance). See <ref> [ADDR-ARCH] </ref>. Narten, Nordmark & Simpson Standards Track [Page 4] RFC 1970 Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6) August 1996 Note that an anycast address is syntactically indistinguishable from a unicast address. Thus, nodes sending packets to anycast addresses don't generally know that an anycast address is being used. <p> Non-transitive reachability means packets from A reach B, and packets from B reach C, but packets from A don't reach C.) Many radio links exhibit these properties. 2.3. Addresses Neighbor Discovery makes use of a number of different addresses defined in <ref> [ADDR-ARCH] </ref>, including: all-nodes multicast address - the link-local scope address to reach all nodes. FF02::1 all-routers multicast address - the link-local scope address to reach all routers. FF02::2 solicited-node multicast address - a link-local scope multicast address that is computed as a function of the solicited target's address.

Reference-contexts: A router acting on behalf of a mobile node that has moved off-link could potentially act as a proxy for the mobile node. ICMP destination unreachable indication - an error indication returned to the original sender of a packet that cannot be delivered for the reasons outlined in <ref> [ICMPv6] </ref>. If the error occurs on a node other than the node originating the packet, an ICMP error message is generated. <p> ICMP Fields: Type 133 Code 0 Checksum The ICMP checksum. See <ref> [ICMPv6] </ref>.

Future versions of this protocol may define new option types. <p> Hop Limit 255 Priority 15 Authentication Header If a Security Association for the IP Authentication Header exists between the sender and the destination address, then the sender SHOULD include this header. ICMP Fields: Type 134 Code 0 Checksum The ICMP checksum. See <ref> [ICMPv6] </ref>. Cur Hop Limit 8-bit unsigned integer. The default value that should be placed in the Hop Count field of the IP header for outgoing IP packets. A value of zero means unspecified (by this router). M 1-bit "Managed address configuration" flag. <p> ICMP Fields: Type 135 Code 0 Checksum The ICMP checksum. See <ref> [ICMPv6] </ref>. Reserved This field is unused. It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver. Target Address The IP address of the target of the solicitation.

Reference: [IPv6-ETHER] <author> Crawford, M., </author> <title> "A Method for the Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks", </title> <booktitle> RFC 1972, </booktitle> <month> August </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: For example, the length for IEEE 802 addresses is 1 <ref> [IPv6-ETHER] </ref>. Link-Layer Address The variable length link-layer address. The content and format of this field (including byte and bit ordering) is expected to be specified in specific documents that describe how IPv6 operates over different link layers. For instance, [IPv6 ETHER]. <p> The procedure for determining the link-layer address corresponding to a given IP multicast address can be found in a separate document that covers operating IP over a particular link type (e.g., <ref> [IPv6-ETHER] </ref>). Each time a Neighbor Cache entry is accessed while transmitting a unicast packet, the sender checks Neighbor Unreachability Detection related information according to the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm (Section 7.3). <p> This rule allows Neighbor Discovery to operate over links with widely varying performance characteristics. For each interface: LinkMTU The MTU of the link. Default: The valued defined in the specific document that describes how IPv6 operates over the particular link layer (e.g., <ref> [IPv6-ETHER] </ref>). CurHopLimit The default hop limit to be used when sending (unicast) IP packets. Default: The value specified in the "Assigned Numbers" RFC [ASSIGNED] that was in effect at the time of implementation. BaseReachableTime A base value used for computing the random ReachableTime value. Default: REACHABLE_TIME milliseconds. <p> If the MTU option is present, hosts SHOULD copy the option's value into LinkMTU if the value does not exceed the default LinkMTU value specified in the link type specific document (e.g., <ref> [IPv6-ETHER] </ref>). Narten, Nordmark & Simpson Standards Track [Page 51] RFC 1970 Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6) August 1996 Prefix Information options that have the "on-link" (L) flag set indicate a prefix identifying a range of addresses that should be considered on-link.

Reference-contexts: The configuration technique for this MUST be documented. Such a switch SHOULD default to allowing unauthenticated messages. Confidentiality issues are addressed by the IP Security Architecture and the IP Encapsulating Security Payload documents <ref> [IPv6-SA, IPv6 ESP] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In IPv4 off-link senders can send both ICMP Redirects and Router Advertisement messages. Placing address resolution at the ICMP layer makes the protocol more media-independent than ARP and makes it possible to use standard IP authentication and security mechanisms as appropriate <ref> [IPv6-AUTH, IPv6-ESP] </ref>. Narten, Nordmark & Simpson Standards Track [Page 15] RFC 1970 Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6) August 1996 3.2. Supported Link Types Neighbor Discovery supports links with different properties. <p> Furthermore, any neighbor can send proxy Neighbor Advertisements as well as unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements as a potential denial of service attack. Neighbor Discovery protocol packet exchanges can be authenticated using the IP Authentication Header <ref> [IPv6-AUTH] </ref>. A node SHOULD include an Authentication Header when sending Neighbor Discovery packets if a security association for use with the IP Authentication Header exists for the destination address. The security associations may have been created through manual configuration or through the operation of some key management protocol.

Reference-contexts: Unlike IPv4, the recipient of an IPv6 redirect assumes that the new next-hop is on-link. In IPv4, a host ignores redirects specifying a next-hop that is not on-link according to the link's network mask. The IPv6 redirect mechanism is analogous to the XRedirect facility specified in <ref> [SH-MEDIA] </ref>. It is expected to be useful on non-broadcast and shared media links in which it is undesirable or not possible for nodes to know all prefixes for on-link destinations. <p> Note that if hosts support manual configuration of a list of default routers, hosts can dynamically acquire the link-layer addresses for their neighbors from Redirect messages. shared media - The Redirect message is modeled after the XRedirect message in <ref> [SH-MEDIA] </ref> in order to simplify use of the protocol on shared media links.
