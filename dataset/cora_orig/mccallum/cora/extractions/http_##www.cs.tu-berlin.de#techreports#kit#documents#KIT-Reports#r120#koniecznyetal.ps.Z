Title: 105 The Impact of Context and Semantic Bias on Constituent Attachment in Reading 1

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of whether conte xtual and semantic properties of a text can guide the initial analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences, which is often claimed to be based purely on syntactic grounds. Sentences with PP-attachment ambiguities, such as He observed the man with binoculars., were investigated in an eye movement experiment. Three factors were varied: First, the context forced either a simple object-NP analysis or a comple x [NP PP] analysis according to referential support (Altmann and Steedman, 1988); i. e. it either contained a unique referent for the object-NP or more than one potential referent, respecti vely ( contextual bias ). Second, verbs and direct-objects were chosen such that the PP fits plausibly either to the verb, or to the NP , with respect to their conceptual properties. Finally , we took advantage from a feature of the German language, namely v ariable verb-placement. Whereas in German main-clauses the finite v erb follows the Vorfeld ( verbsecond), the verb appears at the end in subclauses (verb-final). The most important result is the interaction of conte xtual bias and v erb-placement. In v erb-second sentences increased processing times resulted, if the context supported the [NP PP] reading, whereas in v erb-final sentences the simple-NP supporting context appeared to induce difficulties. This finding imposes problems to parsing models that propose initial analysis capabilities of conte xtual/semantic features, and in general to all models, among them the construal theory (Carreiras and Clifton, 1993), that cannot account for verb-placement effects.

Reference-contexts: Instrumental-PPs are re garded as optional complements. It is unclear , whether slots for optional complements are only constructed on demand, i.e. when the complement is processed <ref> (see Britt et al., 1993) </ref>, or immediately with the corresponding subcategorizer, if it carries a le xically preferred expectation of the complement (F ord et al., 1982). In the first case, an ef fect of PHA is only e xpected during the PP itself.

Reference-contexts: In subclauses (2), ho wever, when the v erb is placed at the end of the clause, subjects sho wed a reliable preference to wards attaching the PP to the preceding NP. Parsing models such as the garden-path theory (see Frazier, 1987) or its current successor construal theory <ref> (Carreiras and Clifton, 1993) </ref> ha ve thus been demonstrated to be empirically inadequate, since they do not predict different attachment preferences when only the occurrence of the v erb at the surf ace has changed, b ut aspects of structural or presuppositional complexity are kept constant. <p> So, again, it seems to be the case that the PP has only been interpreted as non-restrictive in the R=1 context, still remaining NP-modifying. 6.2 Implications for parsing models Construal theory <ref> (Carreiras and Clifton, 1993) </ref> f ails, since it still predicts the same behavior as the former garden-path model for the sentences under investigation here, where PP-attachment is subject to so called primary relations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent studies <ref> (e.g. K onieczny, Scheepers, Hemforth & Strube, 1994) </ref>, PP-attachment preferences could be sho wn to v ary according to different verb placement in German main and subclauses like (1a, b).

Konieczny, B. Hemforth, N. <p> We w ould therefore ha ve 10. Since it is possible, that in German the structures under investigation do not differ in structural complexity, late closure would predict the attachment to the NP in both, verbsecond and verb-final sentences <ref> (see K onieczny, Scheepers, Hemforth and Strube, 1994) </ref>. It should be ob vious that our argument is not weakened by this possibility.
