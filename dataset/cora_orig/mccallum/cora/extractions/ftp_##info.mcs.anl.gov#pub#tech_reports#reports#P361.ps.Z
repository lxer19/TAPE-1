Title: A SUPERLINEAR INFEASIBLE-INTERIOR-POINT AFFINE SCALING ALGORITHM FOR LCP  
Author: R. D. C. MONTEIRO AND S. J. WRIGHT 
Keyword: Key words. infeasible-interior-point methods, monotone linear complementarity problems, superlinear convergence  
Abstract: We present an infeasible-interior-point algorithm for monotone linear complementarity problems in which the search directions are affine scaling directions and the step lengths are obtained from simple formulae that ensure both global and superlinear convergence. By choosing the value of a parameter in appropriate ways, polynomial complexity and convergence with Q-order up to (but not including) two can be achieved. The only assumption made to obtain the superlinear convergence is the existence of a solution satisfying strict complementarity.

For LCP, we mention Wright [7, 8], while Zhang [11] considers a generalized form of the monotone LCP. In a companion paper <ref> [4] </ref>, we describe a method in which all iterates (x k ; y k ) are strictly feasible (that is, (x k ; y k ) &gt; 0 and y k = M x k + q) and search directions are generated by solving the linear system Y k X k <p> In <ref> [4] </ref>, we choose a parameter ffi 2 (0; 1=2) and define the scalars OE k and O k by OE k = y k y k 4 0 @ 0; max x k i &lt;0 jx k i j i y k C and the step length ff k by ff <p> Moreover, the convergence of fx k T y k g to zero is superlinear. Much of the elegance of the analysis for the feasible algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> does not carry through to this infeasible case and the results are slightly weaker here, so we feel that a separate report is needed. <p> Note that N (ffi; j; 0) corresponds to the neighborhood N (ffi; j) that was used in <ref> [4] </ref>. We formally specify our algorithm as follows. <p> Hence, the algorithm in <ref> [4] </ref> is a special case of Algorithm IAS. In the remainder of the paper, we prove that Algorithm IAS produces a sequence of iterates f (x k ; y k )g such that the complementarity gap x k T y k and the residual kr k k converge to zero. <p> Proof. Statements (a), (b), and (c) follow immediately from (1.5) and (2.1). The proof of (d) is essentially given by Monteiro and Wright <ref> [4, Lemma 3.1 (d)] </ref>, if we note in addition that r (1) = 0. We now show that fx k T y k g is a decreasing sequence and that the property of member ship of N (ffi; j; ae) is inherited by successive iterates of the algorithm. <p> In the proof of this result, we make use of the inequality (1 u) 1+ffi 1 (1 + ffi)u + ffiu 2 ; 8u 1; 8ffi 2 (0; 1];(2.2) which is proved by Monteiro and Wright <ref> [4, Lemma 3.2] </ref>. Lemma 2.3. Suppose that (x; y) 2 N (ffi; j; ae) for some ffi 2 (0; 1], j &gt; 0, and ae 0 and that (x; y) is determined by (1.5).

(This assumption was used by the local convergence analysis in Wright <ref> [7] </ref>, for example.) The following assumption is imposed throughout this section. Assumption 1.

We show in [5] that Assumption 1 is in fact necessary for superlinear convergence of Newton based primal-dual algorithms. <p> The key result | that kx k B k and ky k N k are both O (x k T y k ) | is obtained by combining Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 below. In <ref> [7] </ref>, the same result was obtained by combining Lemma 3.4 with a more elementary result in which boundedness of (x k ; y k ) was an essential ingredient. <p> In fact, we can use the techniques of this section to drop the strict feasibility SUPERLINEAR AFFINE-SCALING ALGORITHM FOR LCP 13 assumption from the analysis of <ref> [7] </ref> without affecting the conclusions of the paper (see Wright [9]). After finding the bounds on the steps (x k ; y k ) in terms of the complementarity gap x k T y k , we bound the scalars jOE k j and O k .
