Reference-contexts: Nonlinear problems raise many issues from a computation standpoint. On the one hand, deciding if a set of polynomial constraints has a solution is NP-hard. In fact, Canny <ref> [ Canny, 1988 ] </ref> and Rene-gar [ Renegar, 1988 ] have shown that the problem is in PSPACE and it is not known whether the problem lies in NP. Nonlinear programming problems can be so hard that some methods are designed only to solve problems up to, say, 20 variables.

Reference-contexts: nonlinear equations depicted in [0; 10] and the constants are given by 0.485 0.752 0.869 0.982 5.2095 10.0677 22.9274 20.2153 28.5132 111.8467 134.3884 211.4823 The article [ Ratschek and Rokne, 1993 ] summarizes various attempts to find a solution to this problem using local methods and states In 1974, Cutteridge <ref> [ Cutteridge, 1971 ] </ref> combined local damped Newton-Raphson steps with the conjugate gradient method and a second-order gradient-descent method with eigenvalue determination where the two latter methods were applied to the least squares problem [: : :] Cutteridge emphasized that only the sophisticated combination of the three methods had led to

Reference-contexts: It is not obvious in this case how to interpret these results in a meaningful way. It is also interesting to mention the common belief that proving the existence or uniqueness of solutions is outside the scope of computer algorithms. For instance, Dennis and Schnabel in their excellent text <ref> [ Dennis and Schnabel, 1983 ] </ref> present the three functions f 1 (x) = x 4 12x 3 + 47x 2 60x f 3 (x) = x 4 12x 3 + 47x 2 60x + 24:1 and state It would be wonderful if we had a general-purpose computer routine that would

Reference-contexts: At a very abstract level, Numerica can be viewed as mapping continuous problems into discrete problems, which is exactly the opposite of traditional relaxation techniques (e.g., in integer programming <ref> [ Garfinkel and Nemhauser, 1972 ] </ref> ).

Reference-contexts: This is especially true for small-scale highly nonlinear problems as those found in chemical and electrical engineering where traditional methods are likely to diverge, are unable to locate all solutions or to prove the absence of solutions (a requirement in these problems). Reference <ref> [ Gehrke and Marquardt, 1996 ] </ref> in fact indicates that progress in chemical engineering increases the need for these functionalities. The rest of this extended abstract illustrates the advantages of Numerica and contrasts it with traditional methods.

Reference-contexts: Once nonlinear programming problems are viewed as discrete problems, it is natural to apply consistency techniques such as arc- and path-consistency (e.g., <ref> [ Montanari, 1974; Mackworth, 1977; Mackworth and Freuder, 1985 ] </ref> ) which have been successfully applied in many areas [ Van Hentenryck and Saraswat, 1996 ] .

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, the use of intervals makes it possible to implement global search algorithms for nonlinear programming.

Numerica, and its constraint-solving algorithm, does not aim at replacing local methods. Local methods are extremely effective tools when they apply and are probably the only way to approach large-scale nonlin ear programming problems involving thousands of vari-ables.
