Abstract: Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA 01003-4610 USA CMPSCI Technical Report TR 97-40 Abstract In this paper we present methods to evaluate the benefit of using direct ATM connections (shortcuts) between IP nodes in IP over ATM networks, and we evaluate the benefit of ATM shortcuts for several networks. We model an IP/ATM network with and without ATM shortcuts as two loss networks. We propose a metric, the Network Load Ratio, for network performance comparison, that gives the ratio of the number of flows accepted by two networks at the same network blocking probability. We derive an estimator of this metric, the Asymptotic Load Ratio, that has low computational complexity. We use this estimator as a basis for a methodology for network performance comparison, and use it to evaluate the benefit of ATM shortcuts in several concrete scenarios.

Reference-contexts: Another set of proposals goes one step further and lets the ATM VC, called ATM shortcut, connecting two IP routers, be routed by the ATM network. ATM shortcuts are proposed by NHRP [9] for unicast IP flows, MARS <ref> [1] </ref> for multicast IP flows, and RSVP/ATM [3] for IP flows with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. IP cut-through has proved to be beneficial in experimental systems and commercial products by increasing the average throughput of IP routers embedded in ATM networks. <p> However, this IP/ATM operation mode does not take full advantage of the capabilities of the ATM network. The ATM VCs are constrained to follow a pre-established IP route, which might not efficiently use the resources of the ATM network. Recently, several works <ref> [9, 1, 3] </ref> have proposed using the routing capability of ATM to benefit IP flows. An ATM VC established for an IP flow, called an ATM shortcut, is routed by the ATM network, and is not constrained by the default IP route (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: In such cases, the IP networks are configured as virtual networks over the ATM network infrastructure. The result, overlaid IP/ATM networks, feature a virtual separation between the IP and ATM networks. The recent development and deployment of network layer ATM protocols such as ATM signaling [12] and PNNI <ref> [2] </ref> makes possible an interaction between IP and ATM networks. Recently, research has put forward several proposals to improve the efficiency of IP/ATM networks through an interaction between IP and ATM network layers.

Reference-contexts: The second network, denoted by N16, has 16 nodes, and is an abstraction of a commercial telecommunication network, where the topology, link capacities, link costs and flow load probabilities (only class 1) are given in <ref> [4] </ref>. The topology of N16 is shown in Figure 11. In the first experiment, we treat N17 as an IP network that can be embedded in an ATM network (supra-graph) having any number of nodes and links, with all link capacities being OC3. <p> We perform the same comparison with N16, namely we compute the Asymptotic Load Ratio between the Complete graph with 16 nodes and all link capacities C i = 120, and N16, while both having the same load probabilities, (-k ) k2K (given in Table 14 in <ref> [4] </ref>). The result, A = 1:311, shows a much smaller potential for performance improvement when using ATM shortcuts than N17. <p> Next, we consider N16 as an ATM network that embeds an IP network, as in Figure 13. The set of loads of IP traffic are a subset of the loads of class 1 given in <ref> [4] </ref> that have access nodes that are IP nodes (depicted with thicker lines in Figure 13). We compare again the network performance when the IP flows are routed in IP and ATM topologies respectively.

Reference-contexts: Today, at most of its structural levels (Backbone, WAN, regional Internet Service Providers), the Internet is carried over telecommunication networks that are increasingly deploying ATM technology (e.g., NSF's very High Speed Backbone Network Service, vBNS, <ref> [5] </ref>). In such cases, the IP networks are configured as virtual networks over the ATM network infrastructure. The result, overlaid IP/ATM networks, feature a virtual separation between the IP and ATM networks. <p> Data networks using the IP protocol are currently carried over the telecom networks, but the two networks are virtually separated (such as NSF's very High Speed Backbone Network Service, vBNS <ref> [5] </ref>). It is possible, however, for IP to become aware of the underlying ATM infrastructure and to be able to take advantage of the capabilities of the underlying ATM network.

Reference-contexts: Recently, research has put forward several proposals to improve the efficiency of IP/ATM networks through an interaction between IP and ATM network layers. One proposal <ref> [10] </ref> is to cut through the IP processing of IP packets and transmit the data of an IP flow through a separate ATM virtual circuit (VC). The VC connects two IP routers at the edge of the ATM network, and the route of the ATM VC follows the IP route. <p> Such IP-ATM interaction is investigated in the next section. 2.2 Issues in IP-ATM interaction We consider IP flows transmitted on IP/ATM overlaid networks. We define an IP flow to be (see e.g. <ref> [10] </ref>) a sequence of IP packets having the same (IP source address, IP source port, IP destination address, IP destination port), and being transmitted within a determined time interval. <p> By this definition, every IP packet belongs to an IP flow (see <ref> [10] </ref> for a discussion of this issue). Consider now an ATM network (Fig. 1) where ATM switches are connected through ATM links, and some of the switches are also IP routers. The overlaid IP network consists of these IP routers connected through IP links that are ATM VC connections. <p> For any IP flows, the overhead of IP packet fragmentation/reassembly and processing in each IP router constitutes a bottleneck in their transit. This bottleneck is a per-packet overhead, and its cumulative detrimental effect on the flow's throughput has a higher impact on long lived flows. <ref> [10] </ref> proposes to cut through the IP processing, once the IP route is known (see Figure 1).
