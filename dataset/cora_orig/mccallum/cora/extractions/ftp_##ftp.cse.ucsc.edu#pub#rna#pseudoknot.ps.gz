Abstract: A model based on intersections of stochastic context free grammars is presented to allow for the modeling of RNA pseudoknot structures. The model runs relatively fast, having the same order running time as stochastic context free grammar parsers. The model is shown to be able to perform database searches and find RNA sequences which resemble RNA pseudoknots which bind biotin. The problem domain of RNA biotin binders has significance in the support of the RNA world model of early life on earth.

Reference-contexts: These sequences are important because of their potential support of the 'RNA World' model <ref> [4] </ref>. The RNA World model proposes that much of modern metabolism evolved prior to the evolution of encoded protein synthesis, and that early ribozyme-catalyzed metabolic transformations form the basis of our present protein-catalyzed metabolism. This proposal requires that ribozymes should be able to catalyze a broad range of chemical transformations.

Reference-contexts: The RNA pseudoknot is the representative problem domain for which our models provide a solution. A RNA pseudoknot is formed when bases outside a hairpin structure pair with bases within the hairpin loop to create a second stem and loop structure <ref> [5] </ref>. See figure 1. Pseudoknots have been found in small subunit ribosomal RNA and seem to be very important in its functioning. Pseudoknots have been observed in many structures including telemerases, 7SL RNA, U2 snRNA, group I introns, and viral RNA.

Reference-contexts: Formal language theory deals with sets of strings called languages and different mechanisms for generating and recognizing them [11]. A context free grammar, G, is defined as a 4-tuple: G = (V; ; P; S) <ref> [12] </ref>, where V is a set of nonterminals, is the terminal alphabet, S is the start symbol, and P is a set of productions of the form A ! ff where A 2 V and ff 2 (V [ ) fl . <p> Finding the probability of a observation sequence, O, given a SCFG, G can be done with an extension of the CYK parsing algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>. The CYK algorithm uses a table, T [s; i; j], which stores the probability of nonterminal s deriving the subsequence, O i : : : O j . <p> The basic structure of a pseudoknot can be represented abstractly by the language, fwjw has the form [ i ( j ] i ) j g 1 . Here [; ] and (; ) denote abstract base-paired residues. This language is not context free by the pumping lemma <ref> [12] </ref>. There is NO context free grammar that can generate this language.

Reference-contexts: These estimates are based on frequencies of occurrence of various events, such as the number of times a certain production was used. Computing these estimates for SCFG's can be performed with an algorithm called the inside/outside algorithm <ref> [16] </ref>. Both the inside and outside variables can be computed in O (n 3 ) time. These variables can be used to estimate the probability of a production being used. A more computation-ally efficient SCFG parameter estimation technique has been developed [24].

As the figure shows, there are nonter-minals that generate basepairs, loop positions, and branch productions. David Searls was the first to fully develop the connection between formal language theory and biosequence analysis [26, 27, 25]. <p> This data was used to construct the overall structure of the model. The biotin binder sequences were then used as a training set and parameters of the model were estimated using an extension of the Tree-Grammar EM training algorithm <ref> [23] </ref>. This model was then hand tuned using biological knowledge to capture the structure of the biotin binder sequence without over-fitting the biases which were present in the training sequences.
