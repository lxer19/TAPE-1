Abstract: A short version of this paper was presented at the 1994 Workshop of the Arpa/Rome Laboratories Planning Initiative, held during February 21-25, 1994 in Tucson, AZ. Information Sciences Institute ISX Corporation AI Applications Institute University of Southern California 1165 Northchase Parkway University of Edinburgh 4676 Admiralty Way Marietta, GA 30067 80 South Bridge Marina del Rey, CA 90292 Edinburgh EH1 1HN, Scotland This document is the result of a joint effort to understand what are relevant factors to consider when there are several possible courses of action (COAs) to accomplish a Non-combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) military mission. These relevant factors are useful for generation and evaluation of COAs and provide the basis for a good decision in selecting a COA. The document compiles the relevant factors from the perspective of logistics that are useful to evaluate whether or not alternative proposed COAs can be supported logistically, and which ones seem to be better alternatives compared to the others. The ultimate goal of this joint effort is to use these factors to automate the evaluation and comparison of COAs and use the comparison to determine what are critical aspects of a COA that may be changed to produce a better option with a generative planner. We discuss how we envision using and O-Plan2 for this purpose.

Reference-contexts: COATA concentrates on factors relevant to NEO operations from a J-3 (operations) perspective. This papers focuses on a complementary J-4 (logistics) perspective. 8 expect expect expect 7.1 O-Plan2 7.2 EXPECT 7 Generating Qualitatively Different Plans: EXPECT and O Plan2 COAST is a COA selection tool developed at NRaD <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> . COAST produces a COA selection matrix based on a set of criteria chosen and ranked by the user according to their relevance for the situation. COAST does not evaluate the criteria: the user must estimate them manually and enter the result.

Reference-contexts: The planner would be tasked with different such requirements to produce alternate plans which are qualitatively different. The intent of this document is to add to the PRECiS domain description <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> such that together they provide a rich domain example that is simple enough for enabling technology research, but also that can be realistically evaluated and recognized as addressing real issues. This document attempts to clarify the following issues: 1.

That paper also includes a chart showing how O-Plan relates to other planning systems. Further detail on O-Plan2 is available in <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> . The overall O-Plan2 plan representation and system allows for "tasks" (Missions, constraints, resources, etc) to be explored and compared in a supportive interface for doing plan option analysis.

Reference-contexts: COATA is a COA evaluation tool developed at Rockwell <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> . The main focus of the research at Rockwell is reasoning under uncertainty. The uncertainty in the data is represented with probability distributions used by a decision-theoretical model to evaluate COAs against a set of pre-defined metrics.

Reference-contexts: automation during this phase, more satisfactory COAs will be produced. 2 3 Evaluation Factors for NEO Operations critical factors Agreements and treaties Airfields and air facilities Allied and friendly cooperation American firms overseas Ammunition Communications In the staff estimates process, 23 of the 39 JOPES identified elements of evaluation (EEs) <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> are applicable to most NEO operations and should therefore be considered in the identification and recommendation of a NEO COA. Of these factors, many will remain constant across all COAs and are usually not addressed.

Reference-contexts: The concept development phase is composed of the following steps <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> : 1. The CINC analyzes the mission and the assigned task. The result is a that contains the tasks to be accomplished and the purpose they achieve. These tasks are described by who/what/when/where/why/how. 2.

Reference-contexts: Another important problem is that the generation of alternative courses of action cannot be fine-tuned because of time constraints. Courses of action turn out to be one of three types <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> : 1. conservative, using few forces, 2. use massive forces, 3. take little force with the hope that the operation will succeed anyway. These three types are too gross grain and lie on stereotypical positions of the spectrum of possible alternatives.
