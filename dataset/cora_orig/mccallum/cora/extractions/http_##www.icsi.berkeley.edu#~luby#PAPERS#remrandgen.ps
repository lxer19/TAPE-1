Title: Approximations of General Independent Distributions  
Author: Guy Even Oded Goldreich Michael Luby Noam Nisan Boban Velickovic 
Abstract: We describe efficient constructions of small probability spaces that approximate the independent distribution for general random variables. Previous work on efficient constructions concentrate on approximations of the independent distribution for the special case of uniform boolean-valued random variables. Our results yield efficient constructions of small sets with low discrepancy in high dimensional space and have applications to de-randomizing randomized algorithms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of constructing small sample spaces that "approximate" the independent distribution on n random variables has received considerable attention recently (cf.

The culmination of previous works are constructions of small sample spaces that approximate a constant amount of independence for general random variables (for a brief survey, see for example [11, Luby] or <ref> [1, Alon Babai Itai] </ref>) or that approximate complete independence for identically and uniformly distributed boolean-valued random variables [13, Naor Naor], [2, Alon Goldreich H-astad Peralta], [3, Azar Motwani Naor]). <p> that are k-wise independent approximations for U n;m of size maxfn; mg k , and that are (k; *)-approximations for general P n;m with size (maxfn; k=*g) k , are implicit in many works; a brief survey of some of these constructions can be found in either [11, Luby] or <ref> [1, Alon Babai Itai] </ref>. For constant k and 1=* polynomial in n, this yields a sample space of size polynomial in n. <p> For example, in the analysis of some of the randomized algorithms for graph problems presented in [11, Luby] and <ref> [1, Alon Babai Itai] </ref>, approximate pairwise independence of the random variables suffices. Thus, the construction of a sample space of polynomial size that is a pairwise independent approximation for general P n;m can be used to convert these randomized algorithms into deterministic algorithms. <p> In this subsection, we show this implies S (R n ) * when points in S are mapped in the natural way to [0; 1) n . Using standard constructions (see for example [11, Luby] or <ref> [1, Alon Babai Itai] </ref>), there is a constructible set S with these properties of size polynomial in (n=*) log (1=*) . The first easy observation is that S (R k n;4n=* ) = 0 when points in S are mapped in the natural way to [0; 1) n .

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the previous bound on the sample space size, implicit in the classical work on discrepancy theory (see e.g. [4, Beck Chen] or <ref> [15, Niederreiter] </ref>), is polynomial in n n =*. <p> The discrepancy problem can be stated as follows: given n and *, construct a set S in [0; 1) n with S (R n ) *. As we describe (and as also has been describe before by others, e.g. <ref> [15, Niederreiter] </ref>), there is an close connection between discrepancy and approximating independent distributions of n general random variables. Our primary interest in sets with small discrepancy is that they are universal for the problem of constructing sample spaces that are good approximations for general distributions. <p> Classical work on the discrepancy problem concentrates on minimizing the size of S primarily as a function of 1=* and then secondarily as a function of n [4, Beck Chen], <ref> [15, Niederreiter] </ref>, i.e. the dimension n is thought of as arbitrary but fixed and the goal is to find a set S with size as small as possible as a function of 1=*. <p> In contrast to these new results, the previous known bounds from classical discrepancy theory on the size of an explicitly constructible set S in [0; 1) n with small discrepancy are exponential in n [4, Beck Chen], <ref> [15, Niederreiter] </ref>. It is easy to see that a random set of points S in [0; 1) n of size cn log (n=*)=* 2 for some constant c &gt; 1 has the property that S (R n ) * with high probability.
