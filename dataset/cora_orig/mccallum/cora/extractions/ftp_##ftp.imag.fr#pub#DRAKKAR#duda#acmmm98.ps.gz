Abstract: The WWW has become a major publishing medium. To integrate synchronized multimedia in this environment in a seamless way we propose temporal extensions to HTML and an execution architecture to support these extensions. We have created a prototype using Java and adapted it to make it run in a standard browser.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We have defined temporal extensions to HTML <ref> [1] </ref> to allow specification and playback of synchronized multimedia presentations in the WWW context. Components of such presentations may include continuous multimedia data (audio and video clips) either stored on WWW servers or coming from live-data sources.

Reference-contexts: The extensions are based on three concepts: hypertime links for temporal composition, common time bases for close lipsync synchronization between media objects, and dynamic layout for positioning and movement. We have also defined an execution architecture <ref> [2] </ref> to play back documents specified using the temporal extensions to HTML. The architecture is based on three concepts that directly support these high level concepts: synchronization events, synchronization managers, and synchronizable media objects.
