Abstract: notion of lenses or filters that can be manipulated on the data surface to change the appearance of objects seen within the lens. In addition, Lucas et. al. [6] uses a kind of local tool in their Visage system by allowing the user to place a dynamic query slider directly on the data surf ace. Finally, Meyer [5] demonstrated some e xamples of local tools that were generated on the f ly by sketching in his Etcha-Pad system. PAD++ LOCAL TOOLS The current implementation of local tools in P ad++ is a preliminary investigation designed for the KidPad application previously mentioned (Figure 1). We have implemented local tools for dra wing, erasing, selecting, creating hyperlinks, and for copying clipart out of a scrapbook. In addition, there is a special toolbox for organizing tools. The current user interactions with local tools are as follows. When KidPad starts up, the tools are lined up on the bottom of the screen. The toolbox is f ixed at the bottom right. When the user pans or zooms, the tools stay on the surface, and thus pan or zoom with e verything else. The toolbox, however, stays in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Clicking on the toolbox brings back the tools from wherever they were left on the P ad++ surface and lines them up on the bottom of the screen. Clicking on a tool picks it up so it can be used. Double-clicking drops the tool so another tool can be picked up. The scrapbook has special interactions. It is a slider that shows the items in the scrapbook one at a time as the slider is moved. Clicking on an item in the scrapbook with the selection tool automatically mak es a copy of the item that can then be positioned an ywhere on the work surface. USER TESTING We tested the local tools in KidPad at Lowell Elementary School in Albuquerque, New Mexico with two fourth grade classes on an ongoing basis. We tested KidPad one hour a week for eight weeks (for each class). W e rotated through the students, asking all 40 students to use KidPad in repeated tasks. We also tested KidPad at CHI96 in the new CHIKids program, where 12 children aged 4-13 used KidPad for two hours. Through this experience, we learned that local tools work. Even very young children learned to use them v ery quickly with minimal instruction, and man y of them reported preferring local tools over the tool palette. We also received valuable feedback from the kids about the tools usability. The biggest problem is that children (and many adults for that matter) ha ve a difficult time double-clicking to drop the tool. We plan to make it possible to drop a tool with a single click on the toolbox. Also, a single click on any other tool will drop the first one, and pick up the second one. The lack of local tools for panning and zooming w as also a problem. Children (and again, many adults) have trouble using the three-button mouse we currently use for zooming. Small hands cant access all three buttons easily, and few people can remember which button zooms in which direction. To this end, we are de veloping local tools with animated icons to control panning and zooming which will allow Pad++ to be controlled with a one button mouse. CONCLUSION Our preliminary results show that local tools are a promising new way to interact with computer applications. While we are improving the details of our implementation, a wide range of users, including very young children were able to use local tools ef fectively and reported enjoying them. In addition to improving the existing local tools, we are working on expanding the tool set and or ganization. We are planning on providing multiple groups of tools that can easily be accessed, modified, and shared with other users. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We wish to thank all the children in Alb uquerque, NM and at CHIKids who supported our efforts in testing local tools. In addition, we wish to thank Jon Meyer, one of our collaborators at the New York University Media Research Laboratory for discussions about local tools, while he independently did related work on Etcha-Pad.
