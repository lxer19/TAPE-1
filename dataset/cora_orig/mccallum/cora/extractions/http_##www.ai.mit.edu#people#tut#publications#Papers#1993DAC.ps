Abstract: In this experimental examination, the behavior of harmonic-drive kinematic error, compliance, and friction was characterized. In particular, kinematic error was confirmed to appear primarily at frequencies that were multiples of the wave-generator rotational velocity, and static stiffness measurements were found to yield a range of profiles that could be highly nonlinear. Additional measurements of static and dynamic friction demonstrated that energy dissipation in harmonic drives varies nonlinearly with velocity and can escalate during system resonance. Due to the inseparable interaction between harmonic-drive kinematic error, compliance and friction, transmission properties often showed significant variation with operating conditions and were difficult to characterize accurately. In this exploration, experimental measurements were used to characterize the behavior of three important transmission attributes: kinematic error, compliance, and friction. From these results, it was confirmed that the primary kinematic-error signals vary periodically at multiples of the wave-generator rotational frequency and are produced by gear-tooth placement errors on the flexspline and circular spline. Static stiffness measurements revealed that harmonic-drive compliance can show a wide range of behavior that often escapes catalog estimates. Finally, measurements of transmission losses illustrated the nature of static and dynamic friction and revealed the presence of enhanced friction from resonance vibration during harmonic-drive operation. In general, friction and flexibility in harmonic drives were found to be highly nonlinear and very This paper presents a brief overview of the experimental apparatus followed by a discussion of harmonic-drive kinematic error, compliance, and friction results. For each of these transmission properties, typical behavior will be outlined, comparisons will be made to catalog estimates, and factors which influence the observed behavior will be exposed. Based on this understanding, conclusions will be drawn to justify the observed behavior. In total, three different harmonic-drive testing stations were used to monitor the behavior of three different harmonic drives. A cross-sectional view of one of these stations is shown in figure 1. As illustrated in this drawing, the wave-generator of sensitive to changes in environmental and operating conditions.
