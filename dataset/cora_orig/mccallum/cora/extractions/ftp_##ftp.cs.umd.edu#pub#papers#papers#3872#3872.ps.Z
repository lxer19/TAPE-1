Abstract: This paper describes a collaborative effort to explore user needs in a digital library, develop interface prototypes for a digital library, and suggest and prototype tools for digital librarians and users at the Library of Congress (LC). Interfaces were guided by an assessment of user needs and aimed to maximize interaction with primary resources and support both browsing and analytical search strategies. Tools to aid users and librarians in overviewing collections, previewing objects, and gathering results were created and serve as the beginnings of a digital librarian toolkit. The design process and results are described and suggestions for future work are offered. Digital Libraries (DL) offer new challenges to an emerging breed of digital librarians who must combine the principles and practices of information management with rapidly evolving technological developments to create new information products and services. This paper describes a collaborative effort to explore user needs in a digital library, develop interface prototypes for a digital library, and suggest and prototype tools for digital librarians and users at the Library of Congress (LC). Over a two-year period, a team of designers from the University of Maryland worked with LC staff to develop the interfaces and tools for the LC National Digital Library Program. The interfaces were designed according to the principles that users should maximize their interactions with information resources and minimize their attention to the system itself, and that both browsing and search strategies should be supported. These principles were manifested in the following specific design goals: Minimize disorientation by reducing navigation (e.g., minimize scrolling and jumping, flattening hierarchy) This paper provides background on digital libraries and the LC National Digital Library Program, describes the overall collaborative project, focuses on the iterative design of the interfaces and tools for a special collection, and concludes with a discussion of research and development needs. Digital Library Research and Development Digital libraries are the logical extensions and augmentations of physical libraries in the electronic information society. Extensions amplify existing resources and services and augmentations enable new kinds of human problem solving and expression. High levels of attention and funding were first given to digital libraries in the early and mid 1990's, leading to a plethora of visions and projects invariably driven first by finding ways to apply the many technologies developed in the 1980's and second by desires to create new technologies for managing distributed information resources (see April 1995 issue of Communications of the ACM for descriptions of various DL projects and the May 1996 issue of IEEE Computer for descriptions of six prominent projects). In some cases, notably the efforts of national libraries or large academic libraries, efforts focused on extending access to existing collections through digitization and network access. At present, digital library projects have focused on developing digital collections and providing rather limited access services.

Reference-contexts: Scope allows users to define where to search, attributes let users enter text (what to search on) and define fields, results allows users to set the number of hits and set sort settings, and variants give help to users on formulating the query <ref> (Shneiderman, Byrd, & Croft 1997) </ref>. In the toolbar of the left side of the screen, the search tab is a rather complex box with entry fields and multiple buttons.

Reference-contexts: A list of videos is shown with the first or most representative frame of each video. When a video is selected users can see a preview made of selected frames of the video. Several research groups are working on techniques to extract representative or key frames from videos <ref> (e.g. Wactlar, 1996) </ref>. For this prototype, an algorithm developed at the University of Maryland Center for Automation Research (Kobla et al. 1996) was used to parse MPEG-compressed video sequences into shots based on their physical structure and further into scenes by identifying changes in content and camera motion.
