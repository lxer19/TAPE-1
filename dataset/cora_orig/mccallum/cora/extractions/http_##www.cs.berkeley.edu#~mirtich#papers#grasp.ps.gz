Abstract: We consider the problem of finding optimum force closure grasps of two and three-dimensional objects. Our focus is on grasps which are useful in practice, namely grasps with a small number of fingers, with friction at the contacts. Assuming frictional contact and rounded finger tips|very mild assumptions in practice|we give new upper (and lower) bounds on the number of fingers necessary to achieve force closure grasps of 2-D and 3-D objects. We develop an optimality criterion based on the notion of decoupled wrenches, and use this criterion to derive optimum two and three finger grasps of 2-D objects, and optimum three finger grasps for 3-D objects. We present a simple O(n) algorithm for computing these optimum grasps for convex polygons, a O(n log n) algorithm for non-convex polygons, and an O(n 3 ) algorithm for polyhedra. In studying these optimum grasps, we derive several interesting theoretical results concerning grasp geometry.

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, our criteria lead to very simple, easily characterized grasps, which seem intuitively to be good grasps. 1.1 Related work The force closure problem was introduced into the robotics literature by Lakshminarayana, who established bounds on the minimum number of fingers needed to achieve force closure of rigid bodies <ref> [Lak78] </ref>. Mishra, Schwartz, and Sharir derived theoretical bounds on the minimum number of fingers required to hold bodies at equilibrium, with no friction; they also give linear time algorithms to synthesize such grasps for polygonal and polyhedral objects [MTS87].

Reference-contexts: However, for small enough friction angles, the parallel/colinear and equilateral grasp conditions again become necessary. Proof of the following theorem may be found in <ref> [MC93] </ref>. Theorem 3 If &lt; 30 ffi , then under the L 1 norm, parallel and colinear grasps maximize Q 1 among all two finger grasps. If &lt; 10 ffi , then under the L 1 norm, equilateral grasps maximize Q 1 among all three finger grasps. <p> Then the plane defined by the p i is normal to the axis of the prism, and the inward normals on O at the p i all lie in that plane, and are in fact coincident. Sketch of proof: (See <ref> [MC93] </ref> for a more complete proof.) The proof is the 3-D analog of the proof of theorem 2. <p> be shown that the hardest unit moment in the grip plane for g to resist is one which is parallel to the longest side of T , and that g's ability to resist such a moment is proportional to the length of the altitude to this side of T (see <ref> [MC93] </ref> for details). In short, g's ability to resist (worst case) moments in the grip plane is proportional to the minimum altitude of the triangle formed by the contact points.

Reference-contexts: The accepted wisdom is that three (hard) fingers are required for a force closure grasp of a 2-D object, and four fingers are required to grasp a 3-D object <ref> [MNP90] </ref>. However, using a realistic model (rounded fingers and static friction at the contacts) we show that any 2-D object can be grasped with two fingers, and any 3-D object with three fingers. <p> Our method is similar, although we consider a larger subset of wrench space, and also obtain results for three-dimensional objects. With Ni, they also proved that under very general conditions, force closure friction grasps of 2-D and 3-D objects can be obtained with three and four fingers, respectively. <ref> [MNP90] </ref>. We lower each of these bounds by one finger through a smoothness assumption that is borne out in practice because of rounded fingertips.
