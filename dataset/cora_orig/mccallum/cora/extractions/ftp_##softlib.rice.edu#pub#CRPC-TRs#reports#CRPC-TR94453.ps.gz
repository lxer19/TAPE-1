Abstract: Iterative substructuring methods form an important family of domain decomposition algorithms for elliptic finite element problems. A p-version finite element method based on continuous, piecewise Q p functions is considered for second order elliptic problems in three dimensions; this special method can also be viewed as a conforming spectral element method. An iterative method is designed for which the condition number of the relevant operator grows only in proportion to (1 + log p) 2 : This bound is independent of jumps in the coefficient of the elliptic problem across the interfaces between the subregions. Numerical results are also reported which support the theory.

Reference-contexts: Our basic result has previously been announced in Pavarino [44] and Pavarino and Widlund [45]. Important progress has previously been reported, for problems in two dimensions, by Babuska, Craig, Mandel, and Pitkaranta <ref> [1] </ref>, in which polylogarithmic bounds for some methods are proved; see also Pavarino [42] for results in two dimensions, which are similar to those of this paper. Early experimental work is reported in Babuska and Elman [2]. <p> Separating variables. It is clear from the work of Babuska, Griebel, and Pitkaranta [3], Babuska, Craig, Mandel, and Pitkaranta <ref> [1] </ref>, and others that the choice of bases for the different subspaces is quite crucial for p-version finite element methods and for the design of good preconditioners. Several different sets of basis functions have been suggested and some of them have been implemented in industrial codes. <p> For our analysis, we will select a particular set of basis functions; see however Subsection 6.2 for a discussion of how our algorithm can be used more generally. Our subspaces are constructed from several sets of special polynomials on the interval <ref> [1; +1] </ref> that will be introduced in Subsection 4.2. We note that similar sets of functions have been used in the work of Babuska, Griebel, and Pitkaranta [3] and Canuto and Funaro [14]. <p> Let u (x; y; z) = X (x)Y (y)Z (z); then (2) becomes X 00 = Y Z 00 = + ; Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: local subspaces is in fact very natural for the finite element space considered in this paper since any basis function, except those of the vertices, typically is associated with either the interior of the region, or the interior of a face or an edge; see, e.g., Babuska, Griebel, and Pitkaranta <ref> [3] </ref>. In such a case, all elements of the local spaces vanish at the vertices. <p> Separating variables.

We briefly describe this method, in order to motivate what follows.

Reference-contexts: A number of domain decomposition methods 2 for spectral elements have been considered by Fischer and Rtnquist [25] and Rtnquist [47, 48]; for a general introduction to spectral element methods, we refer to Maday and Patera [35] and Bernardi and Maday <ref> [7] </ref>. However, we know of no previous theoretical results that show only polynomial growth in log p for problems in three dimensions. <p> We note that it is known that the use of Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre quadrature results in a coefficient matrix that is uniformly spectrally equivalent to the stiffness matrix derived from the Galerkin procedure considered here; see Bernardi and Maday <ref> [7] </ref>. It therefore appears likely that our algorithm could also be of use for such methods. 2.

We can use the fact that our algorithm is defined primarily by our subspaces and bilinear forms.

Reference-contexts: The preconditioners are constructed from solvers for local problems and, in addition, a solver of a coarse problem similar to that used in a multi-grid algorithm. However, the global, coarse problem can be quite exotic; see, e.g., Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [20] </ref> and Widlund [52]. When an iterative substructuring method is used, data is only exchanged between neighboring local problems through their boundary values. <p> Early work on iterative substructuring methods focused on the h-version finite element methods; see, e.g., Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [10], Dryja [19], Dryja and Widlund [21], and Smith [49, 50, 51] for work on three-dimensional elliptic problems. A recent paper by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [20] </ref> summarizes our knowledge of the h-version case. The best of these results show that the condition number of the relevant preconditioned operator grows only linearly with the logarithm of the number of degrees of freedom of an individual subregion. <p> Thus, any block-Jacobi method can be viewed as an additive Schwarz method based on a direct sum of subspaces. There are also Gauss- Seidel-like, multiplicative, as well as hybrid Schwarz algorithms; cf. Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [20] </ref> for a general discussion. Using the estimates of this paper, we can obtain strong results for a number of these alternative algorithms in a completely routine way. 4 3. A choice of subspaces. <p> much larger energy is given by our vertex basis functions introduced in Subsection 4.3; see further Lemmas 4.1 and 5.4 i) from which a growth on the order of p 2 can be obtained.) For piecewise linear finite elements, this point is discussed in detail in Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [20] </ref> where remedies, and their consequences, are also discussed. As in the case of h-version finite elements, we thus consider several important geometric objects: interiors, faces, edges, and vertices and subspaces directly related to them. <p> It is known from previous work that it is crucial to include the constants in this coarse, global space; cf. Mandel [37], or Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [20] </ref>. We must therefore make sure that an element of V 0 , which is constant on the wire basket of an element, takes on the same constant value everywhere in the element; see the next section where further details are provided on all the spaces. <p> Such a choice of bilinear form leads to a coarse problem with only one essentially global degree of freedom, c j ; per element. These values are found by solving a linear system of finite difference type; cf. Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [20] </ref>. In addition, a larger linear system, with a convenient diagonal matrix, is solved to find all the degrees of freedom related to the wire basket. The following is the main result of the paper. Theorem 3.1. <p> However, this operator will not reproduce constants; see Figures 5 and 6. It is known that the bound for the condition number then must depend on the number of subregions; cf. Mandel [37], or Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [20] </ref>. In order to overcome this difficulty, we construct the function F = 16 Fig. 5. <p> be obtained by subassembly: b S = I 0 ! 0 b S W W I R T ! Therefore b S 1 S = i b S 1 F i S + R 0 W W R T where R 0 = (R; I); see Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [20] </ref>. We have thus obtained an additive preconditioner, with independent parts associated with each face and the wire basket; see Fig. 8 for the sparsity patterns of S (j) and the preconditioner b S (j) using our basis functions. 29 6.2.

Reference-contexts: Early work on iterative substructuring methods focused on the h-version finite element methods; see, e.g., Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [10], Dryja [19], Dryja and Widlund <ref> [21] </ref>, and Smith [49, 50, 51] for work on three-dimensional elliptic problems. A recent paper by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [20] summarizes our knowledge of the h-version case.

Reference-contexts: In this study, we use the block-Jacobi framework but there is also a more general theory; see Dryja and Widlund <ref> [22] </ref>. Thus, any block-Jacobi method can be viewed as an additive Schwarz method based on a direct sum of subspaces. There are also Gauss- Seidel-like, multiplicative, as well as hybrid Schwarz algorithms; cf. Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [20] for a general discussion.

Reference-contexts: When an iterative substructuring method is used, data is only exchanged between neighboring local problems through their boundary values. In this they differ from the Schwarz methods that use overlapping subregions; see, e.g., Dryja and Widlund <ref> [23, 24] </ref> for a discussion of recent work on this other major family of methods. We also note that similar results, for higher order methods and both two and three dimensions, are given in Pavarino [43, 42].

K T = K &gt; 0, a property inherited from the bilinear form a (; ). Here we view our iterative substructuring method as a block-Jacobi/conjugate gradient method; see Dryja and Widlund <ref> [24] </ref>. The stiffness matrix K is preconditioned 3 by a matrix K J ; which is the direct sum of diagonal blocks of K: We can also replace some of these blocks by spectrally equivalent (or almost spectrally equivalent) block matrices in order to decrease the cost of the computation. <p> Dryja and Widlund <ref> [24] </ref>. The most challenging part of our work is to provide an upper bound of this Rayleigh quotient.

[8, 9], Cai, Gropp, and Keyes [12, 13], Cowsar, Mandel, and Wheeler [18], Gropp and Smith [30], Mandel [39, 41, 40], and Smith <ref> [51] </ref>. <p> Early work on iterative substructuring methods focused on the h-version finite element methods; see, e.g., Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [10], Dryja [19], Dryja and Widlund [21], and Smith <ref> [49, 50, 51] </ref> for work on three-dimensional elliptic problems. A recent paper by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [20] summarizes our knowledge of the h-version case. <p> While doing so, we also develop a number of technical tools, which are likely to be useful in future studies of other domain decomposition algorithms. We note that the method considered in this paper is directly inspired by a method developed by Smith <ref> [50, 51] </ref> for the h-version. Our basic result has previously been announced in Pavarino [44] and Pavarino and Widlund [45]. <p> Both of these matrices are singular with the same null space; only the space orthogonal to this one-dimensional space is relevant in our analysis. We have carried out a series of MATLAB 4.0 experiments, which closely parallel similar work by Smith <ref> [51] </ref> for the case of piecewise linear elements. We note that Smith also reports on full-scale experiments on multi processor systems with his algorithm. In our tables, S denotes the part of the stiffness matrix attributable to the discrete harmonic part of the space and b S is its preconditioner. <p> It is interesting to note that the condition number estimates obtained with this original wire basket block quite closely approach those obtained by Smith <ref> [51] </ref> for the traditional seven point finite difference scheme, with the same number of degrees of freedom, as the size of the local problem increases. Thus, for the cases which correspond to p = 7; 8 and 9, Smith reports condition numbers of 15:86; 17:59 and 19:23; respectively.

Reference-contexts: The preconditioners are constructed from solvers for local problems and, in addition, a solver of a coarse problem similar to that used in a multi-grid algorithm. However, the global, coarse problem can be quite exotic; see, e.g., Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [20] and Widlund <ref> [52] </ref>. When an iterative substructuring method is used, data is only exchanged between neighboring local problems through their boundary values.
