Reference-contexts: Two such algorithms for solving parabolic partial differential equations have appeared recently in the literature: the multigrid waveform relaxation method, and the time-parallel multigrid method. The multigrid waveform relaxation method, also called multigrid dynamic iteration method, was developed by Lubich and Ostermann in <ref> [13] </ref>. It is based on waveform relaxation, a continuous-in-time iterative method for solving large systems of ordinary differential equations. When applied to the system of ordinary differential equations derived by spatial semi-discretization of a parabolic problem, waveform relaxation results in an iterative method that is slowly convergent. <p> Lubich and Ostermann showed that the basic waveform relaxation process can be accelerated by using the multigrid idea, in a very similar way as standard iterative solvers for elliptic problems are accelerated by using multigrid. In <ref> [13] </ref> they illustrate their theoretical results by computations with a model problem, the heat equation. Later on, the method has been applied successfully to a variety of more complex parabolic problems, like a nonlinear heat-conduction and a chemical reaction-diffusion problem ([17]), and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations ([14]). <p> In the case of a very large h , the sets of BDF1 and BDF2 equations are essentially decoupled in time, and correspond to sets of (almost) independent discrete boundary value problems. 2.2. The multigrid methods. The multigrid waveform relaxation method (in its discrete-time version, <ref> [13, p. 227] </ref>) and the time-parallel multigrid method can both be considered as multigrid methods operating on h , a grid extending in space and time. For a given fine grid, both methods solve the same set of equations at the same set of grid points. <p> The two-grid waveform relaxation method. The waveform relaxation diagrams in Fig. 2 can be understood by relating the Fourier analysis results to convergence results for waveform relaxation methods, published in <ref> [13, 16, 19] </ref>. The Fourier analysis is an approximate analysis for initial boundary value problem (1). It becomes an exact analysis when the boundary conditions and the initial condition are replaced by a spatial periodicity and a time-periodicity condition. <p> As such, determined by the Fourier analysis approaches a limiting value. This limit is the spectral radius of the discrete-time initial value waveform relaxation operator, <ref> [13, p. 20] </ref>. For the Crank-Nicolson method, set becomes the imaginary axis, and the limit is independent of h . <p> The height of the plateau observed in the -curves for the Crank-Nicolson method is given by 0:1624, which is, indeed, exactly the value found by the initial value waveform relaxation model problem analysis in <ref> [13] </ref>. For the BDF1 and BDF2 methods, the limiting continuous depends on the particular value of t, or, equivalenty, when n x is fixed, on the value of h . This shows up clearly in Fig. 3.
