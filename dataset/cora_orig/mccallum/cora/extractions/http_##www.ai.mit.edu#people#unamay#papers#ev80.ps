Abstract: We describe the preliminary version of our investigative software, GGE Generative Genetic Explorer, in which genetic operations interact with Au-toCAD to generate novel 3D forms for the architect. GGE allows us to asess how evolutionary algorithms should be tailored to suit Architecture CAD tasks.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An evolutionary process exemplifies the "explore, evaluate and refine" subprocesses of architectural design and its overall non-linear nature. We report on Generative Genetic Explorer (GGE), an evolution-based software system that we have developed and interfaced with Au-toCAD <ref> (Autocad 1995) </ref>. Presently, GGE is an investigative platform for assessing Alife CAD tool issues. Ultimately GGE is intended to be used during the initial stages of the design process when form is being explored through the use of visual models.

Reference-contexts: In GGE we gave such power to the architect and facilitated the architect's sense of control by using a transformation language that the architect understood. Genotype coding: Following the genetic programming (GP) style <ref> (Koza 1992) </ref>, in GGE a transformation is a primitive program element. It consists of a name and a list of the actual parameters for invoking the transformation. The initial form portion of the genotype is never subject to genetic variation (i.e. crossover or mutation) but the transformation sequence is.

Reference-contexts: He proposes "Evolutionary Architecture". GGE, like Evolutionary Architecture, is an attempt to exploit evolution, though in its present form, it lacks the complex morpho-genesis process of Evolutionary Architecture. Another related example is <ref> (Rosenman 1996) </ref>. An example of an Alife CAD tool in the architectural domain is (Bucci 1997). This genetic algorithm system evolves virtual spaces. Two structural elements of the 3D space are parameterized in terms of volume and location.
