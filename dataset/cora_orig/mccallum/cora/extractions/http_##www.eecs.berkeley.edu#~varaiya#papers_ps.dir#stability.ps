Abstract: Hybrid systems combine discrete and continuous behavior. We study properties of trajectories of a rectangular hybrid system in which the discrete state goes through a loop. This system is viable if there exists an infinite trajectory starting from some state. We show that the system is viable if and only if it has a limit cycle or fixed point. The set of fixed points is a polyhedron. The viability kernel may not be a polyhedron. However, under a "controllability" condition, the viability kernel is a polyhedron.

Reference-contexts: We need the following lemma. Lemma 2. The set of viable points is convex and compact. Proof. Follows from definition of compactness and convexity. Definition 3. The set K Z of all viable points is called the viability kernel <ref> [2] </ref>, [3]. Theorem 4. The FCHS has a viable point iff it has a fixed point. Proof. Suppose there is a non-empty viability kernel K. Then K is a convex compact set, K Z 1 .

Those questions often are decidable because the hybrid system can be shown to be equivalent (in an appropriate sense) to a finite automaton.

Reference-contexts: The perturbation ffix (i) is multiplied by the scaling factor when k = m. The eigenvalues i ; i = 1; :::; N 1 of G characterize the stability of the single-valued FCHS. The system is hyperbolic if none of the eigenvalues has magnitude 1 <ref> [5] </ref>. 4.2 An Example Consider the following example. There are six discrete states and the continuous state is in IR 3 . The EZs are two-dimensional rectangles with sides parallel to the coordinate axis. The reset map is identity.
