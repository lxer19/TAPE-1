Title: Semantic Tableau for Control of PLTL Formulae  
Author: Akash Deshpande and Pravin Varaiya 
Address: Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720  
Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California at  
Abstract: We describe the propositional linear temporal logic (PLTL) formalism and introduce the notions of observations, actions and control in PLTL. We develop the 0-lag and 0-lead possibly blocking and nonblocking control strategies and describe their properties. We present an algorithm to generate finite semantic tableaux for control of PLTL formulae. The semantic tableau is part of the controller state and at each time it classifies the actions available to the controller into three groups: those that would immediately complete the task, those that would postpone task completion and those that would immediately block task completion for ever. The tableau reflects the syntactic structure of the PLTL formula under consideration. The algorithm yields the tableau for the 0-lag possibly blocking control strategy.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Different approaches to DES controller synthesis have been given in literature (Ramadge and Wonham 1987 [6], DiBenedetto et al 1994 [2], Sipma and Manna 1994 [8], Asarin et al 1995 <ref> [1] </ref>). In our approach (first given in Deshpande 1994 [?]) we build a semantic tableau for the control of system behaviors described in propositional linear temporal logic (PLTL). A semantic tableau for a PLTL formula is an automaton that models the formula.

Reference-contexts: However, a nonblocking strategy may not exist for f. Note that for any y in its domain, ~ U ff f (y) increases with ff while the same cannot be said of U ff f . Fact 1 S U ff f = S cl (f) : See <ref> [3] </ref> for proofs and examples. The largest ff-lead possibly blocking strategy for f, U fff , and the largest ff-lead nonblocking strategy for f, ~ U fff are similarly defined.

It is known that the semantic tableau could be exponentially larger than the wff (Emerson 1990 <ref> [4] </ref>). 2.3 Closure of a Wff For a wff f, the closure cl (f) of f is a wff given as follows. 1. for p 2 P , cl (p) = p; (b) cl (f 1 ^ f 2 ) = cl (f 1 ) ^ cl (f 2 ); 3.
