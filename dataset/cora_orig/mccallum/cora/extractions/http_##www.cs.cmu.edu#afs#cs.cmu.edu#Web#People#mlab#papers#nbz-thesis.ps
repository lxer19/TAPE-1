Reference-contexts: We claim that nonprehensile manipulation is appropriate for exactly these type of tasks. Nonprehensile manipulation is also appropriate in many situations where, rather than force-closure, it is sufficient to ensure that the contact forces resist a specific external wrench. We will call this stable support <ref> [1] </ref>: Definition 1.3 (Stable support) An object is stably supported against gravity (or more generally, any known applied wrench) if the contact configuration balances the gravitational force and the object can resist small perturbations in its pose. <p> This is similar to the work by Brost [21], in that uncertainty in the part's position can be compensated for by an appropriate intial cage, and that uncertainty can be reduced as the cage parameter is decreased until the object is grasped. Abell and Erdmann <ref> [1] </ref> use two finger stable support to plan handoffs of an object between sets of frictionless point fingers. 1.3.3 Nonprehensile Manipulation One of the earliest examples of robotic nonprehensile manipulation is quasistatic pushing in the presence of friction ([58], [21], [53], [69], [20], [56]). <p> A related concern is that of determining stable poses of assemblies in a gravitational field, when those assemblies are not rigidly attached. In this case, we will say that the assembly is stably supported <ref> [1] </ref> against gravity. The problem, both with and without friction, is addressed by Mattikalli, et.al. [61], [62]. <p> One could fix one of the degrees 106 of freedom of the part to be rotation about the z axis, and then orient the part up to rotation about z. Some possibilities for three dimensional systems include * Three or four fingers. Abell and Erdmann <ref> [1] </ref> presented a two finger stable support reorientation planner for convex polygonal planar parts. A three dimensional analogue is no doubt possible. * Four palms arranged as two two-dimensional cones set in perpendicular frames.

Reference-contexts: The emphasis is on determining the relative trajectory and forces between the object and finger during the finger motion. Aiyama, Inaba, and Inoue <ref> [2] </ref> describe manipulation by pivoting, whereby an object is positioned without being fully grasped, but forces are applied in such a way as to "walk" the object into the goal pose. Because the moving contacts are now point contacts, resistance forces due to friction are diminished.

Reference-contexts: Peshkin and Sanderson [69] and Lynch [53] analyze this situation when the pressure distribution is not known. Mani and Wilson, Peshkin, and others ([57], [68], [20], [95], [4], <ref> [3] </ref>) use the mechanics of pushing to design parts orienters or parts filters with a sequence of fences, similar in function to the vibratory bowl feeders and other orienting systems described by Boothroyd, et.al.

Reference-contexts: One could also design a feeder where a moving part comes into contact with moving fences, to perform the same operation that a string of stationary fences would perform serially. That string of stationary fences would be replaced by some smaller number of moving fences. Akella, et.al. <ref> [4] </ref> have begun work on such a system, the One Joint Over a Conveyer (1 JOC) system, which can arbitrarily orient parts on a moving conveyer belt, using a one degree of freedom arm. The resulting design can be more compact than a conveyer with stationary fences. <p> Peshkin and Sanderson [69] and Lynch [53] analyze this situation when the pressure distribution is not known.

This system was further analyzed by Koditschek and Buhler [49].

Reference-contexts: In [54], Lynch analyzes the conditions for desired goal states to be reachable, both for 7 pushing and for dynamic manipulation. In particular, he is interested in the conditions under which a one degree-of-freedom manipulator can take a part to a full-dimensional subspace of goal states. Arai and Khatib <ref> [7] </ref> studied the exploitation of inertial properties of objects for manipulation of objects in ways other than throwing. They base their approach on work by Arai and Tachi [8] in using dynamic coupling to control passive joints.

Reference-contexts: Introduction As for those things which are moved by other things, this must take place in four ways; for locomotions caused by other things are four in kind (pulling, pushing, carrying, and turning)... Aristotle Physics, Book VII <ref> [9] </ref> 1.1 Why Nonprehensile Manipulation? Prehension may be defined as "The act of taking hold, seizing or grasping, as with the hand" (Webster's 3rd International Dictionary). Nonprehensile manipulation, then, can be defined as the manipulation of objects without grasping them.

Reference-contexts: For examples of this frictional indeterminancy, see [62]. To determine if a object is in a guaranteed stable configuration in the presence of friction, however, is computationally intractable <ref> [10] </ref>, whereas potential stability, which can be phrased as a question of cone containment, is no harder than linear programming. 2.3 Centers of Rotation and Frictional Contact Problems Another way of representing the rigid motion of planar objects, which has the advantage of actually being representable in the plane, is as

For a given object/manipulator pose, under the assumption of a force closure grasp, they present, among other things, a way to partition the manipulator joint space into regions of differential motions with different qualitative behavior.

Reference-contexts: Palmar manipulation is somewhat analogous to manipulating an object with the palm of a hand, without using the fingers. Some direct "beans in a funnel" style examples of manipulation are bowl feeders and Automatic Parts Orienting Systems <ref> [14] </ref>, [40], where a large mass of parts in arbitrary orientations are singulated and oriented by their interactions with (in the case of bowl feeders) fences and other obstacles, or (in the case of APOS systems) by an induced vibration and their interaction with pallets of special shapes. <p> Mani and Wilson, Peshkin, and others ([57], [68], [20], [95], [4], [3]) use the mechanics of pushing to design parts orienters or parts filters with a sequence of fences, similar in function to the vibratory bowl feeders and other orienting systems described by Boothroyd, et.al. <ref> [14] </ref>. When pushing a planar lamina, the gravitational and support forces are perpendicular to the plane of interest. Bat juggling [25], [49] may also be considered as palmar manipulation of one (or more) objects, where now gravitational forces also have a component in the plane of interest. <p> A three-dimensional generalization of this planner was presented in [35]. The computational complexity of a simplified version of this tray tilter, and of other parts feeding systems, was analyzed by Natarajan [64]. Examples of nonprehensile parts orienting systems include bowl feeders and Automatic Parts Orienting Systems <ref> [14] </ref>, [40], where a large mass of parts in arbitrary orientations are singulated and oriented by their interactions with (in the case of bowl feeders) fences and other obstacles, or (in the case of APOS systems) by an induced vibration and their interaction with pallets of special shapes.

Reference-contexts: Because the moving contacts are now point contacts, resistance forces due to friction are diminished. Brock <ref> [18] </ref> specifically allows slip in a controlled manner to reorient an object in a three fingered dextrous hand. When the fingers are in general position, the three contacts points define a plane, the grasp plane.

Reference-contexts: Peshkin and others have studied the case of parts along a conveyer belt, with stationary fences along the way to do the orientation [68], <ref> [20] </ref>. One could also design a feeder where a moving part comes into contact with moving fences, to perform the same operation that a string of stationary fences would perform serially. That string of stationary fences would be replaced by some smaller number of moving fences. <p> Abell and Erdmann [1] use two finger stable support to plan handoffs of an object between sets of frictionless point fingers. 1.3.3 Nonprehensile Manipulation One of the earliest examples of robotic nonprehensile manipulation is quasistatic pushing in the presence of friction ([58], [21], [53], [69], <ref> [20] </ref>, [56]). In particular, Peshkin [69] works out the minimum distance which a "fence" (or palm) must push an object so that it will be guaranteed to come to rest aligned with the fence at the end of the motion. <p> Peshkin and Sanderson [69] and Lynch [53] analyze this situation when the pressure distribution is not known. Mani and Wilson, Peshkin, and others ([57], [68], <ref> [20] </ref>, [95], [4], [3]) use the mechanics of pushing to design parts orienters or parts filters with a sequence of fences, similar in function to the vibratory bowl feeders and other orienting systems described by Boothroyd, et.al. [14]. <p> Krishnasamy, et.al. have begun the analysis of APOS pallets, with the goal of automating their design [48]. Peshkin and others have studied the case of parts along a conveyer belt, with stationary fences along the way to orient them [68], <ref> [20] </ref>. Mani and Wilson [57] designed a programmable parts orienting table where a part in an arbitrary and unknown orientation is oriented (without sensors) by the motion of the table, which moves the part into contact with a stationary fence.

Reference-contexts: The configuration of the hand is described as a one-parameter set in such a way that as the parameter is decreased, the fingers approach the part, and ultimately grasp it. This is similar to the work by Brost <ref> [21] </ref>, in that uncertainty in the part's position can be compensated for by an appropriate intial cage, and that uncertainty can be reduced as the cage parameter is decreased until the object is grasped. <p> Abell and Erdmann [1] use two finger stable support to plan handoffs of an object between sets of frictionless point fingers. 1.3.3 Nonprehensile Manipulation One of the earliest examples of robotic nonprehensile manipulation is quasistatic pushing in the presence of friction ([58], <ref> [21] </ref>, [53], [69], [20], [56]). In particular, Peshkin [69] works out the minimum distance which a "fence" (or palm) must push an object so that it will be guaranteed to come to rest aligned with the fence at the end of the motion. <p> Buhler [25] analyses a planar puck juggling system. This system was extended to three dimension by Rizzi [79]. Planar bat juggling for polygonal objects was examined in [98]. 1.3.4 Parts Orienting The work by Brost <ref> [21] </ref> on the orientation of objects by "squeeze grasps" is analogous to palmar manipulation of one object with two hands, with gravity perpendicular to the plane. He finds sets of actions which reliably orient a part in the presence of uncertainty in the part's location.

Reference-contexts: Mirtich, et.al. [63] present variations of quasi-static estimation methods for estimating the pose statistics of dropped objects, as well as the use of dynamic simulation to directly simulate the pose statistics. In his dissertation, Brost <ref> [22] </ref> describes the notion of a half-space invariant. In a system with a half-space invariant, the possible future configurations of a point originally at rest are constrained to lie in some half plane whose boundary goes through the original configuration of the system in configuration space.

Reference-contexts: Fewer frictionless contacts are required for second order immobility than for complete force or form closure. Brost and Goldberg <ref> [23] </ref> describe an algorithm for designing planar fixtures from a modular fixture kit. These fixtures are four-point frictionless form-closure, and can be selected based on arbitrary criteria for optimality.

Reference-contexts: A pure translation has a center 17 of rotation at infinity. The method presented here is based on that given by Brost and Mason <ref> [24] </ref>. Strictly speaking, since we are talking about forces, what we would like is really the center of acceleration: the one point in the plane which is instantaneously unaccelerated due to the action of a particular line of force. <p> This is a standard problem in linear programming, and in certain special cases, may also be easily solved by linear algebra. For planar problems, Brost and Mason <ref> [24] </ref> have shown how to solve this problem graphically, with two-dimensional diagrams. They took advantage of the duality between points in velocity space (centers of rotation) and lines of force in wrench space. <p> We would like to come up with a method for answering this question, at least in the qualitative sense. In Chapter 2, we reviewed some techniques for planar frictional quasistatic analysis, based on those presented in [51], [76], <ref> [24] </ref>, and [32]. We will now apply those techniques to the problem at hand. 48 4.1.1 Friction Cones We will consider a edge resting in two-point contact on a single palm. (See Figure 4.1).

Bicchi, et.al.

This model has the advantage of being relatively simple, although other researchers have shown inconsistencies do exist, particularly if one looks at energy dissipation ([82]).

Reference-contexts: This suggests the possibility of learning the dynamics of the interaction of parts with the palms by observation, and constructing homing sequences from the learned transition graph.

Reference-contexts: As noted, however, F n and F t are not perpendicular, and the cspace friction cone is not symmetric about F n . In fact, F t may actually dip below F t in certain cases, causing the frictional forces to actually "pull" the object into the obstacle.

Definition 2.1 (Cone combination) A cone combination of a set of vectors is the cone formed by all possible nonnegative combinations of the vectors. <p> We would like to come up with a method for answering this question, at least in the qualitative sense. In Chapter 2, we reviewed some techniques for planar frictional quasistatic analysis, based on those presented in [51], [76], [24], and <ref> [32] </ref>. We will now apply those techniques to the problem at hand. 48 4.1.1 Friction Cones We will consider a edge resting in two-point contact on a single palm. (See Figure 4.1).

Reference-contexts: These considerations are important, since the coefficient of friction cannot in general be precisely known. Erdmann <ref> [33] </ref> is also exploring the use of friction and compliance in nonprehensile palmar manipulation. He studies "slide transfers" of objects from a palm to another planar surface (such as another palm), and the different behaviors of the object for different velocities and "transfer angles" of the palm. <p> A friction based system may not be. We will return to these points in Chapter 5, when we will compare our system to another sensorless two palm system <ref> [33] </ref>, which uses frictional grasps. For now, we will present the frictional contact model which we incorporated into our planner. 4.1 Analysis techniques for planar systems A planar system has a three dimensional configuration space: two dimensions for location in the plane, and one for rotation. <p> Let us compare our treatment of friction with the models used in other systems. The two palm manipulation system described by Erdmann in <ref> [33] </ref> assumes an exact knowledge of the coefficient of friction. Starting with the part in a known pose, and known contact configuration with the palms, Erdmann's system splits the orientation space of the palms into sectors, each of which causes the same qualitative behavior of the part (slide, roll, etc.).

Reference-contexts: This type of manipulation, and indeed much of the work on pushing may be considered passive manipulation, in contrast to the more active manipulation explored in the work of Paljug, et.al., and in much research on grasping. Examples of passive manipulation include the manipulation techniques of Trinkle, et.al. ([90], <ref> [36] </ref>, [85], [86]). Their analysis and planning uses the idea of contact formations originally presented by Desai, and incorporated into a planner for dextrous manipulation by Trinkle and Hunter [88]. The work described in this dissertation follows a similar method to Trinkle, et.al.. <p> Of particular interest in the above set of work is Farahat and Trinkle <ref> [36] </ref>, as well as Trinkle and Zeng [91]. Farahat and Trinkle attempt to find upper bounds on the coefficient of friction for which the plans found by a planner using the frictionless assumption will still work in other words, all contacts will slide.

Reference-contexts: They partition the various configurations of contact between the object and fingers into regions where the object will either slide out of the grasp, jam, or be lifted off the support surface when a squeezing force is applied. Kao and Cutkosky <ref> [42] </ref> study the object-finger interaction for the case of a stable (either stably grasped or stably supported) object and fingers in sliding compliant contact with the object. The emphasis is on determining the relative trajectory and forces between the object and finger during the finger motion. <p> However, assuming an exact value for the coefficient of friction is a nontrivial assumption | Kao and Cutkosky note that "the coefficient of friction can easily vary by 30% with changes in surface texture or cleanliness" <ref> [42] </ref> | which we believe will reduce the robustness of the resulting plans. As it is, the planner will produce fewer plans as the frictional upper bound increases, but the plans are guaranteed to be frictionally robust up to that value of friction.

In particular, he is interested in the conditions under which a one degree-of-freedom manipulator can take a part to a full-dimensional subspace of goal states. <p> The experiments with the sphere show that while sensors can get you out of some of the difficulties of frictional uncertainty, they are not a complete cure for the problem. In his dissertation, Lynch <ref> [54] </ref> uses a technique somewhat complementary to ours in dealing with frictional uncertainty. Using a one-degree-of-freedom arm, he tries to find a manipulator trajectory which brings a part from a known initial state to a goal state by executing a sequence of dynamic and stable grasps, throws, rolls and catches.

Reference-contexts: In this case, we will say that the assembly is stably supported [1] against gravity. The problem, both with and without friction, is addressed by Mattikalli, et.al. [61], <ref> [62] </ref>. <p> (to make an analogy with our work: for palms at a fixed relative angle to each other, and a part in a particular equilibrium position in the palms), the orientations of the assembly for which stable support is maintained form a convex region on the surface of a unit sphere <ref> [62] </ref>. We will take advantage of this result in generating our reorientation plans. Of particular interest is the effect of impact dynamics in the manipulation domain. Most previous strategies for planning manipulation tasks have relied on an assumption of quasi-static mechanics in the analysis of the physical system. <p> The question of whether or not an object can move, or must remain stationary, becomes the problem of checking whether or not the vector of applied forces lies within the aggregate cspace friction cone. This condition is actually only potential stability <ref> [62] </ref>: there is some nonnegative combination of frictional contact forces which can balance the applied gravitation force. <p> Unlike in the frictionless case, where a part is stable if and only if the contact forces balance the applied forces, a part in a potentially stable frictional grasp or support is not necessarily guaranteed to be stable. For examples of this frictional indeterminancy, see <ref> [62] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Both power grasps and precision grasps fall into this category. Power grasps are force/form closure grasps. We will follow Nguyen <ref> [65] </ref> in our definitions of force and form closure. Definition 1.1 (Force-closure) A force-closure grasp is defined as a grasp such that an arbitrary force and moment can be exerted on the grasped object through the contacts. Equivalently, any motion of the object can be resisted by contact forces. <p> They develop a conservative method of calculating grasps: independent contact regions. In an independent contact region, any triple of contact points such that there is one contact in each region will give force-closure. These contact regions are a generalization of Ngyuen's <ref> [65] </ref> formulation for two finger frictional force-closure. Ponce and Faverjon's formulation uses a minimum value of the coefficient of friction, min , such that the calculated grasps are force-closure for any coefficient of friction &gt; min .

Reference-contexts: The desired effect is to push with both palms hard enough so frictional forces counteract gravitational forces, but not so hard as to damage the object.

Here, two planar palms are 6 used to manipulate large objects in free space. A primary difference between the work of Paljug and Yun and the work described in this dissertation is the emphasis in the former on force closure. <p> Such brittleness can of course be offset by the use of sensors to detect slipping, which brings up a host of other complexities which are happily avoided by the system presented in the present work. Paljug, et.al. ([66], <ref> [67] </ref>) present just such a system. Their emphasis is on force-closure grasps which are not form-closure, and their specific example is two planar 3-degree-of-freedom manipulators using palms to grasp a large object in a gravitational field. <p> A more significant problem is that, at least for the experimental setup described in <ref> [67] </ref>, orientation error and local surface normal are not directly sensed, but derived from other sensory measurements. The input needed for feedback is hence rather noisy.

Reference-contexts: Peshkin and others have studied the case of parts along a conveyer belt, with stationary fences along the way to do the orientation <ref> [68] </ref>, [20]. One could also design a feeder where a moving part comes into contact with moving fences, to perform the same operation that a string of stationary fences would perform serially. That string of stationary fences would be replaced by some smaller number of moving fences. <p> Peshkin and Sanderson [69] and Lynch [53] analyze this situation when the pressure distribution is not known. Mani and Wilson, Peshkin, and others ([57], <ref> [68] </ref>, [20], [95], [4], [3]) use the mechanics of pushing to design parts orienters or parts filters with a sequence of fences, similar in function to the vibratory bowl feeders and other orienting systems described by Boothroyd, et.al. [14]. <p> Krishnasamy, et.al. have begun the analysis of APOS pallets, with the goal of automating their design [48]. Peshkin and others have studied the case of parts along a conveyer belt, with stationary fences along the way to orient them <ref> [68] </ref>, [20]. Mani and Wilson [57] designed a programmable parts orienting table where a part in an arbitrary and unknown orientation is oriented (without sensors) by the motion of the table, which moves the part into contact with a stationary fence.

Reference-contexts: Abell and Erdmann [1] use two finger stable support to plan handoffs of an object between sets of frictionless point fingers. 1.3.3 Nonprehensile Manipulation One of the earliest examples of robotic nonprehensile manipulation is quasistatic pushing in the presence of friction ([58], [21], [53], <ref> [69] </ref>, [20], [56]). In particular, Peshkin [69] works out the minimum distance which a "fence" (or palm) must push an object so that it will be guaranteed to come to rest aligned with the fence at the end of the motion. <p> Abell and Erdmann [1] use two finger stable support to plan handoffs of an object between sets of frictionless point fingers. 1.3.3 Nonprehensile Manipulation One of the earliest examples of robotic nonprehensile manipulation is quasistatic pushing in the presence of friction ([58], [21], [53], <ref> [69] </ref>, [20], [56]).

Consider a point contact against the edge of a body, as shown in Figure 2.7. Any point to the left of the contact can only be a center of rotation with a positive rotation sense, otherwise the contact will penetrate the body. <p> We would like to come up with a method for answering this question, at least in the qualitative sense.

Reference-contexts: Peshkin and Sanderson [69] and Lynch [53] analyze this situation when the pressure distribution is not known. Mani and Wilson, Peshkin, and others ([57], [68], [20], <ref> [95] </ref>, [4], [3]) use the mechanics of pushing to design parts orienters or parts filters with a sequence of fences, similar in function to the vibratory bowl feeders and other orienting systems described by Boothroyd, et.al. [14].

Reference-contexts: There was, however, no feedback on the contact force, and no direct information on the object's absolute position in the hand. Yoshikawa, et.al. <ref> [96] </ref> also study the use of controlled slip by a three-fingered hand. They determine a unique force that will cause a finger to slip in a desired direction, while maintaining the stability of the object in the grasp. Ponce and Faverjon [71] study three finger, force-closure frictional grasps.

Reference-contexts: Some of the regions identified could include regions where differential motion affects manipulator pose but not object pose, regions where different freedoms of the part remain unconstrained, or regions where there is one-to-one correspondence between manipulator and object velocity. They can also identify allowable and unachievable object motions. Yun <ref> [97] </ref> studies two manipulators with open palm end effectors manipulating an object by having one palm push from one end, and another palm push at the other end.

Reference-contexts: Buhler [25] analyses a planar puck juggling system. This system was extended to three dimension by Rizzi [79]. Planar bat juggling for polygonal objects was examined in <ref> [98] </ref>. 1.3.4 Parts Orienting The work by Brost [21] on the orientation of objects by "squeeze grasps" is analogous to palmar manipulation of one object with two hands, with gravity perpendicular to the plane. <p> In addition to assuming knowledge of the CG and radius of gyration, we will use a rigid body impulsive impact model, as described by [80] and used by [93], [94], and <ref> [98] </ref>, with the mass of the hand being much greater than the mass of the object, so that the change in velocity due to collision takes place entirely in the motion of the object, and the motion of the hand is unaffected.
