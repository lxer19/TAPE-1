Abstract: We present an analysis of routing data collected from approximately 30 Internet sites from around the world. The routing data was collected using traceroute, and maintained and analyzed using a route database in Tcl. The analysis revealed several interesting pathological cases, such as unreachable destinations and traces that fluttered between different paths, that accounted for approximately 6% of the total number of attempted routes. We also calculated metrics designed to show the relative difference between two routing paths, the relative stability of a route, and the number of routes and relative proportion of those routes from a particular source to a destination. We also measured the short-term variance in packet delay; results are shown to agree with earlier studies. Results show that the number of paths taken from a source to destination is relatively small, the entropy of a particular source-destination path is also small, and the difference between distinct paths is not extreme. The stability metric indicates that 90% of the measured routes were stable for 200 hours or less before changing to a new route. We also comment on the impact of these metrics on higher-level protocols such as TCP and resource-allocating quality of service protocols.

Reference-contexts: The stability metric was designed to give different stabilities for these two sequences of modes. The underlying mathematical structure for our stability metric was a 2-state continuous time Markov Chain. (Figure 10). <ref> [And91] </ref> A Discrete-time Markov Chain is a weighed directed graph, where vertices represent distinct output states and edges represent transitions between states. The weight of an edge fi; jg represents the probability that a transition will be made from state i to state j.

Reference-contexts: Quality of service expect certain standards from IP as well. Many quality-of-service protocols depend on stable routes and low variance in latency for good performance. Protocols such as RSVP [LZZ93] and RCAP <ref> [DFZ94] </ref> depend on resource reservations at intermediate routers. If a new path is taken, routers will now receive real-time traffic without guaranteed resources to buffer them, meaning that new resources must be allocated dynamically at the new routers to avoid packet loss.

Reference-contexts: The overhead involved in coordinating so many sites prevented us from collecting this data in time to analyze it for this paper. 3.2 The Data Analysis Tool In order to manage and analyze the traceroute data, we built a tool using Tcl/Tk <ref> [Ous94] </ref> that allows us to create databases with records that correspond to the results of traceroute. In addition, we have built a graphical interface to the data that allows visualization of any path. In designing the tool, we adhered to two main design goals: flexibility and extensibility.
