Abstract: Hit-and-Run algorithms are Monte Carlo procedures for generating points that are asymptotically distributed according to general absolutely continuous target distributions over open bounded regions . Applications include nonredundant constraint identification, global optimization, and Monte Carlo integration. These algorithms are reversible random walks which commonly incorporate uniformly distributed step directions. We investigate direction choice and show that under regularity conditions on the region and target distribution , there exists a unique direction choice distribution, characterized by necessary and sufficient conditions depending on and , which optimizes a bound on the rate of convergence. We include computational results demonstrating greatly accelerated convergence for this optimizing direction choice and for more easily implemented adaptive heuristic rules.
