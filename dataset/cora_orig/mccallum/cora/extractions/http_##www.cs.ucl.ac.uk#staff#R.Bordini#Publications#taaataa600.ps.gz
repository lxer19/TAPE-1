Abstract: This paper focuses on the idea of searching for and using insights from field work practice in social anthropology in making designs that allow a foreign agent to evolve cooperation with a new community. We believe that an anthropological perspective can contribute to complex social simulations and have an important role in MAS interoperability. We comment on our ideas on agent migration, present some initial thoughts on this anthropological approach, mention some of the anthropologists' field work techniques that can be useful in the computational counterpart situation, and describe briefly the application of those techniques to a testbed under development.

Reference-contexts: Examples of field work projects using this approach can be found, for example, in [17] and [12]. 2.3. ANTHROPOLOGICAL METHODS Apart from choosing suitable philosophical concepts of anthropology, we also appreciate that there is a lot to profit from the practical experience of anthropologists in field work <ref> [2] </ref>. This reference confirms that some of the methods we were considering for helping an immigrant agent's adaptation are standard and validated in anthropologists' experience in field work practice with foreign tribes. We describe some anthropological research methods briefly in the subsections that follow. 2.3.1. <p> Only if an anthropologist is successful in establishing rapport in a new community will people not change their behaviour because of his/her presence. The basic idea is that the anthropologist should participate in the normal activities of the community being studied <ref> [2] </ref>. The counterpart of this proposition for autonomous agents is that the agent in process of adaptation to a target society should, as much as possible, take part in the general "problem solving" that is occurring in that society. <p> In general it takes as much as one year for an anthropologist in participant observation to study a community <ref> [2] </ref>. It could be interesting to evaluate the time needed for an agent to study a whole computational society through participant observation and hence to relate time-scales for the human and computational processes. 2.3.2. <p> Participant observation is also important in guiding the anthropologist in asking sensible questions regarding that culture <ref> [2] </ref>. In this respect, we have elaborated some ideas for supporting the adaptation of an immigrant agent apart from the anthropologists' experience. <p> To the extent that features of a society can be engineered, we suggest that designers should incorporate the "novice master" characteristic in the MAS that they specify. 2.3.3. LANGUAGE Bernard <ref> [2] </ref> points out that knowledge of the local language improves the rapport and allows a more reliable check on the accuracy of elicited data. <p> In the cricket exercise (see section 3) one can consider gestures made by players to celebrate a positive achievement or a failure as an example. 2.3.4. FIELD NOTES Field notes are what differentiate field work from mere experience <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus, dealing with field notes in an appropriate manner is also essential to the task of a social anthropologist. <p> The most important kind of notes in the context of the present work are the descriptive notes or ethnographic notes, which are the basic means for capturing details of behaviour and the environment. There is a suggested format for coding them <ref> [2] </ref>, which is: #hf ieldnote numberi hdatei hplacei hname of inf ormanti htopical codesi hcontenti where hplacei and hname of inf ormant may be encrypted for security reasons and htopical co-desi are (either personal or standard) codes for the topics covered in the hcontenti part of the note.

Reference-contexts: TOWARDS ANTHROPOLOGICALLY-BASED ADAPTATION 2.1. BASIC IDEAS It is important to stress one more point in what is new concerning the idea of "migration" of agents.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION We have been dealing with the problem of agent migration among different (mutually unfamiliar) societies, in the context of Multi-agent Systems (MAS). This problem was first presented in [13] and further discussed in <ref> [4] </ref> (see also [6]) and [22]. Our project regards basically the agent adaptation that takes place in such migrations. <p> Also, it is plausible that each society has its own way of perceiving and organising material phenomena in its own environment (see the discussion on Artificial Cultures, section 2.1). As stated in <ref> [4] </ref>, these profoundly different societies | which are at a different level of contrast from that of societies of culturally identical groups (or organisations) of agents (or that of sub-agents composing agents) discussed in the literature mentioned above | are quite likely to be in distinct geographical locations. <p> we consider complex societies, e.g. following the idea of social power [10], the problem here is that not only do agents not know each other well, but they also have limitations on the appreciation of the very structures used to achieve agreement among individuals, namely language | the subject of <ref> [4] </ref> | and culture (see below). <p> importance "..., since language use entails multiple participatory skills, and is one of the most basic modes of access to interaction in social life." This leads to the idea that an immigrant agent must have at least some acceptable level of knowledge of the local language (the initial motivation of <ref> [4] </ref>). In certain circumstances, it is also possible to deal with a very simplified language which could stand for some sort of gesture language that is universally understandable.

Reference-contexts: [19], it is not realistic to expect the existence of foolproof standard means that would allow an agent to interact in every different society, as intended with the Agent Communication Language (ACL) by researchers in the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort (KSE) [19] (we shall present this idea in detail in <ref> [5] </ref>). Furthermore, we think it is interesting from the point of view of social simulation [10] to have different societies using different languages and protocols. Accordingly, it is necessary that agents be able to adapt themselves to different "cultural" contexts, as humans seem to do. <p> We envision that the next extensions should involve following up the idea that an immigrant agent must be able to discover the arrangements for the semantic domains in its target society, due to the dynamics of MAS (seen as autonomous, evolutionary systems). We shall discuss this further elsewhere <ref> [5] </ref>. 2.4. ANTHROPOLOGIST AGENTS AND MIGRATABLE AGENTS We think it is appropriate to present the two sorts of agents that may need to employ the anthropologically-based techniques that we have mentioned above. <p> Such agents are the ones that carry out MAS interoperability in the scenario we have described (which is the subject of <ref> [5] </ref>). 3 Identifying levels of contrast in taxonomies used in particular cultures is a very important point in the cognitive approach to anthropological field work (as in [17] and [12], for example). The cognitive approach is clear in these papers: "Folk taxonomies are cultural phenomena.

Nevertheless, some agents may exist that are altruistic <ref> [10] </ref> enough to contribute to the anthropological work for pure "pleasure" (as happens sometimes in real life), so that it may reward a foreign agent to spend some of its efforts in looking explicitly for them.

Reference-contexts: In other words, we are considering here a sort of agent organisation that is far more complex than those focused on in [23]; they are more akin to the idea of organisations (groups of socially committed agents) in the sense of <ref> [11] </ref>, and accordingly this sort of agent restructuring is of a higher degree of complexity. The idea of artificial cultures (based on Cognitive Anthropology's view of culture discussed in section 2.3.5) refers to the organising principles of behaviour, perception and interaction of agents in each particular society. <p> current state of the art of MAS, describing the artificial culture of each society of agents would involve answering questions such as: Do these agents behave like consumers and producers in an economic market [31], or are their interactions based on the notion of power and beliefs about social dependencies <ref> [29, 11] </ref>? Do they use protocols as proposed in [8], do they use a language like the one in [14], or do they use KSE's ACL [19]?

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION We have been dealing with the problem of agent migration among different (mutually unfamiliar) societies, in the context of Multi-agent Systems (MAS). This problem was first presented in <ref> [13] </ref> and further discussed in [4] (see also [6]) and [22]. Our project regards basically the agent adaptation that takes place in such migrations. <p> Considering contrasting designers' preferences, it is quite likely that systems designed by different persons may come to have different features in communication language and social laws that govern the action of the agents in a society. In <ref> [13] </ref> it was already remarked that distinct open societies do not necessarily agree on language and protocols for communication and knowledge interchange. <p> Accordingly, agents cannot "be" (i.e., interact) in both societies at the same time, and this is the reason why we talk about agent migration. The rationale supporting the idea of migration is also very easy to understand by reference to the human analogue. As presented in <ref> [13] </ref>, an agent moves from one society to another either because the agents in the target society need the foreign agent's specific abilities in order to accomplish their current social goals or the foreign agent needs the help of agents in the target society for accomplishing its individual goals (given that

Reference-contexts: Therefore, considering all these observations we conclude that if a world-wide variety of culturally distinct MAS is to be regarded, which means a concern for interoperability <ref> [19] </ref>, it is not realistic to expect the existence of foolproof standard means that would allow an agent to interact in every different society, as intended with the Agent Communication Language (ACL) by researchers in the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort (KSE) [19] (we shall present this idea in detail in [5]). <p> to be regarded, which means a concern for interoperability <ref> [19] </ref>, it is not realistic to expect the existence of foolproof standard means that would allow an agent to interact in every different society, as intended with the Agent Communication Language (ACL) by researchers in the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort (KSE) [19] (we shall present this idea in detail in [5]).

These help to give a reasonable foundation to MAS as they concern the indissoluble social and situated character of cognitive phenomena. <p> We propose a specific approach to cultural anthropology, namely Cognitive Anthropology, as such a tool, despite the recent critiques of this approach, mainly concerning intracultural variation <ref> [24] </ref>. This section discusses some points of Cognitive Anthropology, starting from the perspective of [30].

Reference-contexts: Cricket, the national English team sport in summer, is played by teams of 11 agents. Informal games between villages, where a team from one village visits another, occasionally lead to difficulties for the visitors because not all of their 11 players arrive (e.g. see <ref> [27, chapter 7] </ref>). If a "team" therefore consists of 10 players, and it observes an able-bodied individual arriving as a spectator, this spectator may find himself strongly urged to join the team, which may already be taking part in a game.

Reference-contexts: This means that a group of agents may come to promote changes in their language, or their pre-defined ways of coordination, just as cultural changes occur with evolution in human societies (the problem of agents changing their communication protocols was already foreseen in <ref> [28] </ref>). Also, it is plausible that each society has its own way of perceiving and organising material phenomena in its own environment (see the discussion on Artificial Cultures, section 2.1).

Reference-contexts: TOWARDS ANTHROPOLOGICALLY-BASED ADAPTATION 2.1. BASIC IDEAS It is important to stress one more point in what is new concerning the idea of "migration" of agents.

Do they use protocols as proposed in [8], do they use a language like the one in [14], or do they use KSE's ACL [19]? Are these agents "believable" [1] so emotion is something to be taken into account? 1 How are material phenomena from the environment logically organised

Reference-contexts: We propose a specific approach to cultural anthropology, namely Cognitive Anthropology, as such a tool, despite the recent critiques of this approach, mainly concerning intracultural variation [24]. This section discusses some points of Cognitive Anthropology, starting from the perspective of <ref> [30] </ref>. Cognitive Anthropology originated as a change in the theoretical orientation of building a general theory of culture. <p> The aim was to use fairly formal methods to describe particular cultures, with each description being a theory for the culture it describes, "for it represents the conceptual model of organization used by its members" <ref> [30] </ref>. Describing a culture means answering questions such as: "How would the people of some other culture expect me to behave if I were a member of their culture; and what are the rules of appropriate behaviour in their culture?" [30], which are basically the questions an immigrant agent faces. <p> represents the conceptual model of organization used by its members" <ref> [30] </ref>. Describing a culture means answering questions such as: "How would the people of some other culture expect me to behave if I were a member of their culture; and what are the rules of appropriate behaviour in their culture?" [30], which are basically the questions an immigrant agent faces. The aspect of generating formal descriptions is one point that makes this approach to cultural anthropology particularly relevant to the computational counterpart problem of understanding societies' particularities, even if social scientists can criticise its relative lack of "humanistic" factors. <p> It is assumed that each people has a unique system for perceiving and organizing material phenomena | things, events, behaviour, and emotions." <ref> [30] </ref>. That is, the interest is not about the material phenomena per se, but on their relevance and on their cognitive organisation in the human mind, which are both culture-dependent. Examples of field work projects using this approach can be found, for example, in [17] and [12]. 2.3. <p> This is seen as a window into the mental processes of other peoples. Cognitive anthropologists study "how other people `name' the `things' in the environment and how these things are organized into larger groupings." <ref> [30] </ref>. Their task is to realise how other people organise what seems chaotic, for everything in that environment is in principle unknown to the anthropologists. <p> What is significant in the environment and how perception is organised are studied through the way natives label things: "Naming is seen as one of the chief methods for imposing order on perceptions." <ref> [30] </ref>. A culture is regarded as consisting of many semantic domains (i.e., subjects) organised through semantic features (also called components or features of meaning), which are the dimensions considered important or distinctive by natives. <p> Paradigms, which have two major features that intersect one another (presented in the form of a table). Trees, which are ordered by sequential contrast on only one feature at a time; they are based on successive choices among two or more alternatives. Tyler <ref> [30] </ref> gives further details. Different cultures never share the same semantic domains and features of meaning, and they do not organise the features in the same way: "The problem for the anthropologist is to discover the semantic domains and their features... <p> He must attempt to discover the semantic world in which these people live." <ref> [30] </ref>. All these structures are rather familiar in computer science: as in anthropology, specialists in knowledge-based computing systems are concerned with elucidating how an intelligence perceives the world, so the correspondence of their tools of description is no surprise.
