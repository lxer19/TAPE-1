Abstract: In this paper, a face localization system is proposed in which local detectors are coupled with a statistical model of the spatial arrangement of facial features to yield robust performance. The outputs from the local detectors are treated as candidate locations and constellations are formed from these. The effects of translation, rotation, and scale are eliminated by mapping to a set of shape variables. The constellations are then ranked according to the likelihood that the shape variables correspond to a face versus an alternative model. Incomplete constellations, which occur when some of the true features are missed, are handled in a principled way.

Reference-contexts: For any of these recognition algorithms to work in real-world applications, a system is needed that can reliably locate faces in cluttered scenes and with occlusions. Recent studies have begun to address the problem of face localization.

A key result that we use was obtained by Dryden and Mardia <ref> [6] </ref> who derived the exact density of the shape variables for the case when the original figure space variables obey a multivariate Gaussian distribution. 2 Local Feature Detectors The initial step in our face localization algorithm is to identify candidate locations for various facial features using simple detectors. <p> Essentially, one dimension is dropped for factoring out scale, one for rotation, and two for translation. Kendall [13] denotes this new shape space as N 2 and shows that it can be identified with a version of the complex projective space CP N2 . Dryden and Mardia <ref> [6] </ref> have found the joint probability density junction over the shape variables under the assumption that the original feature points are positioned in the plane according to a general 2N -dimensional Gaussian distribution. This is the fundamental result from shape statistics that we exploit in our face localization system. <p> 2 + y i y 2 ) = x 2 + y 2 v i = (y i x 2 x i y 2 ) = x 2 + y 2 (7) The joint probability density function (pdf) of U is given in the following theorem: Theorem 1 (Shape Density <ref> [6] </ref>) Under the mul-tivariate Gaussian model for the figure-space coordi nates (Equation 1), the joint probability density func tion of the shape vector U is p U (U) = (2) r jj 2 N2 where q = i=0 1 2 ( 1 i fr 1 gL 2 ) 2 g = <p> The estimated fl i 's were reduced by an additional factor ff = 0:9 to allow for feature occlusion. The shape parameters were also determined from the training database. In <ref> [6] </ref>, Dryden and Mardia recommended using the set of observed shape vectors in a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the parameters of the shape distribution; however, they acknowledged that the "estimation can be problematic for completely general covariance structures." We implemented the ML procedure and also encountered difficulties.
