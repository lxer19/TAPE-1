Abstract: In this paper, we present several necessary and sufficient conditions for strictly nonblocking of three-stage multirate multicast Clos networks under various assumptions on the fan-out property of the switches. These conditions generalize the results of Giacomazzi and Trecordi that were strictly nonblocking three-stage Clos networks for circuit switching multicast. In addition, two previous results in the literature will be corrected.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION A three-stage Clos network <ref> [1] </ref> has been extensively utilized for telecommunications and parallel computing systems to provide connectivities between two parties [2]. <p> A network is rearrangeable if it is wide-sense nonblocking. It is well known that C (n 1 ; r 1 ; m; n 2 ; r 2 ) is strictly nonblocking if and only if m n 1 + n 2 1 in a CS environment <ref> [1] </ref>. In a symmetric C (n; m; r), the network is strictly nonblocking iff m 2n1.

Reference-contexts: We will also derive conditions for the network to be CS strictly nonblocking and compare with the previous results by Giacomazzi and Trecordi <ref> [5] </ref>. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives preliminaries including the network description and the short review of related work. In Section 3, we present the main theorems regarding strictly nonblock-ing for multirate multicast communications. <p> Gi-acomazzi and Trecordi <ref> [5] </ref> recently gave a necessary and sufficient condition for C (n 1 ; r 1 ; m; n 2 ; r 2 ) to be strictly nonblocking in consideration that the fan-out in the output stage is not automatic. <p> the following condition under assumption of N 2 n 1 d: m = minfN 2 ; (n 1 + n 2 )dg: Corollary 7 (Giacomazzi and Trecordi) When f 1 = 1 and f 2 = N 2 , (7) reduces to m = N 2 . 4 CONCLUSION In <ref> [5] </ref>, the necessary and sufficient conditions for C (n 1 ; r 1 ; m; n 2 ; r 2 ) to be strictly nonblocking for circuit switching were given by considering the minimum number of connections addressing at least one of output switches engaged by a new incoming connection so

Reference-contexts: In a symmetric C (n; m; r), the network is strictly nonblocking iff m 2n1. Masson and Jor-dan <ref> [6] </ref> showed that C (n; m; r) is strictly nonblocking for multicast connection requests when m rn + n 1 under condition that the fan-out property of the output stage switches is assumed to be automatic. <p> On the assumption that the fan-out capabilities are limited to the input and output switches, Hwang [8] derived a necessary and sufficient condition for C (n 1 ; r 1 ; m; n 2 ; r 2 ) to be rearrangeable by extending the results of Masson and Jordan <ref> [6] </ref>. In the event that all switches have the fan-out ability, Yang and Masson [9] gave the best known sufficient condition for C (n 1 ; r 1 ; m; n 2 ; r 2 ) to be wide-sense nonblocking.

Feld-man et al <ref> [7] </ref> showed that the number of crosspoints required in a strictly nonblocking three-stage Clos network is greater than a large rectangular crossbar of equal size if f 1 = 1; f 2 = N 2 under the assumption of the automatic fan-out in the output stage.
