Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to give an exposition of material dealing with constructive logic, typed -calculi, and linear logic. The emergence in the past ten years of a coherent field of research often named "logic and computation" has had two major (and related) effects: firstly, it has rocked vigorously the world of mathematical logic; secondly, it has created a new computer science discipline, which spans from what is traditionally called theory of computation, to programming language design. Remarkably, this new body of work relies heavily on some "old" concepts found in mathematical logic, like natural deduction, sequent calculus, and -calculus (but often viewed in a different light), and also on some newer concepts. Thus, it may be quite a challenge to become initiated to this new body of work (but the situation is improving, there are now some excellent texts on this subject matter). This paper attempts to provide a coherent and hopefully "gentle" initiation to this new body of work. We have attempted to cover the basic material on natural deduction, sequent calculus, and typed -calculus, but also to provide an introduction to Girard's linear logic, one of the most exciting developments in logic these past six years. The first part of these notes gives an exposition of background material (with some exceptions, such as "contraction-free" systems for intuitionistic propositional logic and the Girard-translation of classical logic into intuitionistic logic, which is new). The second part is devoted to more current topics such as linear logic, proof nets, the geometry of interaction, and unified systems of logic (LU ). fl This research was partially supported by ONR Grant NOOO14-88-K-0593.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the contraction rule plays a crucial role in linear logic, and in the understanding of the correspondence between proofs and computations, in particular strict versus lazy evaluation (see Abramsky <ref> [1] </ref>). In order to obtain a system for intuitionistic logic, we restrict the righthand side of a sequent to consist of at most one formula. We also modify the (oe: left) rule and the (_: right) rule which splits into two rules. <p> In fact, it is possible to specify reduction rules imposing certain strategies, for example, eager or lazy evaluation. Such reduction strategies have been considered in a similar setting for linear logic by Abramsky <ref> [1] </ref>. The above proof-term assignment has the property that if . M : A is derivable and , then . M : A is also derivable. This is because the axioms are of the form ; x: A . x: A. <p> With the old rules, the reduction is generally eager since both M and N will have to be normalized, unless x or y do not appear in P . Such aspects of lazy or eager evaluation become even more obvious in linear logic, as stressed by Abramsky <ref> [1] </ref>. We now consider some equivalent Gentzen systems. 51 11 The Gentzen Systems LJ and LK Axioms of the form A; ; A are very convenient for searching for proofs backwards, but for logical purity, it may be desirable to consider axioms of the form A A.

Reference-contexts: Equivalently, conversion in !;fi;+;? is Church-Rosser.

Reference-contexts: Such systems were discovered in the early fifties by Vorob'ev [35, 36]. Interest in such systems has been revived recently due to some work in automated theorem proving by Dyckhoff <ref> [5] </ref>, on the embedding of intuitionistic logic into linear logic (without using the exponentials) by Lincoln, Scedrov and Shankar [20], and on the complexity of cut-elimination by Hudelmaier [17]. In order to simplify the discussion, we first consider propositional intuitionistic logic based on the connective oe. <p> The new system LJ T oe (which is a subsystem of Dyckhoff's system <ref> [5] </ref>), is the following: P; P P; P oe B; C (oe: left) B oe C; A oe B C; D (oe: left ) A; B (oe: right ) where P is atomic. <p> As we said earlier, the equivalence of the new system LJ T oe with the previous system GK oe i is a bit challenging. A nice proof is given in Dyckhoff <ref> [5] </ref>. As an interesting application of the system LJ T oe , we observe that the sequent (((P oe Q) oe P ) oe P ) oe Q Q is provable. However, this sequent is not provable in G oe i without using a contraction. <p> On the other hand, ILL fl is the right system for the translation into linear logic. Actually, it is possible to formulate a contraction-free system LJ T oe;^;_;? for the whole of intuitionistic propositional logic. Such a system given in Dyckhoff <ref> [5] </ref> is shown below. 45 Definition 9.1 The axioms and inference rules of the system LJ T oe;^;_;? are given below. <p> The equivalence of LJ T oe;^;_;? and GK i is shown in Dyckhoff <ref> [5] </ref>. A nice feature of the system LJ T oe;^;_;? is that it yields easily the decidability of provability. <p> Failure to complete this model corresponds to provability. 4 In the propositional case, it is also possible to formulate a contraction-free system similar to the system LJ T oe;^;_;? . Such a system is given in Dyckhoff <ref> [5] </ref>. 10 A Proof-Term Calculus for G oe;^;_;8;9;?;cut Before we move on to the sequent calculi LK and LJ and a detailed proof of cut-elimination for these systems, it is worth describing a term calculus corresponding to the sequent calculus G i .

Reference-contexts: Thus, the systems G oe;^;_;8;9;? c and c are equivalent. Note in passing that a semantic proof can also be given. Indeed, it is possible to show that GK oe;^;_;8;9;? c is complete (see Gallier <ref> [6] </ref>). Also, as suggested by Peter Baumann, it is possible to prove directly that every proof in G oe;^;_;8;9;? c can be converted to a proof in GK oe;^;_;8;9;? c . <p> Systems of invertible rules for classical logic are used systematically in Gallier <ref> [6] </ref> (see section 3.4 and 5.4). In our opinion, such systems are best suited for presenting completeness proofs in the most transparent fashion.

Reference-contexts: A proof can be given by adapting Tait's reducibility method [28], [30], as done in Girard [10] (1971), [11] (1972) (see also Gallier <ref> [7] </ref>). <p> A further generalization would be to allow higher-order quantification as in Girard's system F !

If one looks carefully at the structure of proofs, one realizes that it is not unreasonable to declare other proofs as being redundant, and thus to add some additional reduction rules. For example, the proof term h 1 (M ); 2 (M )i can be identified with M itself.

Reference-contexts: It is an extremely interesting and deep fact that the system G oe;^;_;?;cut i and the system G oe;^;_;? i are indeed equivalent. This fundamental result known as the cut elimination theorem was first proved by Gentzen in 1935 <ref> [8] </ref>. The proof actually gives an algorithm for converting a proof with cuts into a cut-free proof. The main difficulty is to prove that this algorithm terminates. Gentzen used a fairly complex induction measure which was later simplified by Tait [29]. <p> This leads us to the systems LJ and LK defined and studied by Gentzen <ref> [8] </ref> (except that Gentzen also had an explicit exchange rule, but we assume that we are dealing with multisets). Definition 11.2 The axioms and inference rules of the system LJ for intuitionistic first-order logic are given below. <p> LJ ) and G oe;^;_;8;9;:;cut c (resp. G i ) are equivalent using contraction and weakening. 54 12 Cut Elimination in LK (and LJ ) The cut elimination theorem also applies to LK and LJ . Historically, this is the version of the cut elimination theorem proved by Gentzen <ref> [8] </ref> (1935). Gentzen's proof was later simplified by Tait [29] and Girard [13] (especially the induction measure). A simplified version of Tait's proof is nicely presented by Schwichtenberg [26]. The proof given here combines ideas from Tait and Girard.

Reference-contexts: Actually, in order to salvage some form of subformula property ruined by the introduction of the connectives _, 9, and ?, one can add further conversions known as "commuting conversions" (or "permutative conversions"). A lucid discussion of the necessity for such rules can be found in Girard <ref> [9] </ref>. Theorem 7.4 and theorem 7.5 can be extended to cover the reduction rules of definition 7.3 together with the new reductions rules, but at the cost of rather tedious and rather noninstructive technical complications. <p> Due to the lack of space, we will not elaborate any further on this subject and simply refer the interested reader to Prawitz [23], Girard [11], or Girard <ref> [9] </ref> for details. A sequent-calculus formulation for intuitionistic first-order logic is given in the next definition. 31 Definition 7.6 The axioms and inference rules of the system G oe;^;_;8;9;?;cut i for intuitionistic first order logic are given below. <p> A simplified version of Tait's proof is nicely presented by Schwichtenberg [26]. The proof given here combines ideas from Tait and Girard. The induction measure used is due to Tait [29] (the cut-rank), but the explicit transformations are adapted from Girard [13], <ref> [9] </ref>. We need to define the cut-rank of a formula, the depth of a proof, and the logical depth of a proof. Definition 12.1 The degree jAj of a formula A is the number of logical connectives in A. Let be an LK-proof.

With our system, it is possible to write reduction rules that correspond to cut-elimination steps (see section 12).

Reference-contexts: Note that the assumptions x: A occurring in the leaves of the form 0 ; ; x: A; y: C C were never used anyway. This illustrates the fact that not all assumptions are necessarily used. This will not be the case in linear logic <ref> [12] </ref>. Also, the same assumption may be used more than once, as we can see in the (oe-elim) rule. Again, this will not be the case in linear logic, where every assumption is used exactly once, unless specified otherwise by an explicit mechanism. <p> This suggests, and this path was followed by Girard, to split the connectives ^ and _ into two versions: the multiplicative version of ^ and _, denoted as and -, and the additive version of ^ and _, denoted as & and . In linear logic, due to Girard <ref> [12] </ref>, the connectives ^ and _ are split into multiplicative and additive versions, contraction and weakening are dropped, negation denoted A ? is involutive, and in order to regain the loss of expressiveness due to the absence of contraction and weakening, some new connectives (the exponentials ! and ?) are introduced.

Reference-contexts: It is trivial that the converse of Theorem 13.12 holds. We shall now discuss another translation of classical logic into intuitionistic logic due to Gi rard <ref> [14] </ref>. Girard has pointed out that the usual double-negation translations have some rather undesirable properties: (1) They are not compatible with substitution. <p> Girard has discovered a translation which does not suffer from these defects, and this translation also turns out to be quite economical in the number of negation signs introduced <ref> [14] </ref>. The main idea is to assign a sign or polarity (+ or ) to every formula. <p> Given = B 1 ; : : : ; B n , we let = B 1 ; : : : ; B n . Then, a sequent is translated into the sequent ; . We have the following theorem due du Girard <ref> [14] </ref>.

Lemma 13.15 The translation A 7! b A given in Definition 13.13 is compatible with substitutions respecting polarities. Furthermore, it satisfies a number of remarkable identities (in the equivalences below, it is assumed that we are considering the Girard-translations of the formulae involved. <p> Proof. The proof is quite straightforward, but somewhat tedious. Because of the polarities, many cases have to be considered. Some cases are checked in Girard <ref> [14] </ref>, and the others can be easily verified. Acknowledgement.

Reference-contexts: Such a system due to Kleene <ref> [18] </ref> has no contraction rule, and the premise of every sequent can be interpreted as a set as opposed to a multiset (furthermore, in the case of intuitionistic propositional logic, it is possible to design contraction-free systems which yield easily the decidability of provability, see section 9 for details). 5 Definition <p> The above system is inspired from Kleene <ref> [18] </ref> (see system G3, page 481). Note that contraction steps have been incorporated in the (8: left)-rule and the (9: right)-rule. <p> Accordingly, from now on, we will also assume that G oe;^;_;8;9;? c has been formulated using the axioms ?; ; A rather than the rule (?: right ). The equivalence of the systems G oe;^;_;8;9;? c and GK oe;^;_;8;9;? c is shown using two lemmas inspired from Kleene <ref> [18] </ref> (1952). First, it is quite easy to see that every proof in GK oe;^;_;8;9;? c can be converted to a proof in G oe;^;_;8;9;? c . For the converse, we warn the reader that some of the lemmas given in an earlier version were incorrect. <p> We now present a cut-free system for intuitionistic logic which does not include any explicit contraction rules and in which the premise of every sequent can be interpreted as a set. Using this system GK i due to Kleene (see system G3a, page 481, in <ref> [18] </ref>), we can give a very nice proof of the decidability of provability in intuitionistic propositional logic. The idea behind this system is to systematically keep a copy of the principal formula in the premise (s) of every left-rule. <p> Even though Lemma 13.1 fails in general, in particular for universal formulae, Kleene has made the remarkable observation that the culprit is precisely the (8: right)-rule <ref> [18] </ref> (see Theorem 59, page 492). Indeed, the lemma still holds for arbitrary sequents B 1 ; : : : ; B n , provided that their proofs in G oe;^;_;:;8;9 c do not use the rule (8: right).

Interest in such systems has been revived recently due to some work in automated theorem proving by Dyckhoff [5], on the embedding of intuitionistic logic into linear logic (without using the exponentials) by Lincoln, Scedrov and Shankar <ref> [20] </ref>, and on the complexity of cut-elimination by Hudelmaier [17]. In order to simplify the discussion, we first consider propositional intuitionistic logic based on the connective oe. <p> However, this proposition is nonother than Pierce's law, and we leave it to the reader to verify that it is not provable in the system LJ T oe . In showing that intuitionistic propositional logic can be embedded in linear logic (without using the exponentials), Lincoln, Scedrov and Shankar <ref> [20] </ref> use a system ILL fl almost identical to LJ T oe , except that instead of the rule P; B; C (oe: left ) they use the rule P B; C (oe: left ) with P atomic.

Reference-contexts: The proof actually gives an algorithm for converting a proof with cuts into a cut-free proof. The main difficulty is to prove that this algorithm terminates. Gentzen used a fairly complex induction measure which was later simplified by Tait <ref> [29] </ref>. The contraction rule plays a crucial role in the proof of this theorem, and it is therefore natural to believe that this rule cannot be dispensed with. <p> Historically, this is the version of the cut elimination theorem proved by Gentzen [8] (1935). Gentzen's proof was later simplified by Tait <ref> [29] </ref> and Girard [13] (especially the induction measure). A simplified version of Tait's proof is nicely presented by Schwichtenberg [26].

Reference-contexts: In fact, proof search should be conducted in the system GK oe;^;_;8;9;? i , since we know that searching for an irredundant proof terminates in the propositional case (see theorem 8.10). Takeuti <ref> [31] </ref> has made an interesting observation about invertibility of rules in intuitionistic cut-free sequent calculi, but before discussing this observation, we shall discuss other contraction-free systems for intuitionistic propositional logic for which decidability of provability is immediate. Such systems were discovered in the early fifties by Vorob'ev [35, 36]. <p> An in-depth study of invertibility and admissibility of rules in intuitionistic logic can be found in Paul Roziere's elegant thesis [25]. We now come back to Takeuti's observation <ref> [31] </ref> (see Chapter 1, paragraph 8). <p> The idea behind the design of the term calculus of this section arose from inspiring conversations with Val Breazu-Tannen, whoom I gladly thank.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, the reason is that the reduction relation induced by cut-elimination transformations is finer than fi-reduction (as alluded to in section 10). Thus, the exact relationship between cut-elimination and (strong) normalization remains a challenging open problem. For the latest results, see Ungar <ref> [33] </ref>. A few more remarks about the role of contraction and weakening will be useful as a motivation for linear logic.

Reference-contexts: This is regrettable, but a cynic would not be surprised: there is no free lunch!

Although Zucker obtains some very nice results in 68 this formidable paper, he does not provide a complete answer to the problem.
