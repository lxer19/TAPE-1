Abstract: In the near future GPS will be widely used, thus allowing a broad variety of location dependent services such as direction giving, navigation, etc. In this document we propose a family of protocols and addressing methods to integrate GPS into the Internet Protocol to enable the creation of location dependent services. The solutions which we present are flexible (scalable) in terms of the target accuracy of the GPS. The main challenge is to integrate the concept of physical location into the current design of the Internet which relies on logical addressing. Two solutions are presented in this draft and a third solution is sketched.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, for the client initiated mode, the client requests will only go to the "near by" servers which again will join only C addresses for the "near by" clients. This schemes generalize the earlier anycast, narrowcast and nearcast proposals (see <ref> [1] </ref> for references) to the situation when the GPS cards are used. The presence of GPS card is necessary both for the clients as well as servers in order for them to determine the current S and C addresses to join.

Reference-contexts: Because of PIM-SM's internetwork-friendly characteristics and its presumed eventual adoption by the multicast community, it would be a good platform on which to build GPS-Multicast. The PIM-SM protocol is similar to Core-Based Multicast Trees <ref> [2] </ref> in that it uses a Rendezvous Point (RP) to arrange for the senders and receivers of a multicast group to meet. This RP then also becomes the root of a sparse multicast tree with the multicast group members being the leaves of the tree.

Reference-contexts: Some attempts have been made to decentralize the database through the use of UUCP-Zones Later, two separate groups [13] <ref> [3] </ref>, tried similar approaches based on the Domain Name System [18]. This system improved on the UUMAP project by decentralizing the geographic location information, thus relieving the burden of the system administrators and helping to ensure an up-to-date and correct database. <p> In both cases, the DNS data-structure which contains the host computer information, the RR records [19], were augmented with new fields to contain geographical location information in the form of longitude and latitude. However, in [13] and <ref> [3] </ref>, the DNS system can only return a geographic location given an IP address. In this paper we strive to perform the reverse function, that is to return IP addresses given a geographical location.

Reference-contexts: The geographic position can be obtained by the receiver either from the GPS card or, indoors, from the indoor GeoNode which itself knows its geographic position as a part of its configuration file. 4.5 GeoHost The GeoHost daemon will monitor the ICMP Router Discovery <ref> [5] </ref> messages sent out by the GeoN-ode and keep the latest in a cache. It will then attempt to determine if the host computer's current location is contained in any of the destination polygons of the geographic messages.

Reference-contexts: Notice again, that this process takes place only once for a very long time since GPS multicast groups are expected to be very stable. Another possible solution to further limit the multicast address propagation is based on PIM <ref> [7] </ref> and is sketched at the end of this section. 5.4.1 GPS Routing Given a packet we always look for the "closest" match in the routing table. If there is a complete match we follow such a link. <p> With IPv6 we will have, of course, much more addressing space which we can use for the GPS multicast routing. 5.4.4 PIM solution The receiver-driven Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) <ref> [7] </ref> [8] [9] comes in two flavors: Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and Dense Mode (PIM-DM). PIM-DM is essentially the same data-driven model currently in use now except with a little extra PIM overhead.

Reference-contexts: The recent redesign of the Internet Protocol (IP) <ref> [10] </ref> and the advent of the Global Positioning System [25] [26] [27] gave a new stimulus for this work. The first serious attempt to relate IP-addresses to geographical locations was the UUMAP project [24] in 1985. <p> Simulation studies were performed that showed that Cartesian Routing performed only marginally worse than regular IP routing in terms of hop counts. Our work attempts to provide the more general multi-point-to-multi-point geographic routing. In the proposed redesign of the IP protocol <ref> [10] </ref>, IP Address Type Space was specifically allocated for geographic addresses [11] [23]. These unicast geographic addresses would be modeled on the Bell Telephone System's area codes and location prefixes.

Reference-contexts: The first attempt to design a system that actually routes packets according to their geographic destination and the work that is closest to ours is Cartesian Routing by Gregory G. Finn <ref> [14] </ref>. Cartesian Routing was an attempt to alleviate foreseeable future routing and addressing problems in large and dense metropolitan internetworks. The proposed solution called for point-to-point routing based on the geographic location of the source, the intermediate routers, and the destination.

Reference-contexts: First the router must determine if it services any part of the area of the destination polygon. To do this, the router determines if the destination polygon and the router's service area polygon intersect 1 <ref> [21] </ref> or contain each other. If not, then the router simply sends the message to its parent router. However, if the result is not null, then the router does service the area described by the intersection polygon.
