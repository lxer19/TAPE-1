Abstract: The construction of elementary unitary matrices that transform a complex vector to a multiple of e 1 , the first column of the identity matrix, are studied. We present four variants and their software implementation, including a discussion on the LAPACK subroutine CLARFG. Comparisons are also given.

In fact, our attempt to understand the differences between the Wilkinson approach and the alternate formulation implemented by LAPACK led to this study.

Unlike the previous two versions, this one computes an elementary unitary matrix U so that U H x is a real multiple of e 1 . As explained at the beginning of x 2, the resulting oe cannot be real unless 1 is also.
