Abstract: Due to advances in wireless communication technology there is a growing demand for providing continuous network access to the users of portable computers, regardless of their location. Existing network protocols cannot meet this requirement since they were designed with the assumption of a static network topology where hosts do not change their location over time. We have developed a model which fits naturally into the usual framework for routing over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Then, based on IP's Loose Source Route option, we have developed a scheme for implementing agents conforming to this model and providing transparent network access to mobile hosts. Our scheme is easy to implement, requires no changes to the existing set of hosts and routers, and achieves optimal routing in many cases. An outline of the proposed scheme is presented and a reference implementation is described.

Reference-contexts: A source can specify a list of routers which are to be visited in the specified sequence before the datagram is delivered to the final destination. According to the host requirements document <ref> [1] </ref>, return traffic to the originator of the loose source routed packet is also sent with the LSR option by reversing the route taken by the incoming packets. We use this technique to achieve optimal routing between an MH and a CH.

Reference-contexts: An existing LSR option in an outgoing packet has already been extended by the MR to include the local MAS as a required intermediate router for the source route. This model of operation conforms to the description given in Comer <ref> [2] </ref>. However, since in most current implementations all routing is done on the basis of the destination address, the actual operation is somewhat different (see Figures 7 and 8). The only routine which needs modification is ip output ().

In contrast, our approach, which is based on the use of a natural model and an existing IP option, does not introduce any new protocol and achieves optimal routing. <p> To provide application transparency it is desirable to devise a method by which hosts retain their home addresses and continue to receive packets despite their migration from one network to another.

For this reason, many routers disable this. Note that encapsulation has exactly same problem unless each MSR <ref> [3] </ref> knows every other MSR. Although this is a genuine problem, we should not overlook the benefits of source routing only on the basis of this limitation. IP itself has a lot of security holes. Besides, mobile networks, due to wireless links, are quite prone to security attacks.

Reference-contexts: However, the risk of fragmentation is higher in an encapsulation based approach because the size of an encapsulated packet is larger than a packet with LSR option. The LSR approach also has shortcomings. The first problem is that UDP <ref> [5] </ref> agents do not perform route reversal. As a result, UDP packets originating from a stationary host are always routed sub-optimally via a mobile router. LSR route reversal is actually specified to occur in layers above IP, so that it is improper for IP to do the route reversal itself.

Reference-contexts: Since MAS keeps a list of all MHs residing in its cell, it can forward those packets to the destination MH. If the wireless link layer technology supports direct MH to MH communication then the MAS can also send an ICMP <ref> [6] </ref> redirect message to the source MH so that it can directly communicate to the destination MH rather than source routing its traffic through the MAS. 4.4 Mobile Host to Mobile Host in different cells An MH does not inspect the destination IP address to determine whether the destination host is

Another proposal to support mobile hosts is from Matsushita <ref> [11] </ref>. This method is also based on the encapsulation approach. A mobile host is assigned a temporary address when it visits a new network. The packets destined to the home address of the mobile host are intercepted by a Packet Forwarding Server (PFS).
