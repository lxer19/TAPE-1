Abstract: As widely argued [4, 5], transitive roles play an important role in the adequate representation of aggregated objects: they allow these objects to be described by referring to their parts without specifying a level of decomposition. In [4], the Description Logic (DL) ALCH R + is presented, which extends ALC with transitive roles and a role hierarchy. It is argued in [6] that ALCH R + is well-suited to the representation of aggregated objects in applications that require various part-whole relations to be distinguished, some of which are transitive. However, ALCH R + allows neither the description of parts by means of the whole to which they belong, or vice versa. To overcome this limitation, we present the DL ALCHI R + which allows the use of, for example, has part as well as is part of. To achieve this, ALCH R + was extended with inverse roles. It could be argued that, instead of defining yet another DL, one could make use of the results presented in [1] and use ALC extended with role expressions which include transitive closure and inverse operators. The reason for not proceeding like this is the fact that transitive roles can be implemented more efficiently than the transitive closure of roles (see [4]), although they lead to the same complexity class (EXPTIME-hard) when added, together with role hierarchies, to ALC. Furthermore, it is still an open question whether the transitive closure of roles together with inverse roles necessitates the use of the cut rule [2], and this rule leads to an algorithm with very bad behaviour. We will present an algorithm for ALCHI R + without such a rule. 1 ALCHI R + is the DL obtained by augmenting the well-known DL ALC [7] with transitively closed roles, inverse (converse) roles, and arbitrary role hierarchies. We assume that the role hierarchy is given as a partial ordering v on the set of role names.

Reference-contexts: Functional roles are useful, not only for the representation of aggregated objects, but also in general because they provide a weak form of number restrictions; including inverse roles in the role hierarchy is necessary in order to internalise general inclusion axioms <ref> [4] </ref>. Finally, the extended algorithm will be implemented in a descendant of FaCT [3] so that it can be tested in realistic applications.
