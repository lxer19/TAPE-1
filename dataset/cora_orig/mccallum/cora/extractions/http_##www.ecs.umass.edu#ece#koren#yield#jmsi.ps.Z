Abstract: In this paper we study two important reliability issues in deep submicron VLSI design, namely antenna effect and crosstalk noise, in the context of three-layer channel routing. Cost functions for both of the failure mechanisms are introduced and based on these cost models, reliability enhancement techniques are presented. For antenna effect minimization, a layer reassignment algorithm is adopted while for crosstalk minimization, an algorithm that combines layer reassignment and track reassignment is presented. Experimental results show that these algorithms can reduce the antenna effect and the crosstalk noise considerably without increasing the routing area. The relationship between these two objectives has also been studied and a technique for optimizing them simul taneously is proposed.

Reference-contexts: Unlike antenna effect, where damage is done during the manufacturing process, crosstalk noise is caused by coupling capacitance between long adjacent nets when the circuit operates at a high frequency. Increased coupling noise can cause signal delays, logic hazards and even malfunctioning of circuits <ref> [1, 13] </ref>, and thus controlling the level of crosstalk noise in a chip has become an important task for IC designers. In this paper we study the problem of antenna effect minimization and crosstalk minimization in 3-layer HVH channel routing.

Reference-contexts: Plasma etchers or ion implanters can induce a voltage into isolated leads, overstressing thin gate oxides. The leads (polysilicon or metal) act like antennas collecting charges and the accumulated charges may result in oxide breakdown. These charges may also have a negative effect on the hot-carrier device aging lifetime <ref> [4] </ref>. As devices are further scaled, the oxides are getting thinner and, as a result, the problem of antenna effect is expected to worsen.

The information about each benchmark, such as number of nets, number of tracks and number of columns in the channel is shown in Table 1. <p> The percentage improvements for the max-imum and total crosstalk are shown in column 5 and column 7, respectively. In our examples, all the original HVH 3-layer routing layouts were obtained by using the router reported in <ref> [7] </ref>. As mentioned before we use the overlap length between adjacent wires to represent the crosstalk between them. From Table 4 we can see that an average of 16.4% reduction in maximum crosstalk can be achieved by our algorithm. <p> Parts of this paper were presented in the 1996 and 1997 IEEE Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems [5, 6].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Due to the scaling down of device geometry in deep-submicron technologies, antenna effect and crosstalk noise have become major concerns in high performance VLSI 1 circuit design. The antenna problem is a side effect of various plasma-based manu-facturing processes such as etching, etc <ref> [9, 14, 15, 16] </ref>. These plasma-based processes are widely used to get the fine feature size of modern IC. Plasma etchers or ion implanters can induce a voltage into isolated leads, overstressing thin gate oxides. <p> the plasma-induced charging mechanism is not fully understood, it has been found that the charging appears to be a problem when some poly and/or metal wires, which are neither covered by a shielding layer of oxide nor connected to the substrate by previously formed p-n junctions, are exposed to plasma <ref> [9, 14, 15, 16] </ref>. It has also been found that stressing due to plasma etching can be modeled as a constant current stress with the stressing current being proportional to the peripheral length of the 3 metal or polysilicon pattern [14].

Reference-contexts: Experimental results show that this approach is promising and substantial reductions in antenna length can be achieved. For crosstalk minimization, though there are several reports on crosstalk minimization in 2-layer channel routing <ref> [10, 11] </ref>, only a very limited number of papers have been published on crosstalk minimization in 3-layer routing. In [18], Thakur et. al. formulated the layer reassignment problem in 3-layer VHV routing as a longest path problem. This formulation however, is invalid for HVH routing. <p> Among all these factors the coupling capacitance provides a first order estimation and it has been used to represent the crosstalk value in <ref> [10] </ref> and [11]. Since the coupling capacitance is determined by the overlap and the distance between these two wires, we use the overlapping length between two adjacent wires to represent the coupling capacitance between them. <p> The final layout should also 9 satisfy all the vertical and horizontal constraints and should not increase the channel height. Track permutation for crosstalk minimization in 2-layer routing has been proved to be NP-hard <ref> [10] </ref> and therefore, we need to resort to heuristics to solve our problem, which is a generalized version of the track permutation problem.

The cost function for the antenna effect is the maximum antenna length. Benchmark examples with different randomly assigned drivers and receivers have been run.

The only published research in the area of routing for antenna effect minimization is by Wang et al <ref> [20] </ref>. They proposed several techniques to minimize the antenna effect in 3-layer channel routing. One drawback of their approach is the penalty of channel height increase. For example, their router requires four more tracks in the Deutsch difficult example to minimize the antenna effect. <p> this is that ex5, as well as ex1, ex3b, and ex3c, has a very short antenna in its original layout due to the lack of doglegs, and therefore, the room for improvement is much smaller compared with ex3a, ex4b, D1 and Diff. 7 Since the 3-layer channel router used in <ref> [20] </ref> is unavailable, we could not use their router to generate antenna effect optimized routing solutions for the benchmark examples and compare them with those obtained by our layer reassignment technique. The only comparison we can do is to compare our result for the Deutsch difficult example with theirs. <p> Both results for the Deutsch difficult example are shown in Table 3. From Table 3 we can see that the two approaches achieve similar quality solutions for the Deutsch difficult example in terms of maximum antenna length and average antenna length. However, in <ref> [20] </ref> 14 tracks were used, while we use only 10 tracks. 3 Routing for Crosstalk Minimization 3.1 Crosstalk in a Channel Crosstalk noise between two adjacent nets is determined by a number of factors including the coupling capacitance between them, the driving capacity of the two nets, timing of the signals,
