Title: Dynamical Challenges  
Note: 3.1 Strengths of Dynamicism  
Date: Chapter 3  
Pubnum: 47  
Abstract: On the basis of the discussion of the preceding chapter, we can now examine dynamicism in its cognitive science context. Applying the analysis of models, metaphors, analogies and theories from chapter one to the current state of dynamicism, we are now able to determine its success as a scientific theory. After briefly outlining the most valuable contributions of dynamicism to the study of cognition, we will examine some of the more pressing difficulties with accepting the dynamicist insistence that dynamicism is a new paradigm for the study of mind. Subsequently, we will be able determine an appropriate place for dynamical systems theory in the context of existing cognitive theories. The most compelling characteristic of dynamicist models is their inherent ability to effectively model complex temporal behavior. It is unanimously agreed that the temporal features of natural cognizers must be adequately accounted for in a good cognitive model. Not only does dynamical systems theory address the temporal aspect of cognition, it makes this aspect the most important. The reasons for choosing to do this are obvious to the dynamicists: we exist in time; we act in time; and we cognize in time - real time. Therefore, the dynamical systems equations, which have been applied successfully in other fields to predict complex temporal behaviors, should be applied to the complex temporal behavior of cognitive agents. Whether or not we choose to subscribe to dynamicist commitment to a particular type of model, they convincingly argue that we cannot remove our models of cognition from time and still expect good models. Natural cognition indeed seems to be inherently dynamical in nature. Furthermore, a cognitive model must not only model a particular level of temporal behavior, but all ranges of temporal behavior, from the neurological milliseconds to the cognitive seconds and beyond (see sections 2.0 and 2.2.2). Both short term, and long term behaviors can be effectively captured by systems

Reference-contexts: A further criticism of this model can be directed at its predictive or correlative properties. Although the model accounts quite well for a number of observed properties, it does not correspond with the actual EEG patterns in the olfactory lobe <ref> (Barton, 1994, p. 10) </ref>. The consequences of this inaccuracy seem quite severe. <p> to their field ignore the differences between their field and the rigorous ones from which dynamical systems theory arose: One way that the distinction between fields is set aside is when authors use rigorous terminology from nonlinear dynamics to refer to psychological variables that are multidimensional and difficult to quantify <ref> (Barton, 1994, p. 12) </ref>. For example, some psychologists have equated the dynamical concept of chaos with overwhelming anxiety, others with creativity, and still others with destructiveness (Barton, 1994). <p> For example, some psychologists have equated the dynamical concept of chaos with overwhelming anxiety, others with creativity, and still others with destructiveness <ref> (Barton, 1994) </ref>. These applications of chaos are clearly more metaphorical than rigorous, and bear little resemblance to the definitions used in precise dynamical systems theory models. <p> There is no rigor added to their model simply because the chosen metaphor is mathematical. Barton duly notes that in the paper describing one such dynamical model of a Jungian hypothesis, Abraham et al. imply a level of measurement precision we don't have in clinical psychology <ref> (Barton, 1994, p. 12) </ref>. There is no explanation in these clinical psychological applications of dynamics systems theory to the phenomenology or intentionality of cognition. These models are simply metaphorical descriptions, they advance no new insights in clinical psychology. They do not reveal any details about what is being modeled. <p> discontinuity between model and reality is a common problem in investigating natural nonlinear systems: Not only are investigators rarely able to completely characterize all the variables that affect a complex system, but they must isolate a system well enough to cut through what Morrison (1991) called a sea of noise <ref> (Barton, 1994, p. 10) </ref>. When it is difficult to know the factors involved and to find the signal of interest in ambient noise, as is often the case, it is common practice for dynamicists to define lumped parameters.

Reference-contexts: If dynamicism is to be a nonempirical cognitive theory, it will encounter the same difficulties as folk psychology <ref> (Churchland, 1989) </ref> and cannot reasonably be considered in the same category as symbolicism and connectionism. However, this is clearly not the aim of dynamicists. Clearly, lack of empirical exemplars in such a relatively new approach is no reason to dismiss it.

Reference-contexts: Examples of strange attractors, chaos, catastrophe, etc. are all found in connectionist networks, and such concepts have been used to analyze these networks. Critiques of connectionism from dynamicists do not seem to present any sort of united front. Some dynamicists note the lack of realism in some networks <ref> (Globus, 1992) </ref>. Others reject connectionism not because of a failure in principle but because of a failure of spirit (Thelen and Smith, 1994, p.41). 24 Still others reject connectionism as being too committed to symbolicist ideas: ideas like representation (van Gelder and Port, in press, p. 27). <p> The complexity of real networks does not represent a qualitatively distinct functioning, rather just the end-goal of current connectionist models. Thus, claims consonant with: simplified silicon nets can be thought of as computing but biologically realistic nets are non computational <ref> (Globus, 1992, p. 300) </ref> are severely misleading. The chemical modulation of neurotransmitter synthesis, release, transport, etc. is simply a more complicated process, not a qualitatively different method of functioning. As Globus (1992) later admits, connectionist networks severely stretch the concept of computation in the direction of dynamical systems theory.

Reference-contexts: Even though dynamical concepts and theory are seductive, we may mistake translation for explanation <ref> (Robertson, Cohen et al., 1993, p. 119) </ref>. We cannot allow ourselves to accept new concepts which do not deepen our understanding of the system being modeled. <p> However, upon further investigation, the only conclusions that could be drawn were: We clearly know very little about the biological substrate of CM <ref> (Robertson, Cohen et al., 1993, p. 147) </ref>. In the end, there is no completed dynamicist model presented, though models which do not work are discounted. So, they have employed dynamicist models to constrain the solution, but not to provide new insights. <p> In their closing remarks, they note: We are therefore a long way from the goal of building a dynamical model of CM in which the state variables and parameters have a clear correspondence with psychobiological and environmental factors <ref> (Robertson, Cohen et al., 1993, p. 147) </ref>. In other words, a truly dynamicist model is still a future consideration.

Reference-contexts: This output was achieved by setting a number of feedback gains and distributed delays in accordance with our understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the larger system <ref> (Skarda and Freeman, 1987, p. 166) </ref> in the set of differential equations that had been chosen to model the olfactory bulb. It is important to note that the behavior of the system can be greatly affected by the choice of certain parameters, especially if the system is potentially chaotic. <p> Most tellingly, the authors themselves saw their paper and model as showing that the brain may indeed use computational mechanisms like those found in connectionist models <ref> (Skarda and Freeman, 1987, p. 161) </ref>. Furthermore, they realized that: Our model supports the line of research pursued by proponents of connectionist or parallel distributed processing (PDP) models in cognitive science (Skarda and Freeman, 1987, p. 170). Dynamicists, however, wish to rest a new cognitive paradigm on such a model. <p> Furthermore, they realized that: Our model supports the line of research pursued by proponents of connectionist or parallel distributed processing (PDP) models in cognitive science <ref> (Skarda and Freeman, 1987, p. 170) </ref>.

Ironically, the model itself looks very much like a connectionist network, with the less typical addition of inhibition and far more complex transfer functions at each node. <p> most rigorous of dynamical models, such as the Skarda and Freeman model previously discussed, extending dynamical concepts beyond the metaphorical proves difficult: Given this broad picture of the dynamics of this neural system we can sketch a metaphorical picture of its multiple stable states in terms of a phase portrait <ref> (Skarda and Freeman, 1987, p. 166) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One of the best known refutations of this position was given by Chomsky in his 1959 review of B. F. Skinner's book Verbal Behavior. Subsequently, behaviorism fell out of favor as it was further shown that the behaviorist approach was inadequate for explicating even basic animal learning <ref> (Thagard, 1992, p. 231) </ref>. The reasons for the behaviorist failure was its fundamental rejection of representation in natural cognizers. Dynamicists have forwarded a similar rejection of representation as important to cognition (see sections 2.1.3, 2.2.5, 2.3.5). Consequently, they fall prey to the same criticism forwarded over three decades ago. <p> Consequently, they fall prey to the same criticism forwarded over three decades ago. The early work of researchers like Johnson-Laird, Miller, Simon and Newell firmly established a general commitment to representation in cognitive science inquiries <ref> (Thagard, 1992, p. 233) </ref>. There have been no reasons given by dynamicists which would fundamentally disturb this commitment. Finally, it seems quite clear that the average human cognizer is continually manipulating representations.

Reference-contexts: Dynamicists propose to explain all of cognition - a cognitive theory cannot claim to be more unified. Though dynamicists to date have often limited the scope of their models to locomotor issues, their objective is unequivocally to explain all aspects of cognition <ref> (Thelen and Smith, 1994) </ref>. Clearly, the dynamical systems approach to cognition is intended as a unified theory, one which is expected to rival the existing connectionist and symbolicist theories of cognitive science (van Gelder and Port, in press). <p> Dynamicists tend to be quite succinct in presenting their opinion of what this relation should be and are not shy about their project to replace current cognitive approaches: we propose here a radical departure from current cognitive theory. <ref> (Thelen and Smith, 1994, p. xix) </ref>. The dynamicist wish to dissolve connectionism and symbolicism has given them reason to critically assess the theoretical commitments of both paradigms. A detailed comparison of the three accounts has been provided in chapter 2. <p> Critiques of connectionism from dynamicists do not seem to present any sort of united front. Some dynamicists note the lack of realism in some networks (Globus, 1992).

The lack of realism in networks is often intentional due to the limitations of current computational power.
