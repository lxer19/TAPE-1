Abstract: The goal of design rationale capture (DRC) is improving design quality and reducing design time. The premise of DRC is that keeping records of previous design decisions in an organized manner can help in doing various critical design activities such as communicating design decisions and redesign. In this paper we describe an on-going work to design a DRC system integrated with a commercial CAD system, tailored to a particular design domain. The domain of electronic packaging was selected due to its multidisciplinary nature and importance. We hope that through this experience, similar systems could be built and tailored to suite other engineering domains.
