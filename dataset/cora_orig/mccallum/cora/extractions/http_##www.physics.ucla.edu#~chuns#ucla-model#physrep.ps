Reference-contexts: Logically, the path flows from QCD (upper left in Fig.1) to comparisons with data (lower right). Historically, however, the development was exactly the opposite: We first noted (`UCLA stage I' in Fig.1) in 1987 <ref> [1] </ref> that if the Lund Symmetric Fragmentation Function [2,3] f (z; P T h (1 z) z b m h 2 (1) was used as a hadronic production density (i.e., with a constant normalization N for all hadrons), then the predicted rates agreed rather well with measured ones.

Reference-contexts: This, as will be seen, gives an adequate description of the data. We also note, however, that a different factor in e 2bP 2 from e bm 2 leads to a small Left-Right symmetry violation <ref> [2] </ref>. (2) In Fig.3, we have presumed that the initial q q pair are quite light and essentially travel along the light cone. This is a good approximations for up, down, and even strange quarks. <p> We note that using different factors for m 2 and for P T (i:e:; 2b=z) slightly violates left-right symmetry for the frag mentation function <ref> [2] </ref> 4) The fact that a virtual quark with non-negligible mass travels classically in a hyperbola rather than along the light-cone leads to z eff = 1 m 2 m 2 log m 2 to be used in the exponentials of the fragmentation function, where is the current quark mass and <p> This, for example, led implementors to randomly select the side from which the next iteration would be performed. In ~ 1983, the Lund group discovered a very powerful theorem <ref> [2] </ref>: namely, that if `Left-Right Symmetry' (that is, the same statistical results from the quark and antiquark sides) were demanded, then the fragmentation function had to be of the form f (z) = N z 2 Henceforth, they used this `Lund Symmetric Fragmentation Function' (LSFF) in all their treatments and discussions. <p> finds Q ' 1GeV ; that is, when the primary quark and antiquark are separated by 0:2 fm. 3) In their paper on Left-Right symmetry for the fragmentation function (i.e., the requirement for the same statistical distribution whether hadrons are peeled off from the primary quark side or antiquark side <ref> [2] </ref>), the Lund group obtained the distribution of break-up points as a function of invariant time squared () H () = C One finds, then, that H () peaks at = b 2 Fig. F.2.

Reference-contexts: The physics rationale for `s/u' <ref> [3] </ref> was that constituent strange quarks ( 150 MeV) were considerably more massive that up and down quarks ( 2 ~5 MeV) and therefore, via a WKB sort of argument, it was more difficult for the s and s of a virtual q q pair created from the colorfield to tunnel <p> Any such actual calculation was very approximate and so 64 a parameter was introduced, whose value was found to be 0:3 from various data comparisons, to phenomenologically describe this situation. Thus, this provided a rationale for strange hadron production being suppressed relative to non-strange production. The rationale for `vector/all' <ref> [3] </ref>, with some plausible arguments, was that the spatial wave function for a vector meson was harder for a q q pair to couple into than was the wave function of a pseudoscalar meson.

Reference-contexts: and vector/al l as used, for example, in the Lund implementation. (See Appendix A for a detailed comparison of the Lund and UCLA approaches.) After this initial phenomenological success, we then began, with some guidance from the Lund group, to develop the idea and form of the Event Weight Function <ref> [4] </ref> (`UCLA stage II' in Fig.1), recognizing in fact that it both (a) leads to the idea of using the Lund Symmetric Fragmentation Function with constant normalization as a hadronic production density as we were already doing phenomenologically, and (b) also begins to connect with QCD ideas. 1.2 Present UCLA emphasis

Reference-contexts: C) As the system continues to evolve, the parton shower evolves toward and then moves into a strong-coupled non-perturbative regime. D) QCD lattice work <ref> [9] </ref> indicates that, at quark-antiquark separation 1 ~ 2 fm, the colorfield is dominantly confined to a narrow tube of very high energy density (i.e., approximately a `string'). Thus, the system evolves toward a tube of colorfield, kinked by the more substantial gluon emis sions. <p> Lattice QCD work <ref> [9] </ref> within a Euclidean space-time metric indicates that, as a quark and antiquark separate, the color-field begins to collapse into a narrow tube-like structure approximately a `string' .

Reference-contexts: (ANNIH) ff = 5 (Fig.22 (d), (e) and (f)) (3) For any probed meson (DIS) or leading meson (ANNIH) ff = 2 (Fig.22 (b) and (c)) Note that QCD corrections would generally raise these values slightly and inclusion of `higher twist' terms would tend to lower the values of ff <ref> [16] </ref>. Comparisons with DIS data confirm that these predicted values of ff agree well [17,18] for each flavor of leading particle. It is interesting and gratifying to note that our best-fit value for `a' of 1.65 is close to the naive parton-level prediction of 2.0 for leading meson production.

Reference-contexts: Lattice QCD work [9] within a Euclidean space-time metric indicates that, as a quark and antiquark separate, the color-field begins to collapse into a narrow tube-like structure approximately a `string' . There is some very preliminary lattice-work indication <ref> [19] </ref> that, if virtual quark-antiquark pair production is allowed from the colorfield, then the energy density near the center of the string begins to drop that is, the string begins to break. <p> It is interesting to note that some lattice QCD work <ref> [19] </ref> suggests a noticable decrease of the flux tube in the middle when the quark and anti-quark are separated by 0:6 ~ 0:8 fm, which was the maximum separation in the study.

Reference-contexts: Because of the striking similarity to Wilson's lattice theory , numerous attempts have been made to connect string theory to QCD. Indeed in 1+1-dimensional space-time, the connection between the string model and lattice QCD was made precise <ref> [20] </ref>. As will be mentioned later again, this is the rationale to expect the outcome of string theory in 1+3 dimension to hold approximately in QCD.

Reference-contexts: This suggested structure not only supports the Event Weight Function, but also suggests an interesting possibility concerning the baryon production mechanism. The situation in Fig.26 (b) depicts a popcorn mechanism whereas the situation in Fig.26 (a) involves no popcorn. There have been numerous models to describe the popcorn mechanism <ref> [26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Among the recent trends <ref> [27] </ref> to avoid such difficulties is the technique of calculating the effective Lagrangian by treating a second quantized field theoretic object as a first quantized object (a world-line formalism). Typically this transcription results in a coordinate integration instead of a field and simplifies the Feynman path integration significantly.
