Abstract: Many functions of two variables have been proposed to extend the AND, OR, and NOT functions of logic from f0; 1g to [0; 1]. We give uniqueness theorems showing that the min, max, and (1 x) functions are the only choices which satisfy certain conditions. What a logician would regard as very weak conditions will force AND= min and OR= max, but all properties of interest to logicians are actually satisfied by a very large class of NOT functions.

Let c, 0 &lt; c &lt; 1, be an arbitrary constant, Let g (x), 0 x &lt; c, be an arbitrary continuous strictly decreasing function with g (0) = 1 and g (c) = c. <p> Corollary 2 The only increasing solution of q (q (x)) = x is q (x) = x.

Reference-contexts: The proof of theorem 5 is trivial. Theorem 4 was stated without proof in [3, p. 13]. We remark that by use of lemma 1, it may easily be shown that the involutory rational functions which obey h (0) = 1 and h (1) = 0 are precisely Sugano's <ref> [5] </ref> fuzzy NOT functions h (x) = (1 x)=(1 kx) where k, k &lt; 1, is any fixed real. 5 Uniqueness of the OR and AND functions Theorem 6 Associativity (property 2), idempotency (property 1), and the strict monotonicity condition (6) for OR suffice to force f (x; y) = max

Despite this, this function radically differs from max (x; y). This extreme sensitivity is also quite remarkable. We also mention that Vincze <ref> [6, Satz 1] </ref> has shown, in a result which almost, but not quite, contradicts ours, that the most general continuous associative functions f (x; y) which are strictly monotone in each argument, are f (x; y) = 1 ((x) + (y)) (4) where is continuous and strictly monotone, but otherwise arbitrary.

Still, the usual simple choice NOT (x) = 1 x may be forced by requiring NOT (x 1 2 ) 1 2 to have odd symmetry, These choices have been used before <ref> [7] </ref>, indeed they are one of the most common selections, but we have not seen uniqueness theorems of the sort we present. 2 A list of possible properties What sort of properties do we wish for fuzzified AND, OR, and NOT to obey?
