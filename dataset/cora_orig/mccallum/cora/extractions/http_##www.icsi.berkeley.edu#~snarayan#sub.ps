Title: Talking the Talk is Like Walking the Walk: A Computational Model of Verbal Aspect  
Author: Srini Narayanan

Abstract: I describe an implemented computational model of verbal aspect that supports the proposition that the semantics of aspect is grounded in sensory-motor primitives. In this theory, aspectual expressions refer to schema-tized processes that recur in sensory-motor control (such as goal, periodicity, iteration, final state, duration, and parameters such as force and effort). This active model of aspect grounded in sensory-motor primitives is able to model cross-linguistic variation in aspectual expressions while avoiding some paradoxes and problems in model-theoretic and other traditional accounts.

Reference-contexts: Figure 7 shows how the inherently iterative nature of certain activities can preferentially enable the iterate transition of the controller, generating the desired interpretation. Another example of a problem with the V DT classification comes from trying to classify verbs like die. Traditional accounts are forced to abandon composition-ality <ref> (Comrie 1976) </ref> and invent a new class of situations, which once started cannot be prevented. In our model (assuming Comrie's reading) this is simply done through preferential inhibition of the iterate and interrupt transitions of the controller shown in Figure 8. Perfectivizing Operators and finishes are.

Reference-contexts: Aspect is a particularly interesting phenomenon because in all languages studied, the natural or inherent verb semantics combine with and modify the interpretations and entailments of the grammatical marker system. This makes a compositional account of the semantics of aspect difficult giving rise to many paradoxes and problems <ref> (Dowty 1979) </ref>. This paper demonstrates that a compositional semantics of Aspect can be constructed if we take the embodiment of action in a neural system seriously. <p> Aspect Modifiers or other grammatical devices are like knobs which when set activate the corresponding controller node, sanctioning which inferences can be made 2 These parameters inspired by sensory motor primitives generalize Talmy's aspectual primitives (Talmy 1985) and can easily derive the Vendler-Taylor-Dowty classification V DT <ref> (Dowty 1979) </ref>. controller Schema which bind to process states or dynamic sub-processes generating interpretations and allowing for inferences. by the hearer, given the same underlying schema (verb form). <p> More importantly, using the perfect aspect the speaker sets the context that inferences relevant for future discourse are the world conditions and agent state as a consequence of having walked to the store. Imperfective Paradox The Imperfective Paradox <ref> (Dowty 1979) </ref> comes from trying to separate verbs of accomplishment from verbs of activity. <p> This creates what is referred to as the imperfective paradox, and model theoretic accounts are forced to invent new unanalyzed primitives such as the inertial world primitive Inr <ref> (Dowty 1979) </ref> (set of predictable world futures) to establish truth conditions that satisfy this test. described by the two sentences. <p> exposition purposes, the test-foot branch is not shown. 6 Goal attainment can be asynchronously asserted by a scheduled or unscheduled perceptual process (or can be time based (I saw Jack walking to the store yesterday)), and the X-schema reacts appropriately. of the relevant portion of the Marking vector Dowty's definition <ref> (Dowty 1979) </ref>). Technically the resolution of the paradox relies on whether the reachability graph of the active X-schema contains the result as a sub-marking, a question that can be answered by activation propagation over the X-schema.

Reference-contexts: We note that (Steedman 1995) proposes the use of dynamic logic to represent the semantics of Tense and Aspect. In this context, we are exploring the connection between X-schemas and a dynamic version of situation calculus. Other related work shows an equivalence between the multiplicative fragment of linear logic <ref> (Girard 1987) </ref> and X-schemas. Furthermore, there are similarities between X-schemas and connectionist models of general purpose reasoning (Grannes et al. 1997). We hope that such links may provide some answers regarding the interaction between deliberative and reactive cognitive processes.

Reference-contexts: The underlying model of an X-schema is a weighted, bipartite graph that consists of Places and Transitions. Input Arcs connect Places to Transitions, Output Arcs connect Transitions to Places. The bi-partite nature of the X-schema naturally captures the well known state/event distinction that pervades linguistic analysis <ref> (Langacker 1987) </ref>. In X-schemas, both states and events are distributed over the entire net. A specific state of the schema corresponds to a marking. Formally a marking is a function that assigns either 0 or a positive integer to each place.

Reference-contexts: The structure of the controller and the relevant set of features that characterize the verb jointly control the compositional possibilities. Computational Model The computational model of X-schemas is based on an extension to Petri nets <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>. Definition 1 . X-schema An X-schema consists of places ( P ) and Transitions ( T ) connected by weighted directed arcs A ( A 2 (P fi T ) [ (T fi P) ). <p> The reachability graph of a marked X-schema is thus isomorphic to a continuous time semi-markov process. The theorem is important to our effort since Petri nets are one of the most popular and well studied Computer Science formalisms for specifying, modeling, and analyzing highly distributed and concurrent systems <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>. Algorithms and analysis techniques from that literature can directly be brought in to our work. For instance, to model hierarchical action sets with variables and parameters, we extend the basic model to allow tokens to carry variable binding information (i.e. they are individuated and typed). <p> In our model (assuming Comrie's reading) this is simply done through preferential inhibition of the iterate and interrupt transitions of the controller shown in Figure 8. Perfectivizing Operators and finishes are. In this case, through a well defined net transformation <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>, we get a a simplified controller that (see Figure 9) corresponds to the the perfective perspective present in many languages (Lan-gacker 1987). Note that a perfective allows iteration but not interruption since there is no internal structure.

Reference-contexts: of colors can be unfolded into one with a single color. 3 While the firing rule semantics allows enabled Transitions to fire in a distributed manner using local clocks, our sequential simulation adjusts step size to be able to fire multiple enabled transitions. 4 The proof can be found in <ref> (Narayanan 1997) </ref>. Intuitively, the idea of the proof should be obvious to readers familiar with Petri nets, especially since I have used Petri net terminology in the definitions. <p> These provide independent evidence that the controller abstraction seems to capture the inherent temporal structure of events. An X-schema based model that can interpret metaphoric expressions about events is described in <ref> (Narayanan 1997) </ref>. Conclusion The main focus of this paper was to provide evidence for the proposition that the semantics of verbal aspect is grounded in primitives of sensory- motor control.

Reference-contexts: The active, dynamic, highly-responsive nature of X-schemas enables them to model real-time, defeasible inferences. This novel feature of our model distinguishes it from previous attempts to model Aspect (Moens 1988; Scheler 1996), and allows for a natural solution to the attendant issues of context-sensitivity and inference. We note that <ref> (Steedman 1995) </ref> proposes the use of dynamic logic to represent the semantics of Tense and Aspect. In this context, we are exploring the connection between X-schemas and a dynamic version of situation calculus.

For example in the cases He is rubbing ointment or He is coughing, the normal reading is inherently iterative. <ref> (Talmy 1985) </ref> points out that this has to do with the inherently iterative nature of certain activities. Figure 7 shows how the inherently iterative nature of certain activities can preferentially enable the iterate transition of the controller, generating the desired interpretation.
