Title: Network Resource Control in the Tandem ServerNet  
Date: March 7, 1996  
Pubnum: Router  
Abstract: Existing multicomputer network routers use simple arbitration techniques such as first-come-first-serve or round-robin which have significant limitations in supporting needs in emerging multicomputer architectures and applications. More flexible network resource control at the router level not only provides many benefits such as fair services, uniform resource utilization, and flexible topology support, but it is also essential to support multimedia and other real-time applications. We describe and evaluate a cost-effective network resource control algorithm called ALU-biasing arbitration. The ALU-biasing arbitration distributes output link bandwidth of a router to input links proportionally to programmed parameters. The algorithm has been implemented in the Tandem ServerNet router [17] at less than 10% of overall gate counts. The ALU-biased network can reserve virtually arbitrary amount of bandwidth to communication paths and actually can guarantee the reserved bandwidth, potentially supporting many new applications that require such. The ALU biasing arbitration also improves average network performance by evenly utilizing network resources. However, it also has limitations such as traffic coupling via shared physical links and difficulty in delay bounds guarantees. We examine and discuss the problems that ServerNet solves and remaining issues.

Reference-contexts: Whereas the ALU arbitration controls only based on physical links, Virtual Clock requires separate management of each virtual connection. Since the number of virtual connections increases at O (N 2 ), it cannot be directly implemented in low-cost routers.

However, its frame-based scheduling wastes network bandwidth, so it cannot support bursty data traffic efficiently.

In the recently introduced Tandem ServerNet <ref> [17] </ref>, the router employs a novel arbitration technique called ALU biasing arbitration. The router can be programmed on line so that arbitrary fraction of output link bandwidth can be reserved for different input links, and its novel arbitration policy allocates reserved bandwidth accurately.

Reference-contexts: Also, since controls are based on local router states, it is difficult to redistribute unclaimed bandwidth dynamically at the system level, restricting redistribution only to a local router. Recently, there have been several works on service guarantees in high-performance networks. In <ref> [22] </ref>, the RACE network for parallel systems for embedded applications uses preemptible circuit switching, supporting low worst-case delays for high-priority messages. In [31], CODA, a real-time parallel machine also guarantees the delay bounds by forwarding blocked packets' priority in order to avoid priority conversions in the network.

Reference-contexts: We first observe in Figure 11-(a), that in the mesh network, ALU-biased routers slightly increase network throughput compared to round-robin routers. Mesh networks are asymmetric, so link utilization is inherently unbalanced; links in the center are utilized more than links at the edge, forming a bottleneck <ref> [24] </ref>. This is true regardless of routing algorithms. The round-robin scheduling simply gives more bandwidth of these highly utilized links to nodes in the center. So, nodes at the edge are saturated at lower load rates.

Reference-contexts: With ALU-biased routers, we can achieve uniform resource utilization even in the simpler asymmetric connection topologies. ALU-biased routers can also improve performance of many parallel applications by reducing the variance in communication delays <ref> [25] </ref>. Network resource control also provides system-level supports in several respects. For instance, system scaling should be much simpler since it can support arbitrary network topologies efficiently. Since nodes can receive fair system services independent of relative locations of peripherals, task placements should be simpler.
