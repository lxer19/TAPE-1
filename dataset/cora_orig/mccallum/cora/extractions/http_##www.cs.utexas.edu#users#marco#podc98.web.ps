Title: Stabilizing Maximum Metric Routing (Extended Abstract)  
Author: Mohamed G. Gouda Marco Schneider 
Note: IGRP protocol is not optimizable along a tree.  
Abstract: We formally define routing metrics and provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a routing metric to be optimizable along a tree. Based on these conditions, we present a generalization of the distance-vector paradigm which we call the maximum metric tree. We present a stabilizing protocol for constructing maximum metric trees. Our protocol demonstrates that the distance-vector routing paradigm may be extended to any routing metric that is optimizable along a tree and in a self-stabilizing manner. Examples include shortest path trees (distance-vector), depth first search trees, maximum flow trees and reliability trees. We present an enhanced version of our protocol with the following desirable property: while the tree is being updated in response to changes in the network, it always remains a tree. We also investigate the composition of optimizable routing metrics and present the conditions under which optimality is preserved. Finally we show that the routing metric used by Cisco's popular

A network N is a connected and undirected graph whose set of vertices is V and whose set of edges is E.

Reference-contexts: Enhanced IGRP is based on the same metric as IGRP, but replaces its heuristics with 9 coordinated updates via diffusing computations. This protocol is documented in a paper available from Cisco [Far93] (see also <ref> [AGB94] </ref>), and its tree maintenance is based on the diffusing update algorithm (DUAL) of Garcia-Luna-Aceves [Gar93]. The diffusing update algorithm was developed for shortest paths and the use of a composite metric results in a different behaviour than what is described in the respective papers.

Reference-contexts: Each entry in a distance-vector corresponds to a particular destination and contains the current distance estimate of the shortest path from the source to the corresponding destination. In this way a separate tree is constructed for each destination in the network. In <ref> [CD94] </ref> the distance-vector approach approach was extended to self-stabilizing depth first search tree construction. In [GS94] we introduced maximum flow trees and extended the distance vector approach to the stabilizing construction of maximum flow trees (see also [GS95, Sch97]). <p> In this paper, motivated by the extension of the distance-vector paradigm to maximum flow trees, we show how to further extend the distance-vector paradigm to arbitrary routing metrics in a self-stabilizing manner. In related work, Afek and Bremler [AB97] were similarly motivated by the work of Collin and Dolev <ref> [CD94] </ref> to come up with a general approach to the more general problem of leader election and tree construction. Our work is distinguished from that of Afek and Bremler in a number of important ways due to our focus on routing. <p> A full description of how to encode depth first search trees appears in [Sch97] and will also appear in the full paper. The resultant protocol is similar to the one appearing in <ref> [CD94] </ref>. Numerous other applications may be found by choosing the appropriate metrics. As an example we discuss reliability trees. In Section 8 we will also give an encoding of the metric used by the IGRP protocol.

Reference-contexts: Thus there is need for quality of service based routing protocols in the Internet <ref> [CNRS97] </ref>. The primary task of a routing protocol is to generate and maintain a tree with the appropriate desirable properties (e.g., shortest path, maximum flow, etc.). As the topology and available resources of a network change over time, this may necessitate that the tree be updated or rebuilt.

Reference-contexts: For the enhanced protocol we would need to add an additional (third) round after maximizing flow that reduced the distance. An alternative approach to the one we have taken is to utilize a self-stabilizing diffusing update algorithm. In <ref> [CW97] </ref> such a protocol is presented in the context of maximum flow routing. This protocol can be extended to work for any bounded and monotonic metric.

Reference-contexts: The protocol we have presented is with respect to a single destination, but it generalizes to any set of destinations. Further the protocol generalizes the distance-vector paradigm by allowing neighboring vertices to exchange their estimates for arbitrary metrics. Finally it is worth noting that the presented protocol is silent <ref> [DGS96] </ref>. There are many well known instantiations of the maximum metric tree protocol including breadth first search (shortest path) trees, depth first search trees, maximum flow trees and reliability trees.

A desirable property for any tree protocol is that while updating the tree, it always remains a tree. We call this property tree maintenance.

Reference-contexts: In [CD94] the distance-vector approach approach was extended to self-stabilizing depth first search tree construction. In [GS94] we introduced maximum flow trees and extended the distance vector approach to the stabilizing construction of maximum flow trees (see also <ref> [GS95, Sch97] </ref>). Define the flow of a path as the minimum capacity of an edge along that path. A maximum flow tree in a network is a rooted spanning tree of the network wherein the path from any vertex to the root is a maximum flow path. <p> (d:v 6= min (d:w + 1; D) _ (f:v 6= met (f:w; c [w])) [] p:v 6= w ^ (d:w &lt; D 1)^ ! p:v; d:v; f:v := w; d:w + 1; met (f:w; c [w]) The correctness of the protocol is divided into two parts; Closure and Convergence. (See <ref> [Sch97] </ref> for the details which will appear also appear in the full paper.) Before we can formally state these properties, we need to define the concepts of protocol states, fixed points, and computations. <p> There are many well known instantiations of the maximum metric tree protocol including breadth first search (shortest path) trees, depth first search trees, maximum flow trees and reliability trees. A full description of how to encode depth first search trees appears in <ref> [Sch97] </ref> and will also appear in the full paper. The resultant protocol is similar to the one appearing in [CD94]. Numerous other applications may be found by choosing the appropriate metrics. As an example we discuss reliability trees. <p> For instance in the case of maximum flow trees, as virtual circuits are allocated and deallocated the available edge capacities may change and a new maximum flow tree must be built to reflect the new edge values <ref> [Sch97, GS95] </ref>. A desirable property for any tree protocol is that while updating the tree, it always remains a tree. We call this property tree maintenance. Adding tree maintenance is well known area of research in distance-vector routing protocols. <p> For the benefit of the reader we have included the full details of the protocol in Appendix A. The proof of correctness appears in <ref> [Sch97] </ref> and will also appear in the full paper. We can also design an enhanced maximum metric tree protocol for a bounded nonmonotonic composite metric if it is composed of a sequence of bounded monotonic metrics ordered by preference. We do this as follows. <p> This is because the composite ordered metric of flow and distance is nonmonotonic. A detailed example of this is provided in <ref> [Sch97] </ref> and will also appear in the full paper. 7 Composition of Optimizable Metrics In this section we present several basic results about the composition of arbitrary optimizable metrics. <p> The default formula for IGRP is simply the sum of the inverse bandwidth and the distance. The complete details of the IGRP metric and its analysis will be described in the full paper and also appear in <ref> [Sch97] </ref>. This metric is bounded but it is not monotonic. Boundedness is easy to see. Consider that inverse bandwidth can only increase or maintain its value and distance can only increase. Since we are minimizing along nondecreasing paths, the metric is bounded.

Reference-contexts: A maximum flow tree in a network is a rooted spanning tree of the network wherein the path from any vertex to the root is a maximum flow path. Maximum flow trees were independently discovered by <ref> [WC95] </ref>, although not in the context of self-stabilization. In this paper, motivated by the extension of the distance-vector paradigm to maximum flow trees, we show how to further extend the distance-vector paradigm to arbitrary routing metrics in a self-stabilizing manner.
