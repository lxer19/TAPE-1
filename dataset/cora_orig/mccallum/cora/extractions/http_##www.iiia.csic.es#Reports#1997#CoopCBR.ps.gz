Abstract: We are investigating possible modes of cooperation among homogeneous agents with learning capabilities. In this paper we will be focused on agents that learn and solve problems using Case-based Reasoning (CBR), and we will present two modes of cooperation among them: Distributed Case-based Reasoning (DistCBR) and Collective Case-based Reasoning (ColCBR). We illustrate these modes with an application where different CBR agents able to recommend chromatography techniques for protein purification cooperate. The approach taken is to extend Noos, the representation language being used by the CBR agents. Noos is knowledge modeling framework designed to integrate learning methods and based on the task/method decomposition principle. The extension we present, Plural Noos, allows communication and cooperation among agents implemented in Noos by means of three basic constructs: alien references, foreign method evaluation, and mobile methods.

Reference-contexts: A method can be elementary or can be decomposed in subtasks. These new (sub)tasks can be achieved by corresponding methods in the same way. For a given task there may be multiple alternative methods (alternative ways to solve the task). For instance, a CBR method <ref> [1] </ref> is decomposed into the retrieve, select and reuse subtasks and there are several possible methods to achieve each subtask. Decision-taking in Noos is modeled by a preference language that allows the specification of the conditions in which an alternative is better than others.
