Abstract: Previous dialogue systems have focussed on dialogues between two agents. Many applications, however, require conversations between several participants. This paper extends speech act definitions to handle multi-agent conversations, based on a model of multi-agent belief attribution with some unique properties. Our approach has the advantage of capturing a number of interesting phenomena in a straightforward way. The rise of spoken language NLP applications has led to increased interest in such issues as real time processing and on-line error recovery. But dialogue is an inherently online process; this manifests in such linguistic phenomena as turntaking [ Sacks et al., 1974 ] , repair [ Schegloff et al., 1977 ] , and content grounding [ Clark and Schaefer, 1989 ] . Grounding is the phenomenon that establishes shared beliefs, for which simply making or hearing an utterance does not suffice. It makes hearers into full participants who actively signal success or failure of communication, as in this exchange: Our long term goal is to show how, from the perspective of a participant, one plans and acts in an environment with other communicating individuals, even when those other individuals are not perfectly reliable, and even when the groups involved may be large enough that it is impractical to model all participants. For example, consider this familiar exchange, from the point of view of someone who remembers that the next group meeting is on tuesday: Jan : so we should drop the mm . cancel the Here both our subject and another participant offer a correction, which is confirmed by Lou and by the original speaker. Other participants may be present. In this paper, we focus on the effects of communicative actions on the participant's model of the situation. In contrast with previous dialogue work, we are fl The work underlying this paper was supported by a research grant, FKZ ITW 9002 0, from the German Bundes-ministerium fur Forschung und Technologie to the DFKI project DISCO. The advantages of analysing natural language utterances as communicative actions are by now well understood; they serve to summarise conversations for long-term storage [ Schupeta, 1993 ] , as a basis for generation [ Moore and Paris, 1989 ] , in top-down prediction of utterance function and structure [ Alexandersson et al., 1994 ] , and most importantly, to provide a representation of natural language utterances that is uniform with that used in general facilities for planning and action [ Allen, 1983 ] . We follow [ Traum and Hinkelman, 1992 ] in regarding speech acts as fully joint actions between conversational participants. Not only are joint speech acts co-operatively undertaken, but they have at least nominally joint effects: if they complete but still fail to result in shared goals or shared beliefs, this should be attributable to politeness, dishonesty (cf. [ Perrault, 1990 ] ), or other social functions. Consider, for instance, the case in which you believe that the government knows your income from last year. What you believe is not that each individual government employee knows it, but that anyone from the tax department, whose business it is to know, and who actually wants to, will. Thus we would typically assume that an employee of the tax department who, in a professional capacity, makes contact with your accountant, would actually have this information to hand. We want to abstract away from the communi meeting on thursday.

Reference-contexts: The idea here is that while participating in (or directly observing) a conversation, the system is in a position to observe the construction of the public record of that conversation <ref> [ Lewis, 1983 ] </ref> directly, and this record consists exactly to the attitudes we wish to ascribe to the conversational group itself. In conversation even a new `unspoken understanding' should be based on inference from observed communication, and not just the system's private beliefs about other participants' views.
