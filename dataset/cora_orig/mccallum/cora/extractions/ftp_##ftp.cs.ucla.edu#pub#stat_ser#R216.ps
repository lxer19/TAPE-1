Reference-contexts: The transformation in Eq. (6) exhibits all the properties we normally associate with actions, and it was therefore proposed as a solution to the frame problem and its two satellites, the ramification problem and the concurrency problem <ref> [Darwiche & Pearl 1994, Pearl 1994a] </ref>. For example, to represent the intervention "turning the sprinkler ON" in the Judea Pearl / Bayesian Networks 6 network of Figure 1, we delete the link X 1 ! X 3 and fix the value of X 3 to ON. <p> This combination of infinitesimal probabilities with the causal information encoded by the structure of Bayesian networks facilitates linguistic communication of belief commitments, explanations, actions, goals, and preferences, and serves as the basis for current research on qualitative planning under uncertainty <ref> [Darwiche & Pearl 1994, Goldszmidt & Pearl 1992, Pearl 1994b] </ref>. 6 DISCUSSION The most distinctive characteristics of Bayesian networks are their ability to faithfully represent causal relationships, to combine top-down and bottom-up inferences, and to adapt to changing conditions by updating the probability measures attached to the links.

Reference-contexts: Using Dawid's notation <ref> [Dawid 1979] </ref>, we can state this set of independencies as X i k fX 1 ; X 2 ; :::; X i1 gnpa i j pa i i = 2; :::; n (3) Such a set of independencies is called Markovian, since it reflects the Markovian condition for state transitions: each

Reference-contexts: P (x i j pa i ) if x i = x 0 0 if x i 6= x 0 (6) which reflects the removal of the term P (x i j pa i ) from the product decomposition of Eq. (1), since pa i no longer influence X i <ref> [Goldszmidt & Pearl 1992] </ref>. Graphically, the removal of this term is equivalent to removing the links between pa i and X i while keeping the rest of the network intact [Spirtes et al. 1993]. Transformations involving conjunctive actions can be obtained by straightforward generalization of Eq. (6). <p> Such sentences, often named plain beliefs, exhibit both logical and probabilistic character. As in classical logic, they are propositional and deductively closed; as in probability, they are subject to retraction and to varying degrees of entrenchment <ref> [Goldszmidt & Pearl 1992] </ref>. Bayesian networks can be adopted to model the dynamics of plain beliefs by replacing ordinary probabilities with non-standard probabilities, that is, probabilities that are infinitesimally close to either zero or one. <p> This combination of infinitesimal probabilities with the causal information encoded by the structure of Bayesian networks facilitates linguistic communication of belief commitments, explanations, actions, goals, and preferences, and serves as the basis for current research on qualitative planning under uncertainty <ref> [Darwiche & Pearl 1994, Goldszmidt & Pearl 1992, Pearl 1994b] </ref>. 6 DISCUSSION The most distinctive characteristics of Bayesian networks are their ability to faithfully represent causal relationships, to combine top-down and bottom-up inferences, and to adapt to changing conditions by updating the probability measures attached to the links.

Reference-contexts: Judea Pearl / Bayesian Networks 7 The first algorithms proposed for probability updating in Bayesian networks used message-passing architecture and were limited to trees [Pearl 1982] and singly connected networks <ref> [Kim 1983] </ref>. The idea was to assign each variable a simple processor, forced to communicate only with its neighbors, and to permit asynchronous back-and-forth message-passing until equilibrium was achieved.

Reference-contexts: The potential for the network to work as a computational architecture, and hence as Judea Pearl / Bayesian Networks 3 a model of cognitive activities, was noted in <ref> [Pearl 1982] </ref>, where a distributed scheme was demonstrated for probabilistic updating on tree-structured networks. The motivation behind this particular development was the modeling of distributed processing in reading comprehension, where both top-down and bottom-up inferences are combined to form a coherent interpretation. <p> Judea Pearl / Bayesian Networks 7 The first algorithms proposed for probability updating in Bayesian networks used message-passing architecture and were limited to trees <ref> [Pearl 1982] </ref> and singly connected networks [Kim 1983].

The isomorphism between the topology of Bayesian networks and the stable mechanisms that operate in the environment facilitates modular reconfiguration of the network in response to changing conditions, and permits deliberative reasoning about novel situations.

Reference-contexts: The distinction Judea Pearl / Bayesian Networks 5 between transitive and intransitive dependencies is the basis for the causal discovery systems of <ref> [Pearl & Verma 1991] </ref> and [Spirtes et al. 1993] (see Section 5). <p> The connection is made in the mechanism-based account of causation. The basic idea behind this account goes back to H. Simon and it was adapted in <ref> [Pearl & Verma 1991] </ref> for defining probabilistic causal theories, as follows. <p> One of the most exciting prospects in recent years has been the possibility of using Bayesian networks to discover causal structures in raw statistical data. Several systems have been developed for this purpose <ref> [Pearl & Verma 1991, Spirtes et al. 1993] </ref>. Technically, such discovery is feasible only if one is willing to accept weaker forms of guarantees weaker than those obtained through controlled randomized experiments: minimality and stability [Pearl & Verma 1991]. <p> Several systems have been developed for this purpose [Pearl & Verma 1991, Spirtes et al. 1993]. Technically, such discovery is feasible only if one is willing to accept weaker forms of guarantees weaker than those obtained through controlled randomized experiments: minimality and stability <ref> [Pearl & Verma 1991] </ref>. Minimality guarantees that any other structure compatible with the data is necessarily less specific, and hence less falsifiable and less trustworthy, than the one (s) inferred.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a DAG can be viewed as an efficient scheme for representing Markovian independence assumptions and for deducing and displaying all the logical consequences of such assumptions. Additional properties of DAGs and their applications to evidential reasoning in expert systems are discussed in <ref> [Pearl 1988, Shachter 1990, Spiegelhalter et al. 1993] </ref>. 3.2 Bayesian Networks as Carriers of Causal Information The interpretation of DAGs as carriers of independence assumptions does not necessarily imply causation and will in fact be valid for any set of Markovian independencies along any ordering (not necessarily causal or chronological) of

Reference-contexts: The distinction Judea Pearl / Bayesian Networks 5 between transitive and intransitive dependencies is the basis for the causal discovery systems of [Pearl & Verma 1991] and <ref> [Spirtes et al. 1993] </ref> (see Section 5). However, the Markovian account still leaves open the question of how such intricate patterns of independencies relate to the more basic notions associated with causation, such as influence, manipulation, and control, which reside outside the province of probability theory. <p> Graphically, the removal of this term is equivalent to removing the links between pa i and X i while keeping the rest of the network intact <ref> [Spirtes et al. 1993] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, Bayesian networks can model a wide spectrum of cognitive activities, ranging from low-level perception (reaction) to planning and explaining (deliberation). 2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Networks employing directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have a long and rich tradition, which began with the geneticist Sewall Wright <ref> [Wright 1921] </ref>. He developed a method called path analysis, which later became an established representation of causal models in economics, sociology, and psychology. Recursive models is the name given to such networks by statisticians seeking meaningful and effective decompositions of contingency tables.
