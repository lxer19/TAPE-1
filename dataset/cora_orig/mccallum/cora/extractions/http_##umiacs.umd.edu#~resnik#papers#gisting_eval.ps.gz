Title: Evaluating Multilingual Gisting of Web Pages  
Author: Philip Resnik

Affiliation: Department of Linguistics and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies University of Maryland  
Abstract: We describe a prototype system for multilingual gisting of Web pages, and present an evaluation methodology based on the notion of gisting as decision support. This evaluation paradigm is straightforward, rigorous, permits fair comparison of alternative approaches, and should easily generalize to evaluation in other situations where the user is faced with decision-making on the basis of information in restricted or alternative form.

Reference-contexts: Word-by-word lookup and presentation in this system (Steps 3c and 3d) resemble the direct lexical approach to machine translation investigated and thoroughly criticized in the 1960s <ref> (ALPAC 1966) </ref>. Notably, however, the problem attacked by those early efforts was one of full scale translation, not gisting. We would contend that with the rise of the World Wide Web, those early solutions have finally found the right problem.

Reference-contexts: Avoid full-scale machine translation. The user's problem would certainly be solved by a fully automatic translation of the Web page under consideration. Unfortunately, the state of the art in high quality machine translation is typically measured in words per minute rather than pages per minute <ref> (Dorr 1996) </ref>, so even if it is possible to obtain a translation for the page, the user is still faced with the decision of whether or not it is worth sacrificing the time to obtain it. Keep the human in the loop.

Reference-contexts: Small sub-document units (e.g. list items) motivate taking an approach to automated language identification (Step 3a) that can work well even when the strings to be identified are very short and cannot be relied upon to contain function words <ref> (Dunning 1994) </ref>. Depending on the language, different measures must be taken in order to identify words (Step 3b). For example, in many Asian languages words are typically not delimited by spaces, and therefore automatic word segmentation is necessary (Matsumoto 1995).

Reference-contexts: In an environment where human beings are attempting to gist radio traffic, for example, radio operators need to decide whether or not to route information to electronic warfare analysts <ref> (Elsaesser 1996) </ref>. Accordingly, in order to evaluate a particular method for gisting, one must examine the extent to which gisting supports a decision-making task.

Reference-contexts: We also computed lower bounds with the computer making a forced choice, i.e. not allowing random selection to pick the "none of the above" category; the results differed negligibly. Analysis The categorization data gathered in the experiment were analyzed following the method of Hripcsak et al. <ref> (Hripcsak et al. 1995) </ref>. In their study, they compared the performance of physicians, laypersons, and several computer programs on the task of classifying chest radiograph reports according to the presence or absence of 6 medical conditions.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the language, different measures must be taken in order to identify words (Step 3b). For example, in many Asian languages words are typically not delimited by spaces, and therefore automatic word segmentation is necessary <ref> (Matsumoto 1995) </ref>. This contrasts with Romance languages such as Spanish, where words are generally delimited by spaces or punctuation but a small subset of the lexical items in the language must be identified and separated out (e.g. Spanish damelo = da + me + lo).

Reference-contexts: Given the simplicity of the approach, the main limiting factor in adding more languages to the list is the availability of bilingual dictionaries, though we expect that this problem may be ameliorated to some extent by automatic algorithms for acquisition of bilingual lexicons <ref> (Melamed 1996) </ref>. Evaluation Design Criteria The gisted text that appears in Figure 2 bears little resemblance to an English translation of the Japanese content in Figure 1.
