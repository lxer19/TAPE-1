Abstract: A watermark is an invisible mark placed on an image that can be detected when the image is compared with the original. This mark is designed to identify both the source of an image as well as its intended recipient. The aims of this paper are to present an overview of watermarking techniques and to demonstrate a solution to one of the key problems in image watermarking, namely how to hide robust invisible labels inside grey scale or colour digital images.

Reference-contexts: Watermarking may be considered as being an application of spread spectrum communications [21]. The Shannon limit may be approached by applying error control codes. Methods for error control coding are described by Sweeney [27], Chambers [5] and Blahut <ref> [1] </ref>. Information theory also gives some insights into where the watermark should be placed. <p> The encoded message consists of 32 bits ("0123" in ASCII). The watermark was placed using a DCT and the perturbation in the coefficient values was 10. JPEG was applied with a standard setting of 50 and no smoothing was used. By judicious use of concatenated error control codes <ref> [1, 5, 27] </ref> the watermark was recovered with ease from this cropped section. It is apparent upon examining the watermarks in Figures 4, 5 and 7 that the transform based marking schemes possess a number of desirable features. One can mark according to the distribution of energy within the coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Dautzenberg and Boland [8] and Caronni <ref> [4] </ref> have investigated a very simple technique for embedding watermarks in images. An image is divided up into blocks. The mean of each block may then be incremented to encode a `1' or decremented to encode a `0' (or vice versa). This is termed bi-directional coding. <p> This is termed unidirectional coding. The block-mean approach suffers from the grave disadvantage that an enemy that is in possession of a number of independent copies of the image can compare the different copies and read most, if not all, of the encoded message. Caronni <ref> [4] </ref> shows that the expected number of undetected bits decreases exponentially with the number of copies. Caronni combats this particular weakness by randomizing both the size of the blocks as well as the positions of the blocks inside the image. <p> Caronni combats this particular weakness by randomizing both the size of the blocks as well as the positions of the blocks inside the image. Despite its simplicity, the block-mean method of marking images has proven to be highly robust to lossy image compression, photocopying and colour scanning and dithering <ref> [4, 8] </ref>. The number of bits that may be encoded using the block-mean approach equals the number of blocks, and this in turn depends on the size of the image and the block size, as well as the width of borders around blocks. <p> The inner block size is 12fi12 pixels and the pixels are incremented by 3 to transmit a binary '1' and decremented by 3 to convey a binary '0'. The mark is for all intents and purposes invisible in Figure 1 but may be detected quite readily <ref> [4, 8] </ref> even after lossy compression and scanning have been carried out. The watermark conveys 441 bits of information in ASCII form and the standard message reads: "012345 This is a watermark...".

In particular, the statistical characteristics of the watermarking channel need careful study. It is known that the distribution of the DCT coefficients of a typical image is well approximated by a Laplacian distribution <ref> [6] </ref>. It has been observed that the noise distortion imposed on the watermark by common image processing operations is non-Gaussian and impulsive in nature. Soft error control codes designed for additive wideband Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels (e.g. Reed-Muller codes) are not particularly effective in this application.

Reference-contexts: Later we shall describe a method which fulfils all of the above requirements. In this paper, we argue that watermarking needs to be adaptive in order to be robust. In direct contrast to many other techniques, with the notable exception of Cox et al. <ref> [7] </ref>, the method here places the watermark on the most perceptually significant components of an image. The logic behind the premise is quite simple. A watermark that is non-intrusive is one which resembles the image it is designed to protect. <p> Their approach to hiding a watermark is to make the watermark resemble quantization noise. To a certain extent, their approach can be considered to be perceptually adaptive because quantization noise is concentrated around edges and textured features. Cox et al. <ref> [7] </ref> believe that this method may not be robust to cropping. O Ruanaidh, Dowling and Boland [17] and Cox et al. [7] have developed perceptually adaptive transform domain methods for watermarking. <p> To a certain extent, their approach can be considered to be perceptually adaptive because quantization noise is concentrated around edges and textured features.

In direct contrast to previous approaches listed above the emphasis was on embedding the watermark in the most significant components of an image. The general approach used in these papers is to divide the image into blocks. <p> The watermark is also irregularly distributed over the entire image sub-block which makes it more difficult for enemies in possession of independent copies of the image to decode and to read the mark. The scheme described by Cox et al. <ref> [7] </ref> differs from that used by O Ruanaidh et al. [17] in several ways. The main differences lie in the detection and decoding of the mark. Cox et al. embed a unique Gaussian distributed sequence into the coefficients. <p> In this case, I max = 2 fl 2 Note that equation 7 would seem to support the use of a Gaussian distributed watermark such as that used by Cox et al. <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Walton [32] has developed a technique for introducing checksums in the least significant bits of an image to implement a fragile watermark and thus prevent unauthorized tampering. Dautzenberg and Boland <ref> [8] </ref> examined the use of the least significant bits as a possible scheme for introducing watermarks into images. <p> Second, from communications theory, it is well known that phase modulation can possess superior noise immunity when compared to amplitude modulation. 3 The block mean approach In this section, we present an algorithm that forms the basis of understanding more sophisticated transform domain algorithms described later. Dautzenberg and Boland <ref> [8] </ref> and Caronni [4] have investigated a very simple technique for embedding watermarks in images. An image is divided up into blocks.

Reference-contexts: Dautzenberg and Boland [8] examined the use of the least significant bits as a possible scheme for introducing watermarks into images. This approach gave very poor results because standard lossy compression schemes, such as JPEG <ref> [20] </ref>, tend to have the effect of randomizing the least significant bits during the quantization stage of image compression.

Indeed, later in the paper examples of the use of other transforms for watermarking will be presented. The following algorithm, which is adapted from JPEG <ref> [20] </ref> image compression and which is a hybrid between amplitude modulation and frequency shift keying, has been applied to watermarking: 1.

The second principle, which we shall outline briefly is that of Spread Spectrum Communications <ref> [21] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. First, a brief re-view of work carried out by other authors is presented. Next we describe transform domain watermarking algorithms which we have developed and which satisfy the constraints listed above. We then present a description of spread spectrum communication techniques. <p> An analogous situa tion occurs in satellite and mobile communications where SNR is limited by power restrictions at the transmitter. Watermarking may be considered as being an application of spread spectrum communications <ref> [21] </ref>. The Shannon limit may be approached by applying error control codes. Methods for error control coding are described by Sweeney [27], Chambers [5] and Blahut [1]. Information theory also gives some insights into where the watermark should be placed.

Reference-contexts: However, we have not yet addressed the other main component in the watermarking problem, namely the reliable transmission of the watermark. Reliable communication was proven by Shannon <ref> [26] </ref> to be theoretically possible providing the information rate does not exceed a threshold known as the channel capacity.

Reference-contexts: Watermarking may be considered as being an application of spread spectrum communications [21]. The Shannon limit may be approached by applying error control codes. Methods for error control coding are described by Sweeney <ref> [27] </ref>, Chambers [5] and Blahut [1]. Information theory also gives some insights into where the watermark should be placed. <p> The encoded message consists of 32 bits ("0123" in ASCII). The watermark was placed using a DCT and the perturbation in the coefficient values was 10. JPEG was applied with a standard setting of 50 and no smoothing was used. By judicious use of concatenated error control codes <ref> [1, 5, 27] </ref> the watermark was recovered with ease from this cropped section. It is apparent upon examining the watermarks in Figures 4, 5 and 7 that the transform based marking schemes possess a number of desirable features. One can mark according to the distribution of energy within the coefficients.

Reference-contexts: The resemblance of this technique to frequency hop spread spectrum communications is mentioned by the authors [33]. Zhao and Koch also take the precaution of placing the blocks at random positions in the image in order to make a successful attack by an enemy less likely. Tirkel et al. <ref> [28, 29] </ref> and van Schyndel et al. [30, 31] have applied the properties of m-sequences to produce watermarks that are resistant to filtering, image cropping and are reasonably robust to cryptographic attack. The original image is not required to decode the mark.

Matsui and Tanaka [15] have applied linear predictive coding for watermarking video, facsimile, dithered binary pictures and colour and grey scale images. Their approach to hiding a watermark is to make the watermark resemble quantization noise.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the texture of the image and the quality of a computer monitor, it is possible to exploit the limited dynamic range of the human eye to hide low quality images within other images. Walton <ref> [32] </ref> has developed a technique for introducing checksums in the least significant bits of an image to implement a fragile watermark and thus prevent unauthorized tampering. Dautzenberg and Boland [8] examined the use of the least significant bits as a possible scheme for introducing watermarks into images.

Reference-contexts: This approach gave very poor results because standard lossy compression schemes, such as JPEG [20], tend to have the effect of randomizing the least significant bits during the quantization stage of image compression. Zhao and Koch <ref> [33] </ref> have investigated an approach to watermarking images based on the JPEG [20] image compression algorithm. Their approach is to segment the image into individual 8 fi 8 blocks. Only eight coefficients occupying particular positions in the 8 fi 8 block of DCT coefficients can be marked. <p> Three of the remaining DCT coefficients are selected using a pseudo random number generator to convey information. The resemblance of this technique to frequency hop spread spectrum communications is mentioned by the authors <ref> [33] </ref>. Zhao and Koch also take the precaution of placing the blocks at random positions in the image in order to make a successful attack by an enemy less likely.
