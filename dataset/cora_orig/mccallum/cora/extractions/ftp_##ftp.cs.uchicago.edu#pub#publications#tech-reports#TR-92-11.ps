Abstract: We conjecture that every finite group G has a short presentation (in terms of generators and relations) in the sense that the total length of the relations is (log jGj) O(1) . We show that it suffices to prove this conjecture for simple groups. Motivated by applications in computational complexity theory, we conjecture that for finite simple groups, such a short presentation is computable in polynomial time from the standard name of G, assuming in the case of Lie type simple groups over GF (p m ) that an irreducible polynomial f of degree m over GF (p) and a primitive root of GF (p m ) are given. We verify this (stronger) conjecture for all finite simple groups except for the three families of rank 1 twisted groups: we do not handle the unitary groups P SU (3; q) = 2 A 2 (q), the Suzuki groups Sz(q) = 2 B 2 (q), and the Ree groups R(q) = 2 G 2 (q). In particular, all finite groups G without composition factors of these types have presentations of length O((log jGj) 3 ). For groups of Lie type (normal or twisted) of rank 2, we use a reduced version of the Curtis-Steinberg-Tits presentation.

Reference-contexts: The rank 1 case, i.e., the groups P SL (2; q), was settled in [Tod36]. We will need some standard terminology involving Chevalley groups. Our main references are Steinberg's lecture notes [Ste67] and Carter's book <ref> [Car72] </ref>. Each Chevalley group G has a central extension b G called a universal Chevalley group. If Z denotes the center of b G then G = b G=Z; moreover b G 0 = b G (where 0 denotes the commutator subgroup). <p> Specifically, the center Z is contained in the Cartan subgroup H and thus <ref> [Car72, Section 12.1] </ref> consists of elements of the form h ff 1 (t 1 ) h ff n (t n ) (8) (recall (5)), where ff 1 ; : : : ; ff n are the fundamental roots in + and the elements t i 2 GF (q) fl are chosen <p> So it only remains to consider which values of t i put (8) into the center Z. These are easily found by matrix computations in specific cases; in general (see <ref> [Car72, Section 12.1] </ref>) Z consists of exactly those elements (8) for which n Y t i = 1 for j = 1; : : : ; n: (9) Example 5.3. <p> Furthermore, each "root subgroup" of the twisted group corresponds to parts of one or more root subgroups in the untwisted group (cf. <ref> [Car72, x13.6] </ref>; for ff short, our x ff (t) here corresponds to x S (t) = x r (t)x r ( t) in Carter's notation [Car72, 13.6.4 (ii)], and our h ff (u) corresponds to h r (u)h r (u) [Car72, 13.7.2]). <p> Furthermore, each "root subgroup" of the twisted group corresponds to parts of one or more root subgroups in the untwisted group (cf. [Car72, x13.6]; for ff short, our x ff (t) here corresponds to x S (t) = x r (t)x r ( t) in Carter's notation <ref> [Car72, 13.6.4 (ii)] </ref>, and our h ff (u) corresponds to h r (u)h r (u) [Car72, 13.7.2]). Thus the relations (H2) can be verified in G by straightforward calculations using the corresponding relations for the untwisted group. <p> one or more root subgroups in the untwisted group (cf. [Car72, x13.6]; for ff short, our x ff (t) here corresponds to x S (t) = x r (t)x r ( t) in Carter's notation [Car72, 13.6.4 (ii)], and our h ff (u) corresponds to h r (u)h r (u) <ref> [Car72, 13.7.2] </ref>). Thus the relations (H2) can be verified in G by straightforward calculations using the corresponding relations for the untwisted group. <p> But Z lies inside G, so in fact it can be expressed in terms of generators for the Cartan subgroup of G, namely <ref> [Car72, 13.7.2] </ref> the elements h ff () for ff short (as noted above, these h ff (t) correspond to h r (t)h r ( t) in Carter's notation) and h ff ( ) for ff long (these h ff (t) correspond to those h r (t) which are contained in the <p> ff short, but for ff long we have (A 0 ) x ff (t; u)x ff (v; w) = x ff (t + v; u + w + * ff tv); hence [x ff (t; u); x ff (v; w)] = x ff (0; * ff ( tv tv)): (See <ref> [Car72, 13.6.4 (iv)] </ref>; the version in [Gri73] occasionally has * instead of our * ff .) The relations (B) for this case (G of type 2 A 2k (q)) are as follows: (B) [x ff (t); x fi (u)] = 1 for ff; fi short, ff + fi =2 x ff+fi <p> The fact that the relations (H2) hold in the twisted group G can be seen essentially as in Section 6.1. For ff long, our x ff (t; u) corresponds to x S (t; u) = x r (t)x r ( t)x r+r (u) in Carter's notation <ref> [Car72, 13.6.4 (iv)] </ref>, so its conjugate by h fi (w) has the form x ff (f (w)t; f 0 (w)u) for some functions f and f 0 .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A presentation of a group is a description by generators and relations which defines the group; we allow relations written as equations using powers of the generators. For general background and a number of specific presentations we refer to Coxeter and Moser <ref> [CM72] </ref>. We define the length of a presentation to be the total number of characters required to write all the relations. We write exponents in binary and include the number of digits in this count. <p> Example 1.1 takes care of cyclic groups G: their natural presentations have length fi (log jGj). A number of suitable presentations for the alternating groups G = A n are given in <ref> [CM72, Section 6.3] </ref>. All of them have length fi (n 2 ) = fi ((log jGj= log log jGj) 2 ). We quote a presentation contained in [Car23]. <p> We remark that the case q = p has attracted a lot of attention; a number of presentations of length O (log jGj) are listed in <ref> [CM72, Section 7.5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: G. Sunday [Sun72] found the following simple presentation (p is an odd prime): P SL (2; p) = hx; y : x p = y 2 = (xy) 3 = (x 4 yx (p+1)=2 y) 2 = 1i: Remark 7.3. More recently Campbell, Robertson, and Williams <ref> [CRW90] </ref> have found shorter presentations than Todd's and Sinkov's for P SL (2; p m ). Their presentations can be written so as to have length fi (log jGj) for all p and m (without needing to add generators as in Sinkov's presentation mentioned above). Remark 7.4.

Reference-contexts: Each Chevalley group G is associated with a finite field of order q and a parameter N (the number of "positive roots"). Steinberg uses 2N q generators. The Curtis-Steinberg-Tits presentation <ref> [Cur65] </ref> reduces this number somewhat, but its length is still proportional to q, not log q (cf. Section 4). This is not satisfactory from our point of view since log jGj is approximately 2N log q. <p> For convenience we treat these finitely many exceptions as sporadic groups (they cannot affect our asymptotic results) and exclude them in the following sections, because the Curtis-Steinberg-Tits presentation is known <ref> [Cur65] </ref> to describe a central extension of b G, which therefore must be b G if b G has trivial Schur multiplier. <p> The case G 2 (q) is described in detail in [Ste67, x10]. A subset of the above generators and relations will suffice for a presentation of G (see Remark 3.2), namely the Curtis-Steinberg-Tits presentation <ref> [Cur65] </ref>, which can be described as follows. <p> As in the untwisted case, we only need a subset of the above relations (by <ref> [Cur65] </ref>; see Remark 3.2), where we consider only roots ff 2 and, for (B), only pairs of roots (ff; fi) 2 , where the subsets and fi are defined as in Section 4. We then shorten this presentation essentially as in Sections 4.2 and 5.

Reference-contexts: Details of Steinberg's presentations for central extensions of the twisted simple groups can be found in <ref> [Gri73] </ref>. These presentations can be reduced in length, and supplemented to eliminate the center, in essentially the same way as was described in the previous sections. <p> Let n = 2k (k 2 since we are only considering rank 2 in this section). For many purposes the root system of this twisted group is best viewed as BC k , namely, the union of a B k and C k system. However, following Griess <ref> [Gri73] </ref> we will just use a C k system . 17 An additional complication in this case is that the root subgroups are not all abelian. <p> we have (A 0 ) x ff (t; u)x ff (v; w) = x ff (t + v; u + w + * ff tv); hence [x ff (t; u); x ff (v; w)] = x ff (0; * ff ( tv tv)): (See [Car72, 13.6.4 (iv)]; the version in <ref> [Gri73] </ref> occasionally has * instead of our * ff .) The relations (B) for this case (G of type 2 A 2k (q)) are as follows: (B) [x ff (t); x fi (u)] = 1 for ff; fi short, ff + fi =2 x ff+fi (* fffi tu) for ff; fi; <p> Let be the field automorphism such that 2 2 = 1 (i.e., t = t 2 e for t 2 GF (q)). The presentation from Griess <ref> [Gri73] </ref> for this group is the following: The generators are x ff (t) for each of the 16 roots ff, where t 2 GF (q). The relations (A) are of two sorts, depending on whether ff is short (odd numbered) or long (even numbered).

In all cases except G 2 (q), the terms in the product in (B) commute and thus their order does not matter. The case G 2 (q) is described in detail in [Ste67, x10]. A subset of the above generators and relations will suffice for a presentation of G (see Remark 3.2), namely the Curtis-Steinberg-Tits presentation [Cur65], which can be described as follows. <p> Example 4.1. <ref> [Ste67, p. 72] </ref> For n 3, the group SL (n; q) = A n1 (q) is defined in terms of the generators x ij (t) (1 i; j n, i 6= j, t 2 GF (q)) by the following relations x ij (t + u) = x ij (t)x ij (u); <p> Claim 4.3. is one-to-one on G 0 ( + ij ). Proof: Let ff i and ff j be the two fundamental roots in + ij . Then every member of + ij is a unique linear combination of ff i and ff j with nonnegative integer coefficients <ref> [Ste67, Appendix I, Prop. 9] </ref>. Order + ij in increasing order of the sum of these coefficients and extend this ordering to S. <p> Thus we let b - = -1 (1 - m), and our generators y ff (b -) will correspond to x ff ( -1 ). 5.1 O (log jGj) presentation For ff 2 and t 2 GF (q), t 6= 0, following <ref> [Ste67, p. 27] </ref> we let w ff (t) = y ff (t)y ff (t 1 )y ff (t) and (4) (Here again we implicitly use (A0) to expand y ff (t), etc.) Steinberg proves that h ff (tu) = h ff (t)h ff (u) (ff 2 ; t; u 2 GF <p> = y ff (t)y ff (t 1 )y ff (t) and (4) (Here again we implicitly use (A0) to expand y ff (t), etc.) Steinberg proves that h ff (tu) = h ff (t)h ff (u) (ff 2 ; t; u 2 GF (q) f0g) (6) follows from his relations <ref> [Ste67, p. 72, Theorem 9] </ref>, hence it follows from our reduced system of relations as well. Moreover, all of the h ff (t) commute; they generate a Cartan subgroup H of G. <p> Moreover, all of the h ff (t) commute; they generate a Cartan subgroup H of G. Furthermore, the relations h fi ()x ff (t)h fi () 1 = x ff ( 2 (ff;fi)=(fi;fi) t) (7) also hold in the Chevalley group <ref> [Ste67, p. 29, Lemma 20 (c)] </ref>, for any ff; fi 2 , not necessarily distinct (here (ff; fi) denotes the usual inner product of roots, so that 2 (ff; fi)=(fi; fi) is always an integer of absolute value 3). <p> This can be seen from the fact that it is the intersection of the (untwisted) subgroups of fixed points of a pure graph automorphism and a pure field automorphism (whereas the twisted group is only fixed by the composition of the graph and field automorphisms; cf. <ref> [Ste67, p. 171] </ref>). Alternatively, observe that restricting all scalars to GF (q) in the above Steinberg presentation for the twisted group produces the Steinberg presentation for the untwisted group with root system . Thus, all of the above relations hold in the twisted group G.

Reference-contexts: They fall in two categories: the normal and the twisted types. We shall refer to the former as Chevalley groups. Presentations for the groups of Lie type were first given by R. Steinberg <ref> [Ste62, Ste81] </ref> (cf. Sections 4 and 6 below). In Sections 3 to 5 we consider the case of Chevalley groups, postponing the discussion of the twisted types until Section 6. <p> Remark 3.2. In almost all cases the universal Chevalley group b G is the universal central extension of the simple group G, but there are a few cases where b G has non-trivial Schur multiplier <ref> [Ste81] </ref>. <p> )y ff (tu 1 u; u) and (11) where t; u 2 GF (q 2 ) with u + u = * ff t t as usual, and in (12) v can be taken as any element of GF (q 2 ) for which * ff vv = ~(t t) <ref> [Ste81, 5.3, 5.8 and 5.6] </ref>; in particular v = 0 if t 2 GF (q). <p> Their presentations can be written so as to have length fi (log jGj) for all p and m (without needing to add generators as in Sinkov's presentation mentioned above). Remark 7.4. We remark that Steinberg <ref> [Ste81] </ref> has also found presentations for the Lie type groups of rank 1 (including the twisted ones), but those presentations are of a different form than in the rank 2 case discussed in the previous sections (the commutator relations (B) do not arise since there is only one positive root). <p> Then a presentation for G can be obtained (cf. <ref> [Ste81, x4] </ref>) by starting with presentations for U and N , then giving the action of h on U , and finally giving all relations of the form w = uvu 0 with w 2 hhir, u; u 0 2 U , and v 2 r 1 U r (there are <p> action of h on U , and finally giving all relations of the form w = uvu 0 with w 2 hhir, u; u 0 2 U , and v 2 r 1 U r (there are jU j 1 such relations, exactly one for each nontrivial u 2 U <ref> [Ste81, Lemma 4.3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: We remark that the case q = p has attracted a lot of attention; a number of presentations of length O (log jGj) are listed in [CM72, Section 7.5]. Refining a presentation of Behr and Mennicke, J. G. Sunday <ref> [Sun72] </ref> found the following simple presentation (p is an odd prime): P SL (2; p) = hx; y : x p = y 2 = (xy) 3 = (x 4 yx (p+1)=2 y) 2 = 1i: Remark 7.3.

Reference-contexts: We shall see, however, that it is a relatively simple matter to reduce the presentation in terms of these generators, for groups of rank n 2. The rank 1 case, i.e., the groups P SL (2; q), was settled in <ref> [Tod36] </ref>. We will need some standard terminology involving Chevalley groups. Our main references are Steinberg's lecture notes [Ste67] and Carter's book [Car72]. Each Chevalley group G has a central extension b G called a universal Chevalley group. <p> Presentations for the groups G = P SL (2; q) were found by J. A. Todd <ref> [Tod36] </ref> using m + 2 generators (recall that q = p m ); the length of his presentation is fi (m log p + m 2 ) O (log 2 jGj).
