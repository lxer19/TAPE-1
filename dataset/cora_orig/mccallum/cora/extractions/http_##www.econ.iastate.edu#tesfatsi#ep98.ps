Abstract: This paper reports on computational experiments for an agent-based computational economics (ACE) model of a labor market with choice and refusal of contractual partners and endogenously evolving work-site behavior. Three types of labor market structures are examined: two-sided markets comprising workers and employers; partially fluid markets comprising pure workers, pure employers, and agents capable of functioning both as workers and as employers; and endogenous-type markets in which each agent is capable of functioning as both a worker and an employer. Particular attention is focused on experimentally determined correlations between market structure and the formation and evolution of contractual networks, and between contractual network formation and the types of work-site interactions and social welfare outcomes that these contractual networks support.

Reference-contexts: For such economies, then, there does not appear to be any central-tendency network in the sense defined in <ref> [2] </ref> but rather a number of different local basins of attraction. One possible explanation for these distinct distance clusters is that they correspond to multiple Nash equilibria for the underlying evolutionary match-and-play game in which the traders are participating.

Reference-contexts: The potential costs and benefits of alternative labor market institutions have also been investigated by means of analytical modelling. Indeed, an interesting theoretical literature stressing job search and matching in labor markets has flourished since the influential work by Diamond <ref> [3] </ref> on search equilibrium; see, for example, Aghion and Howitt [1]. Yet significant problems are encountered here as well.

Reference-contexts: A primary motivation for these studies has been the difficult restructuring issues faced by transition economies in Eastern Europe as well as the differential labor market experiences of the United States and Europe; see, for example, Nickell <ref> [7] </ref>. Unfortunately, these studies have been hindered by small sample sizes, and this problem has been compounded by the potential endogeneity of labor market institutions. Poor labor market outcomes may alter the selection of labor market institutions so that institutions and outcomes are jointly determined.

Reference-contexts: to understand how global economic regularities arise from the local interactions of autonomous agents channeled through socio-economic institutions rather than through fictitious coordinating mechanisms such as imposed equilibrium conditions. 2 The ACE model of a labor market developed in this study builds on the Trade Network Game developed by Tesfatsion <ref> [9] </ref> for studying the formation and evolution of trade networks under alternatively specified market structures. <p> More concretely, in all of the labor market experiments reported here, the DCR mechanism described in Section 2 is used to match workers and employers. The matching outcomes generated via the DCR mechanism have been shown (Tesfatsion <ref> [9] </ref>) to have the usual optimality properties associated with Gale-Shapley type matching mechanisms: namely, pairwise stability; and Pareto optimality from the vantage point of workers, the agents who actively make offers.

Reference-contexts: Roughly defined, ACE is the computational study of economies modelled as evolving decentralized systems of autonomous interacting agents. ACE is thus a specialization to economics of the basic artificial life paradigm (Tesfatsion <ref> [10] </ref>).
