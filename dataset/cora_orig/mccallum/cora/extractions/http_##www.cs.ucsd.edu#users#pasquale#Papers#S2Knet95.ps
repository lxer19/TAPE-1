Abstract: In this report, we present a plan for upgrading the Sequoia 2000 network, a wide-area network connecting five UC campuses operating at tens of megabits per second, to gigabit per second speeds. We present our motivation for a gigabit network by describing the new direction of the Sequoia project, now called Redwood, and describing the applications that drive our decisions for upgrading the network. The plan describes the equipment we have researched as being the best choices and our rationale behind these decisions. Where we need help from CNRI is in obtaining the required bandwidths from some bandwidth provider. The Sequoia 2000 project is a collaboration of computer scientists and Earth scientists at the University of California, whose goal is to design, build, and put into practical use a distributed information system that effectively supports intensive computational and storage requirements, such as those evidenced by Earth science applications [1]. In addition, the system is to provide tools that support collaboration among distributed teams of scientists. Sequoia Gigabit Network Plan: Final Report

Reference-contexts: The Sequoia project focused on four technology areas: databases, networking, storage, and visualization. The project made significant contributions, most notably in how very large data objects (tens of megabytes to hundreds of gigabytes) are queried and searched <ref> [2] </ref>, communicated between processes within a computer and between computers over a network [3], and visualized and animated with a high degree of user interaction [4]. In addition (and perhaps most important), these advances have been incorporated in working systems that are helping Earth scientists do their science more effectively.

Reference-contexts: Phase II is now in the planning stages, and is titled Redwood <ref> [5] </ref>. Fast wide-area networking is the cornerstone of Redwood. The requirement for a fast network is based on our experiences in the Sequoia project. Con sequently, it is worth describing some of the more important experiences. 1.1 Sequoia Applications Sequoia is an Earth science application-driven project. <p> Page 8 2.0 Sequoia Phase II: Redwood The goal of the Redwood project to design, build, and put into practical use an advanced distributed computing environment that supports a wide range of collaborative enterprises <ref> [5] </ref>. These enterprises may be related to academic activity, such as scientific research involving distributed teams of researchers, or may be related to business, such as virtual corporations.
