Abstract: To navigate effectively, an autonomous agent must be able to quickly and accurately determine its current location. Given an initial estimate of its position (per-haps based on dead-reckoning) and an image taken of a known environment, our agent first attempts to locate a set of landmarks (real-world objects at known locations), then uses their angular separation to obtain an improved estimate of its current position. Unfortunately, some landmarks may not be visible, or worse, may be confused with other landmarks, resulting in both time wasted in searching for invisible landmarks, and in further errors in the agent's estimate of its position. To address these problems, we propose a method that uses previous experiences to learn a selection function that, given the set of landmarks that might be visible, returns the subset which can reliably be found correctly, and so provide an accurate registration of the agent's position. We use statistical techniques to prove that the learned selection function is, with high probability, effectively at a local optimal in the space of such functions. This report also presents empirical evidence, using real-world data, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 (from <ref> (Greiner & Isukapalli 1994) </ref>) The LearnSF ( Sel 1 ; *; ffi ) process incrementally produces a series of selection functions Sel 1 ; Sel 2 ; : : : ; Sel m , such that each Sel j+1 = t j (Sel j ) for some t j 2 T <p> All of these results are reported, in detail, in <ref> (Greiner & Isukapalli 1994) </ref>. Summary of Empirical Results: The first obvious conclusion is that selection functions are useful; notice in particular that the landmarks they returned enabled R to obtain fairly good positional estimates | within a few tenths of a meter.

Reference-contexts: It will find a subset of these landmarks, each at some angle (relative to a reference landmark). Locate then uses simple geometric reasoning to obtain a set of new estimates of R's position; perhaps one from each set of three found landmarks (Hancock & Judd 1994), or see <ref> (Gurvits & Betke 1994) </ref>. After removing the obvious outliers, Locate returns the centroid of the remaining estimates as its positional-estimate for R, and the variance of these estimates as the measure of uncertainty; see (Hancock & Judd 1993).

Reference-contexts: To instantiate these processes: In the current Rat-BOT system <ref> (Hancock & Judd 1993) </ref>, the LMs process uses a comprehensive "landmark-description" of the environment, which is a complete list of all of the objects in that environment that could be visible, together with their respective positions. <p> After removing the obvious outliers, Locate returns the centroid of the remaining estimates as its positional-estimate for R, and the variance of these estimates as the measure of uncertainty; see <ref> (Hancock & Judd 1993) </ref>. <p> claims that a good selection function can help an autonomous agent to register its position efficiently and accurately, and also that LearnSF can help find such good selection functions, we implemented various selection functions and the LearnSF learning algorithm, and incorporated them within the implemented autonomous agent, RatBOT, described in <ref> (Hancock & Judd 1993) </ref>. This section describes our empirical results. We first took a set of 270 "pictures" at known locations within three halls of our building.

Reference-contexts: N.b., we assume that this set of all possible landmarks is known initially; this contrasts with other systems that also attempt to learn the set of landmarks from the observations; cf., <ref> (Kuipers & Byun 1988) </ref> and others. 2 Another possible complication is that R may identify a wide landmark correctly, but mistakenly refer to the wrong position within that landmark.
