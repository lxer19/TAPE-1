Reference-contexts: The shape drawn on paper is the same, but the conceptualization of it in our mind is very different. The conceptual pieces into which a letter is broken in the mind's eye are its roles. (See <ref> [Blesser, 1973] </ref>.) For example, the two crossing slashes in an imagined `x' are roles. So also are their four tips, and the crossing-point in the middle. Each role has a different degree of importance to the letter | the degree to which its presence or absence matters.

Reference-contexts: Different types of codelets affect each of the four global memories according to their particular activities. The history of the codelet-based architecture is relevant here. Early inspiration for the Letter Spirit architecture came from a model of low-level and high-level auditory perception | the Hearsay II speech-understanding project <ref> [Erman et al., 1980] </ref>. Hearsay II modeled the way in which low-level auditory input signals are converted to meaningful utterances, and pioneered in developing a parallel architecture in which bottom-up and top-down processes coexist and cooperate gracefully.

Reference-contexts: It made use of a Blackboard system that integrated information from a variety of processing levels. The three main predecessors of Letter Spirit are Jumbo [Hofstadter, 1983], Copycat 3 [Mitchell, 1990], and Tabletop <ref> [French, 1992] </ref>. The Letter Spirit architecture is closely related to their architectures. Copycat and Tabletop solve analogy problems in microdomains using psychologically plausible methods. Both are models of high-level perception making use of a novel type of architecture that falls somewhere between the symbolic and connectionist paradigms.

Reference-contexts: and TALE-SPIN, which attempt to construct large coherent pieces of work, are exceptions. 8.1 Typeface creation by the GridFont network Grebert and colleagues, inspired by the Letter Spirit domain and the creation task of Letter Spirit, decided to try a purely connectionist approach and see how well it could do <ref> [Grebert et al., 1991a] </ref>. 4 Their model is based on what they call "generalizing production from examples" using a three-layer feedforward network that is supposed to learn how to create gridfonts by being trained on a few examples.

Reference-contexts: Given an `a' in a certain style, how would you make an `e' in the same style? Of course the problem here is figuring out what "the same style" means. Transferring stylistic aspects from one letter to another involves the sort of "slippability" discussed in <ref> [Hofstadter, 1979] </ref>, [Hofstadter, 1987a], [Hofstadter and Mitchell, 1991], and [Mitchell, 1993]. Stylistic qualities of one letter cannot usually be directly transferred to another; rather, they must be "slipped" into reasonable variants so that they fit within the conceptual framework of the new letter without bending it beyond recognition.

Reference-contexts: The specifics of this will be shown in Section 3. Although much work has been done on character recognition and the reading of handwriting, AI has had 3 little to say about letter-concepts <ref> [Hofstadter, 1985a] </ref>. So far, attempts at letter recognition and creation in AI have mostly been based on the notion that letters are basically syntactic variants of a single underlying shape.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, letterforms are restricted to short line segments on a fixed grid having 21 points arranged in a 3 fi 7 array <ref> [Hofstadter, 1985b] </ref>. Legal line segments, called quanta, are those that connect any point to any of its nearest neighbors horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. There are 56 possible quanta on the grid, as shown in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: For more see <ref> [Hofstadter, 1987b] </ref>. 5 Since it is impossible to make tiny changes on the grid, any two instantiations of a given letter are significantly different from each other.

Reference-contexts: Probabilistic selection based on urgencies allows this to happen. The parallel terraced scan can be thought of as allocating processing power as a function of the degree of promise of a pathway. This idea has much in common with genetic algorithm search and the k-armed bandit problem <ref> [Holland et al., 1986] </ref>. New codelets are created in two ways: (1) they are posted as follow-ups to codelets that complete their tasks; (2) they are placed on the Coderack automatically as certain stages of processing are reached. The population of the Coderack thus dynamically adjusts to the system's needs.

Reference-contexts: However, Letter Spirit is also an AI program. Even if its cognitive mechanisms turned out to be very different from human mechanisms, Letter Spirit would still be interesting as an approach to machine creativity. Traditional AI has often been criticized for its brittleness <ref> [Holland, 1986] </ref>, which could be considered the antithesis of creativity. New types of mechanisms are thus needed if AI is to successfully model creativity (along with a host of other human activities that require intelligence).

Reference-contexts: It seems to us fair to say that this kind of emergent, unpredictable processing constitutes a program's making its own decisions. This concurs with the views expressed in <ref> [Johnson-Laird, 1988] </ref> that free will and creativity are closely related. 7 The Implementation of Emergent Processing We now descend one level further into the implementation details of Letter Spirit.

The approach most relevant to the Examiner and Adjudicator is known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR involves converting documents printed in a variety of fonts into machine-readable form.

Reference-contexts: Many such approaches have obvious flaws. As the field has progressed, ideas about creativity have developed accordingly. Below are listed some of the main attempts to model the creative process: * Meehan's TALE-SPIN program generated stories using a knowledge-based approach <ref> [Meehan, 1976] </ref>. It made up sensible stories with the aid of a planner, but in the process sacrificed flexibility and interest. Since TALE-SPIN had no idea what made a story entertaining, stories ended up being rather dull and brittle.

Reference-contexts: It is often convenient to speak as if these emergent activities were carried out by four explicit and cleanly separable modules, together comprising the totality of the program. (These agents could be likened to the agents referred to in <ref> [Minsky, 1985] </ref>.) The names we shall apply to these hypothetical modules or agents are, respectively, the Imaginer, the Drafter, the Examiner, and the Adjudicator, and we shall briefly describe each of them in turn.

Reference-contexts: It made use of a Blackboard system that integrated information from a variety of processing levels. The three main predecessors of Letter Spirit are Jumbo [Hofstadter, 1983], Copycat 3 <ref> [Mitchell, 1990] </ref>, and Tabletop [French, 1992]. The Letter Spirit architecture is closely related to their architectures. Copycat and Tabletop solve analogy problems in microdomains using psychologically plausible methods.

Reference-contexts: Transferring stylistic aspects from one letter to another involves the sort of "slippability" discussed in [Hofstadter, 1979], [Hofstadter, 1987a], [Hofstadter and Mitchell, 1991], and <ref> [Mitchell, 1993] </ref>. Stylistic qualities of one letter cannot usually be directly transferred to another; rather, they must be "slipped" into reasonable variants so that they fit within the conceptual framework of the new letter without bending it beyond recognition.

Reference-contexts: These gaps are both serious defects in anything that purports to be a model of creativity. In this connection, a quintessential (though little-known) example is the DAFFODIL project <ref> [Nanard et al., 1986] </ref>. Many people, if they knew about DAFFODIL, would undoubtedly suggest it as a program that has already achieved our stated goals. To show why this is a serious misconception, we must briefly describe the project.

Reference-contexts: and a set of heuristics for drawing, the program creates a picture plan, but that plan is never perceived or judged (either before or after it has been realized). * Perhaps the model closest in heart to Letter Spirit is the GENESIS system developed by Jon Rowe and Derek Partridge <ref> [Rowe and Partridge, 1991a] </ref>. The GENESIS program, which plays the card game micro-Eleusis, recognizes the need for flexible representation and control. Their work, like Letter Spirit, stresses the importance of emergence and the interaction of autonomous agents in modeling creativity.
