Reference-contexts: Gould (1991) claims that in order to explain such radical changes one should abandon the adaptationist or "ultra-Darwinist" paradigm. The idea that all change is gradual and continuous is in fact a consequence of interpreting phenotypic changes as mostly adaptations. Gould <ref> (see also Gould and Vrba, 1982) </ref> proposed to classify phenotypic traits in three different categories: adaptations (traits that have a well-defined function), preadaptations (traits built for one function and then adapted to another), and exaptations (traits not built as adaptations at all but later adapted for some function) and he claims

Since most mutations do not affect fitness and, this notwithstanding, may be maintained in the population, this implies that evolution is to a significant extent neutral. In other words, changes occur in the population and are retained in successive generations which are not adaptive in the sense that they do not increase fitness. Insofar as these changes determine the future course of evolution, these changes are selectively neutral. </title>

Reference-contexts: To each O corresponds a string of genetic material or genotype which specifies a set of developmental instructions. These instructions generate a certain number of neurons and control the growth and branching process of the axons of the neurons <ref> (Nolfi and Parisi, 1992) </ref>. The result of this growing process is a neural network that represents the nervous system of the corresponding O. The inherited architecture and connection weights of such a network determine the way in which O responds to environmental stimuli (the behavior of the network). <p> Os are placed in individual copies in the environment (i.e. they live in isolation) and they do not change during the course of their life. In other words, the development of the nervous system is supposed to be instantaneous. <ref> (For a different approach see Nolfi and Parisi, 1992) </ref>. Fitness is calculated by counting +10 points for each cycle spent in the target area, +1 point for each movement forward, and -1 point for each cycle spent outside the 20x20 cell area.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, only the way in which an O reacts to a given (self-selected) subset of all potential input stimuli has a role in determining O's fitness <ref> (Nolfi and Parisi, 1993) </ref>. shows the reactions of this O in all the world cells for each of the four possible directions.

Reference-contexts: The way in which an O reacts to all possible input stimuli is O's potential behavior while the way in which the O reacts to the stimuli it actually experiences during its life is O's actual behavior. In ecological networks <ref> (cf. Parisi, Cecconi, and Nolfi, 1990) </ref> the stimuli an O experiences during its life are partially determined by O itself through its motor behavior. (Figure 7 shows how a typical O actually visits most of the world's cells in some of the four possible directions only).
