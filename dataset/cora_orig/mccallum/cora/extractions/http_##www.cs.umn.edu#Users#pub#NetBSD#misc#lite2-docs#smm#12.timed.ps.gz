Reference-contexts: Introduction The Time Synchronization Protocol (TSP) has been designed for specific use by the program timed, a local area network clock synchronizer for the UNIX 4.3BSD operating system. Timed is built on the DARPA UDP protocol <ref> [4] </ref> and is based on a master slave scheme. TSP serves a dual purpose. First, it supports messages for the synchronization of the clocks of the various hosts in a local area network.

Reference-contexts: The present implementation keeps processor clocks synchronized within 20 milliseconds. A master time daemon measures the time difference between the clock of the machine on which it is running and those of all other machines. The current implementation uses ICMP Time Stamp Requests <ref> [5] </ref> to measure the clock difference between machines. The master computes the network time as the average of the times provided by nonfaulty clocks. 1 It then sends to each slave time daemon the correction that should be performed on the clock of its machine. This process is repeated periodically.
