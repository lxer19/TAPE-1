Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as work in progress. To learn the current status of any Internet-Draft, please check the 1id-abstracts.txt listing contained in the Internet-Drafts Shadow Directories on ftp.is.co.za (Africa), nic.nordu.net (Europe), munnari.oz.au (Pacific Rim), ds.internic.net (US East Coast), or ftp.isi.edu (US West Coast). Abstract A large number of the services we wish to make possible for Internet telephony require fairly elaborate combinations of signalling operations, often in network devices, to complete. We want a simple and standardized way to create such services to make them easier to implement and deploy. This document describes an architecture for such a method, which we call a call processing language. It also outlines requirements for such a language.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, several protocols have been created to allow telephone calls to be made over IP networks, notably SIP <ref> [1] </ref> and H.323 [2]. These emerging standards have opened up the possibility of a broad and dramatic decentralization of the provisioning of telephone services so they can be under the user's control. Many of these services may reside on end devices. <p> Redirect servers tell the originating location an alternate location to try. Registrars track users' current locations; they will usually be the same devices as proxy or redirect servers, but do not necessarily have to be. See the illustrations in <ref> [1] </ref>. End systems may also have some properties of network systems, most likely the ability to perform redirection. 3.2 Model of normal use Internet telephony addresses can be divided into two broad categories: terminal addresses and permanent user addresses.

Reference-contexts: See the next section for some implications of this. 3.6 Feature interaction behavior Feature interaction is the term used in telephony systems when two or more requested features produce ambiguous or conflicting behavior <ref> [3] </ref>. Feature interaction issues for features implemented with a call processing language can be roughly divided into three categories: feature-to-feature in one server, script-to-script in one server, and server-to-server. <p> As an aside, <ref> [3] </ref> discusses a fourth type of feature interaction for traditional telephone networks, signalling ambiguity.
