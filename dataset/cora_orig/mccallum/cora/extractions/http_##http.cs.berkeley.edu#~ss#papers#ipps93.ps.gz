Reference-contexts: To do so, we compare read and write performance of RAID-II, which has a parity engine, to the read and write performance of our first prototype, RAID-I, which has no parity engine and must use its Sun4 file server to compute parity <ref> [Chervenak91] </ref>. Both RAID-II and RAID-I tests use the same number of memory transfers. 7 Table 2 shows RAID-II full-stripe writes [Lee91] are only 13% slower than reads, where RAID-I full-stripe writes are 50% slower than reads. <p> had simply connected the HIPPI to the Sun4s VME bus instead of to the XBUS card, RAID-IIs performance would have been comparable to RAID-Is performance, because RAID-Is performance is limited by the speed of its memory bus, so using more disks and a fast network would not have increased performance <ref> [Chervenak91] </ref>. 4 Conclusions In this paper, we have evaluated the performance of RAID-II, a network-attached storage server. We have demonstrated end-to-end system performance of 20 MB/s for both disk array reads and writes. We have also examined four major design issues in the design of RAID-II.
