Abstract: This paper is concerned with the learning of basic behaviors in autonomous robots. In this way, we present a method for the adaptation of basic reactive behaviors implemented as fuzzy controllers applying a genetic algorithm to the evolution of the fuzzy rule system. In this sense, we show our experiments in the evolution of control rules based on symbolic concepts represented as linguistic labels. The rules will be formulated in a fuzzy way and in order to test the rules obtained in each generation of the genetic algorithm a real robot has been used. The individual with the best performance is chosen to generate a new population: the elite strategy. All the new individuals were tested in the same real environment. In conclusion, the individuals of the last generation offer a set of rules that provides better performance than the ones designed by a non-expert designer.

Reference-contexts: This is caused by the differences among sensors due to the differences in the manufacturing process. 3 Adaptation of Fuzzy Behaviors Some works can be bou about the use of genetic methods to learn plans for autonomous, for instance in <ref> (Cook, 1993) </ref> a genetic method to formulate new sets of low-level decision rules for robot movements and pushing techniques. Each rule checks to see that certain conditions are true (obstacles detected, goal position, etc.), and executes a number of corresponding operators (move forward, move backward, turn left or turn right).

Reference-contexts: Finally, some works have been proposed in the evolution of fuzzy controllers applying to the control of autonomous vehicles. For instance, in <ref> (Cooper, 1995) </ref> a general method for the evolution of rule-based fuzzy controllers in presented. Another methodology based in a hierarchical prioritized structure using a messy genetic algorithm is applied to the control of an autonomous vehicle, (Hoffmann and Pfister, 1994).

Reference-contexts: Some works have also been made in the genetic evolution of fuzzy rules. For instance, in (Thrift, 1993) a genetic algorithm for the design of the fuzzy rules is presented to center a cart by applying a single force. Another example appears in <ref> (Karr, 1991) </ref> where the application of this method to three different physical systems is presented: a liquid-level system, a pH system and a satellite-rendezvous system. In each of these applications the genetically designed fuzzy controllers outperforms the human designed ones.

Reference-contexts: It is a hierarchy of layers, each one working asynchronously with its own level of data abstraction, in which the navigation module consists of a reactive module based on fuzzy logic. Another classical example of an autonomous system controlled using fuzzy behaviors is <ref> (Pin and Watanabe, 1993) </ref>. This system consists of a car which navigates autonomously thanks to a group of fuzzy rules sets. In order to present the learning mechanism used to adapt the fuzzy control rules, we introduce in a first subsection the basic concepts of the fuzzy logic controllers.

Reference-contexts: The third section deals with the description of our experiment. In the fourth section the result of these experiments is discussed and our future work is presented. 2 Problem Description Fuzzy controllers have been widely used for controlling different autonomous robots. For instance, in <ref> (Reignier, 1994) </ref> the LIFIA architecture is presented. It is a hierarchy of layers, each one working asynchronously with its own level of data abstraction, in which the navigation module consists of a reactive module based on fuzzy logic.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Artificial Life has been defined as "a scientific discipline that studies how behavior of agent emerges and becomes intelligent and adaptative" <ref> (Steels, 1994) </ref>. Many experiments have been made using neural networks, finite state machines, etc. showing how these behaviors can emerge. However, artificial life community has not been very concerned about the emergence of symbolic concepts.

Reference-contexts: To better cope with the intrinsic uncertainty that underlies the appearance of perceptual inputs (distorted after the acquisition process), the numerical values of the distances d i can be mapped into qualitative symbolic labels through a fuzzification process <ref> (Zadeh, 1973) </ref>, transforming the computed distances into linguistic variables. A linguistic variable (Zadeh, 1973) is a variable whose values are sentences in a natural or artificial language, that is, a concatenation of atomic terms: labels (adjetives), hedges (modifiers such as very, much, slightly, etc.), the negation and makers (parentheses). <p> To better cope with the intrinsic uncertainty that underlies the appearance of perceptual inputs (distorted after the acquisition process), the numerical values of the distances d i can be mapped into qualitative symbolic labels through a fuzzification process <ref> (Zadeh, 1973) </ref>, transforming the computed distances into linguistic variables.

The compositional rule of inference (CRI) proposed by <ref> (Zadeh, 1973) </ref>, (approximate extension of the familiar rule of modus ponens), serves as inference mechanism to obtain the fuzzy subset induced in M OT by a fuzzy statement of the form (Ld i is ld ir ) through each conditional statement of the FRA. <p> That is the fuzzy subset of M OT whose membership function is obtained after max min product of discretized versions of ld ir (d i ) and ld ij (d i ) fi ls k (d i ; s), represented as (relational) matrices <ref> (Zadeh, 1973) </ref>. As there can be several conditional statements forming the FRA, the meaning of LM OT will be the intersection of the intermediate meanings resulting from each application of the CRI (min of all the induced consequent membership functions).
