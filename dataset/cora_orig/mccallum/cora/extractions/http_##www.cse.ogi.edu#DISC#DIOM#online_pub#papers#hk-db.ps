Abstract: In the modern Internet environment, various types of data sources have become accessible, including multimedia data and web pages. Some of the fundamental assumptions in traditional databases, such as the existence of a global schema and data consistency maintained by a Data Base Administrator, are no longer true in many of the new data sources. We outline the DIOM [LP95b] object-oriented approach to build interoperable heterogeneous information systems despite the absence of global schema and the presence of data inconsistency. We describe the metadata catalog management component of DIOM, a key service in the support for interoperation among heterogeneous information sources. To support a flexible and customizable conection between information consumers and information producers, DIOM metadata catalog development utilizes the adaptive specification mechanisms, provided in DIOM interface description language, for explicit description of information consumers' domain query requirements and for object-oriented abstractions of information producers' information sources.

Distributed Interoperable Object Model (DIOM) is developed mainly for incorporating system-wide scalability and evolution support as well as component composability into an interoperation framework.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, atomic transactions [GR93] depend on data consistency assumption, since they are defined as programs that take a database from a consistent state to another consistent state. In the current generation of new information systems (or so called non-traditional database systems (NDBs) such as scientific data <ref> [BP93] </ref>, multimedia databases, a variety of Internet data sources [LP95b], some of these important assumptions do not hold and classic database techniques may not apply directly. <p> In contrast, other inconsistencies depend on statistical and probabilistic models, such as the error bars in scientific data <ref> [BP93] </ref>. Analogously, in addition to value inconsistency, there is a time dimension to most data [PTWY94]. For example, even if we do not know the current value of a data item, knowing the last update time may be helpful. Another example of inconsistency involves the issues known as data quality.

Reference-contexts: DIOM consists of an interface description language (IDL) and an interface query language (IQL). Rather than inventing yet another object oriented data model, DIOM adopts the ODMG-IDL and ODMG-OQL object database standard <ref> [Cea94, Kim94] </ref> as the base model and adds a number of interface abstractions to allow new interfaces to be constructed in terms of existing ones, and to provide better support for the USECA properties. These incremental interface construction facilities include: import mechanism, interface aggregation, interface generalization, and interface specialization.

Reference-contexts: Information consumers may query the information from multiple heterogeneous information sources through a unified object-oriented view in terms of IDL, and executes requests (e.g., queries, updates on object links, and method invocations) at the relevant information sources. Diorama's components conform to client/server standards such as CORBA <ref> [For93] </ref> and are dynamically bound to individual information sources to support independent component evolution. For instance, DIOM interfaces to C++ applications may be a set of C++ classes that act as "surrogates" for the corresponding definition of the DIOM interface schema.

Reference-contexts: For example, a relational database is described completely by the database schema, and data/schema consistency is maintained by the Data Base Administrator (DBA). Query processors and optimizers use database schema in critical ways. Similarly, atomic transactions <ref> [GR93] </ref> depend on data consistency assumption, since they are defined as programs that take a database from a consistent state to another consistent state.

Reference-contexts: In the current generation of new information systems (or so called non-traditional database systems (NDBs) such as scientific data [BP93], multimedia databases, a variety of Internet data sources <ref> [LP95b] </ref>, some of these important assumptions do not hold and classic database techniques may not apply directly. In this paper, we examine two decreasingly valid assumptions in nontraditional databases that strive to be interoperable: (1) data is consistent in the database, and (2) database schema is reasonably stable. <p> We restrict our attention to these two assumptions due to the complexity of the issue. We acknowledge the importance of other traditional database assumptions and anticipate much more work to be done in this direction. We have proposed the Distributed Interoperable Object Model (DIOM) <ref> [LP95b] </ref> to address the problem of data inconsistency and dynamic system evolution in the integration of heterogeneous information sources. The main idea of DIOM is to define interoperability as a flexible and voluntary interfacing of heterogeneous information consumers and information producers. <p> We have captured the requirements of these large-scale interoperable systems by USECA properties <ref> [LP95b] </ref> Uniform access to heterogeneous information sources, Scalability to the growing number of information sources, Evolution and Composability of software and information sources, and Autonomy of participants, both information consumers and information producers. DIOM consists of an interface description language (IDL) and an interface query language (IQL). <p> In the following section we discuss how we construct and maintain the distributed metadata catalog in DIOM and what roles the metadata catalog management play in each phase of the DIOM query mediation process and in supporting USECA properties within the DIOM interoperation architecture <ref> [LP95b] </ref>. Examples are provided to highlight the benefits of object-orientated approach to the design of DIOM interface description language.

Reference-contexts: Other times, these uncertainties are considered part of the sensor description (e.g., model number and brand of an electronic microscope for digital images), or included in the metadata, as part of experimental setup description (e.g., in a Crystallographic Information File description of protein structures <ref> [NSF93] </ref>). To complicate matters, the inconsistency may take several forms or contain several dimensions. For example, some inconsistencies are given by absolute bounds [RP95], as in bank accounts that allow limited withdrawals from Automatic Teller Machines, where the inconsistency is bounded by the daily cash withdrawal limit.

Reference-contexts: The investigation of which traditional techniques still apply under the relaxation of a particular set of assumptions become an increasingly challenging area for research and development.
