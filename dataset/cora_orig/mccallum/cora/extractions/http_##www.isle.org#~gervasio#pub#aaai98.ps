Abstract: Mixed-initiative systems present the challenge of finding an effective level of interaction between humans and computers. Machine learning presents a promising approach to this problem in the form of systems that automatically adapt their behavior to accommodate different users. In this paper, we present an empirical study of learning user models in an adaptive assistant for crisis scheduling. We describe the problem domain and the scheduling assistant, then present an initial formulation of the adaptive assistant's learning task and the results of a baseline study. After this, we report the results of three subsequent experiments that investigate the effects of problem reformulation and representation augmentation. The results suggest that problem reformulation leads to significantly better accuracy without sacrificing the usefulness of the learned behavior. The studies also raise several interesting issues in adaptive assistance for scheduling.

Reference-contexts: Some recent AI scheduling systems (e.g., Smith et al., 1996; Fukunaga et al., 1997) have mixed-initiative modes, but few incorporate learning or adaptation to different users. The same holds for AI crisis response systems such as O-Plan2 (Tate et al., 1994) and SOCAP <ref> (Bienkowski, 1996) </ref>. An exception is CABINS (Miyashita & Sycara, 1995), an assistant for job-shop scheduling that learns user preferences on repair heuristics. Like Inca, CABINS acquires preferences from user traces and uses these to direct a repair-space search for a solution.

Reference-contexts: Each scheduling operation performed while solving a problem corresponds to a training or test instance. From traces of the first and second users, we extracted 935 examples (data set A) and 1049 examples (data set B) respectively. Nearly all fielded applications of machine learning <ref> (Langley & Simon, 1995) </ref> rely on attribute-value representations and standard supervised induction methods, so we decided to investigate the feasibility of such an approach here. This has the advantage of either avoiding the cost of engineering a special-purpose approach Table 1: Percentage accuracy in predicting user opera- tions during scheduling.

Reference-contexts: We can thus state the learning task as: Given a set of training examples, learn a classifier that makes correct predictions on new examples. Preliminary studies with supervised learning algorithms from the repository maintained by the Machine Learning Group at the University of Texas at Austin revealed ID3 <ref> (Quinlan, 1986) </ref> to be the most promising, so we chose to use this in our formal experiments. 1 We had two hypotheses for the baseline experiment.
