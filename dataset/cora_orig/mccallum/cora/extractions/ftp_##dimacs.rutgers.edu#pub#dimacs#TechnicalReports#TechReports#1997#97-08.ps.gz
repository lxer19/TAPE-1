Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The aim of this and our previous work <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, with S. Janowsky, is the determination of the underlying microscopic structure of a fluid in regions in which it has shocks on the macroscopic scale. <p> It can be shown [13] (see also [14, 15], and <ref> [1] </ref> for a heuristic argument) that the velocity of the second class particle in a uniform environment of first class particles at density is (p q)(1 2), so that far to the left of the shock the second class particle moves at a velocity (p q)(1 2 ), faster than the <p> In the present paper we describe exactly this invariant measure. Our approach is an extension of a matrix method which has been used in a number of situations [22]-[33], in which the weight of each configuration is written as the matrix element of a matrix product. As in <ref> [1] </ref>, there are three possibilities for each matrix in the product, D; A and E, depending on whether the corresponding site is occupied by a first class particle, occupied by a second class particle, or is empty. <p> We will often express our results in terms of + ; ; p and q through the parameters x = p 2. The algebra for the partially asymmetric shock measure In analogy with <ref> [1, 22] </ref> we write the probability of a configuration specified by the occupation numbers t i (t i = 0; 1) of m consecutive sites to the left of the second class particle (which is located at the origin) and n consecutive sites to its right as a matrix element of <p> is located at the origin) and n consecutive sites to its right as a matrix element of the form hwj &lt; 1 Y [t i D + (1 t i )E] = A &lt; n Y [t j D + (1 t j )E] = jvi: (2.1) Here, as in <ref> [1] </ref>, a first class particle is represented by a matrix D, a hole by a matrix E, and the second class particle by a matrix A. <p> the second class particle, that is, of the configuration 1 0 1 2 0 1 1 0 0 ; (2.2) is given by hwj D E D A E D 2 E 2 jvi: (2.3) In Appendix A we show, by an extension of the proof which was given in <ref> [1] </ref>, that if the matrices D, E and A and the vectors hwj and jvi satisfy certain algebraic conditions then the weights (2.1) are nonnegative and define an invariant measure for the ASEP, as seen from a single second class particle, with dynamics specified by (1.2). <p> position n, is given to the right of the second class particle by - 4 - and to the left of the second class particle by ht n i = hwjD (D + E) n1 Ajvi; n 1: (2.11) In contrast to the approach to the shock problem taken in <ref> [1] </ref>, expressions like (2.10) and (2.11) are valid directly for the infinite system; thus here we avoid completely the difficulty of taking the infinite volume limit. <p> We note that, in contrast with the totally asymmetric case x = 0, discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>, there are - 5 - in general correlations between the left and the right of the second class particle. The expressions in (2.13) are symmetric polynomial functions of + and . The symmetry follows from (2.4)-(2.6), but we could not derive it by an elementary argument from the dynamics. <p> When x = 0, (6.8) becomes Z = ( a b) 2 leading to ht n i + ' 2 ( a b) 2 n 3=2 [1 ( a b) 2 ] n+ 1 This agrees with (6.26) of <ref> [1] </ref> (and with (7.6) of that paper after the correction of a misprint: the exponent 2i 1 should be 2i + 1). By a modification of the above calculation one may also find the asymptotics when + = . The result is independent of x and is that given in [1]: <p> <ref> [1] </ref> (and with (7.6) of that paper after the correction of a misprint: the exponent 2i 1 should be 2i + 1). By a modification of the above calculation one may also find the asymptotics when + = . The result is independent of x and is that given in [1]: ht n i ' + q when n 1, where = + = . <p> The results, which hold for all p &gt; 1=2, generalize those of <ref> [1] </ref>, in which such measures were obtained for the fully asymmetric case p = 1. Our derivation, in contrast to that of previous works, is carried out directly in the infinite system. <p> Thus (B.8) holds if g is a polynomial and hence, by a uniform approximation argument, if g is continuous on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> K .

Reference-contexts: the motion of the shock. (For example, one may wonder how an elementary move at the microscopic level|a single jump of a particle to one of its neighboring sites|affects the position of the shock.) There are, however, several ways of defining the position of the shock at the microscopic level <ref> [11] </ref>; a standard method [12], which we use in the present paper, is to introduce a single second class particle into the system. <p> The microscopic shock profile derived in this work contains both intrinsic features of the shock and the fluctuations of the position of the second class particle. One can imagine many other ways of locating the shock <ref> [11] </ref>; with an alternate definition, the expression for the profile would certainly be different. However, one expects that there exist intrinsic properties of the shock which are independent of the definition of its location. <p> expectation values vanish in the asymptotic Bernoulli measures with densitites + and , e.g., i=1 We have evaluated explicitly such sums for the totally asymmetric case p = 1, using the invariant measure as seen from the second class particle, and will report on this work in a later publication <ref> [11] </ref>. One consequence is a new derivation of identities such as (3.4), using the fact that the second class particle can be considered, in the sum, as either a first class particle or a hole. Acknowledgments We are grateful to Errico Presutti for helpful discussions.

Reference-contexts: By an argument similar to that of Sandow <ref> [23] </ref> we may verify that (2.4)-(2.9) suffice to determine any matrix element containing precisely one factor of A. To do so we will show that any matrix element of a product of n + 1 operators can be reduced to a sum of matrix elements of products of n operators. <p> Our derivation, in contrast to that of previous works, is carried out directly in the infinite system. For a certain value of the asymmetry, we found a two dimensional representation of the algebra (see (3.1) and (3.2)). It would be interesting to see whether, as in <ref> [23, 27] </ref>, there are other values of the asymmetry for which one can use finite dimensional representations. In the weak asymmetry limit p ! 1=2, the measure can be understood in terms of the solutions of the macroscopic viscous Burgers equation.

Reference-contexts: In the weak asymmetry limit p ! 1=2, the measure can be understood in terms of the solutions of the macroscopic viscous Burgers equation. Several recent works have studied the gap of the evolution operator or generator [39, 40], as well as the diffusion constant <ref> [31] </ref>, on a ring of size L, in the double lmit p ! 1=2, L ! 1. A simple scaling form was found for the diffusion constant; it would be nice to see whether a scaling form in either problem could also be derived from a macroscopic equation.

Reference-contexts: In the weak asymmetry limit p ! 1=2, the measure can be understood in terms of the solutions of the macroscopic viscous Burgers equation. Several recent works have studied the gap of the evolution operator or generator <ref> [39, 40] </ref>, as well as the diffusion constant [31], on a ring of size L, in the double lmit p ! 1=2, L ! 1.
