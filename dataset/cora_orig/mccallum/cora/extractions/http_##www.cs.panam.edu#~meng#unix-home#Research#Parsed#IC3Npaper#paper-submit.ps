Abstract: Gis2web is a system intended to bridge the gap between GIS software and datasets and the WWW. The system operates by periodically accessing distributed datasets of GIS information and creating a common repository of WWW accessible information on a gis2web server. In this way gis2web users are provided seamless access to different datasets which may be of quite different forms. This paper discusses the architecture and communications issues of gis2web.

Reference-contexts: Typical GIS software maintains, manipulates, and displays this information in dynamic and graphical ways. The traditional mode of operation is to have the data accessible from within a specific GIS application on a single platform. With the recent wide-spread acceptance and availability of World Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [3] </ref> technology, it is natural to look toward building linkages between the two distinct worlds of GIS and the WWW in order to make the wealth of information available in the GIS world publicly available through the WWW.

Reference-contexts: Typical sorts of information range from geologic and biologic inventory maps to census and remote sensing data <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Use of such information is increasing in a wide range of research, education, commercial, and government decision-making contexts. Any collection of GIS information would include vector maps, raster images, tables, graphs, and text which are interrelated and dependent on each other.

Reference-contexts: WWW servers and browsers today use the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) <ref> [10] </ref> to communicate with clients and the hyper-text mark-up language (HTML) [11] to operate on text and a relatively small set of pre-defined types of images. HTML in general does not support the features required by a GIS, nor are they appropriate, given that HTML is a hypertext language.

Reference-contexts: A number of projects have focused on making GIS information readily available for WWW users in order to close the gap between the two communities. BADGER (Bay Area Digital GeoResource) is a project providing geographic information for the San Francisco Bay area in digital format accessible through the WWW <ref> [12] </ref>. BADGER generates a sequence of digital maps of different details, and users can view or download the images as needed. The U.S. government has made efforts to standardize catalog repositories of datasets so that users can browse, evaluate, and order them efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Because this module interacts directly with GIS information, it needs to interpret the format and structure of the GIS information and also communicate with the gis2web server using standard protocols. For 4 these reasons, in the prototype the module is written in the Arc/View programming language, Avenue <ref> [17] </ref>. Messenger: The Messenger communicates with the GIS server and accepts information sent by the GISExtractor. The information can be in various formats, e.g., text, tables, or images.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as Arc/Info and GRASS <ref> [18] </ref> contain rich and diverse information such as census data, municipal data, business data, highway networks, and geologic data. Information is stored in formats including tables, images, and text. Typical GIS software maintains, manipulates, and displays this information in dynamic and graphical ways.
