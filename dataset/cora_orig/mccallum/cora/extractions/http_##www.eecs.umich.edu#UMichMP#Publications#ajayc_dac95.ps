Abstract: This paper describes a RAM compiler for generating and characterizing highly manufacturable optimized SRAMs using GaAs E/D MESFET technology. The compiler uses a constraint-driven design ow to achieve process tolerant RAMs. This compiler was built using a exible design framework that can be easily adapted to optimize and characterize memories in different MESFET processes.

Reference-contexts: A memory clock signal is used to initiate read or write operations at the beginning of each cycle. This signal is used to generate an internal equalization pulse which is used to precharge the bit lines. Details of the circuits used in this compiler can be found in <ref> [4] </ref> and [5]. The major cells used in the RAM are shown in the block diagram of Fig. 1. The pulse generator, sense-amplifiers, write circuitry, equalization circuitry, memory cell array, cell-ground drivers, and word-line drivers are tiled so that routing is achieved by simply abutting the cells.
