Abstract: We report on the development of a fuzzy system providing a low-level obstacle-avoidance navigation for a robot in an office environment. The system employs reactive and deliberative rule-based behaviors in a unified manner, allowing them to compete and compromise in controlling the robot. The system is constructed hierarchically, and successfully employs less than 100 rules to control a 28-variable space. We show that the system acts distinctively different than crisp behavior arbitration approaches in that it allows for all behaviors to influence the control of the robot in parallel, each to degree to which it is appropriate. This approach is a step towards a unified view of reaction and deliberation as responses to an external and internal environments, respectively.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Autonomous mobile robots have served for many years as valuable testbeds for AI research. Numerous studies have been performed towards developing robots that can carry out their tasks in complex dynamic environments while avoiding physical obstacles (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], [3], [5], [6]). We report on the design and implementation of a low-level navigation system which avoids obstacles while attempting to reach goal locations.

We report on the design and implementation of a low-level navigation system which avoids obstacles while attempting to reach goal locations. <p> In short, we are seeking reliable performance from a system whose sensors and information are inherently unreliable and inaccurate. 2. FUZZY BEHAVIORS Based on the idea of reactive behavior-based architectures ([1], <ref> [2] </ref>, [3]) we have modeled the design of the controller on a competition between two behaviors for control of the robot. An obstacle-avoidance behavior selfishly attempts to keep the robot at a distance from any physical object which it can sense through the sonars. <p> It is deliberative in the sense that the behavior mostly ignores the robots surroundings, responding instead to internal goals based on models of the world (as existing in the higher levels of the architecture). While crisp examples of behavior-based competition choose between all the behaviors competing for influence ([1], <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], [10], [11]) the fuzzy approach allows for gradual compromises to be made, allowing both behaviors to influence the output to the degree that they are appropriate.

The robot has 24 ultrasonic long-range sonar sensors spread about the robot body and internal position and orientation detectors (x,y, f ). It accepts primitive commands controlling velocity, heading, etc.

Reference-contexts: We preferred writing rules which do not attempt to make decisions based on a global criteria, but instead tested only a single sonar sensor on the IF side, with appropriate selfish output set on the THEN side. The center-of-gravity defuzzification <ref> [7] </ref>, [8] combines all the fired rules effects into a coherent decision on the output commands issued to the robot. Simple rules provide a broad coverage of the input space. This effectively reduces the overall number of rules required, and provides coarse-grain approximation which is sufficient for our purposes.

Reference-contexts: However, the system must deal with a large variable space: 27 input variables (24 sonars, orientation, goal distance and heading), and 2 outputs (velocity, and the change to the current heading). Since fuzzy systems are vulnerable to the problem of an exponential number ([7], <ref> [8] </ref>) of rules (in the size of the variable space), we needed ways to reduce the number of rules while still maintaining acceptable performance. <p> We preferred writing rules which do not attempt to make decisions based on a global criteria, but instead tested only a single sonar sensor on the IF side, with appropriate selfish output set on the THEN side.

Reference-contexts: It is easier for the rule-writer to conceptualize the behavior of the robot as in the single-rule version above. We therefore structured the controller as two rule-bases (Fig. 1) which work in sequence, creating a two-level hierarchical system <ref> [9] </ref>. The first rule-base simply computes the relative readings - Forward, Back-Left, Right, etc. - and passes the results for processing in the second rule-base, which can now be much smaller and easier to work with. <p> There are theoretical results of the benefits of hierarchical systems, and the optimal structure of such systems <ref> [9] </ref>.
