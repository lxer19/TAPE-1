Abstract: A real-time correspondence based tracking algorithm is detailed. The system uses a pipeline processor, a general purpose processor, a camera and a display. The Minimum Noise and Correlation Energy (MINACE) filter is used in the tracking algorithm as it provides a good combination of speed, accuracy and flexibility for the targeted hardware system. The system designed is fast and tracking is accomplished at a rate of 15hz. The system is adaptive and does not rely on a previous model of the object; the training image for filter synthesis is acquired from previous image frames and the filter is synthesized online to ac-comodate 3-D variations of the target being tracked. The system tracks an object consistantly as is demonstrated by the low deviation of the results in the evaluation. The correlation filter-based tracking algorithm has proved to be useful in our research in cooperative mobile robots. A visual servoing system has been implemented using this tracking algorithm for convoying of multiple mobile robots.

Reference-contexts: The image created by the camera is a 2-D interpretation of a 3-D environment. In fact, "Much work in visual motion analysis has concentrated on recovering general 3-D motion and scene structure from passively acquired 2-D image sequences" <ref> [1] </ref>. The final factor that effects visual tracking is camera noise. Random changes in the image due to the noise of the camera must be taken into account. All of the listed factors can cause problems with tracking the object.

Reference-contexts: These include line segments, points and corners [8,9]. Optical Flow : Optical flow can be defined as the velocity with which image points move in a sequence of images. Optical flow can be used to track objects which exhibits relative motion in the image planes <ref> [10] </ref>. Correlation Techniques : This is the technique used in this paper. In this techniques, a small area is cut from an image frame and is searched for in the images to follow.

Reference-contexts: The two commonly used techniques of correlation are the normalized cross correlation <ref> [11] </ref> and the sum of squared difference [12]. Normalized cross correlation has been used for veregence by Marapane and Trivedi [13] and Papanikolopoulos [12] uses sum of squared difference correlation to track feature points sequences of images.

Finally, note that the two commonly used correlation techniques for target tracking, namely the normalized cross correlation [11,13,16] and the sum of squared difference <ref> [12] </ref>, both use correlations with an MSF to detect the target of interest. The difference between the two approaches is in their interpretation of the correlation values. By using the MSF, both these approaches are robust in the presence of white noise.

Correspondence Algorithms for Tracking Most of the techniques indicated above are suited for specific tracking problems and hence cannot be easily genaralized. <p> Thus we have to deal with only one feature value while the multi-feature algorithm deals with a set of these values. Filter synthesis is computa--tionally inexpensive and it is possible to generate new filters on-line. With advanced correlation filter synthesis algorithms <ref> [14] </ref>, there are almost no constraints on the type of target to be tracked, and this flexibility makes correspondence algorithms a viable choice for real-time implementation. The detection of a known input signal in the presence of noise using a matched spatial filter (MSF) is well known. <p> The most well-known correlation filters are the synthetic discriminant function (SDF) and its variations. The more recent correlation filters <ref> [14] </ref> use additional constraints during filter synthesis to control correlation plane response. These linear combination filter techniques may be suitable for 3-D distortion-invariant pattern recognition in the presence of a large training set. <p> Given the various sources of problem in Section 2., it becomes necessary to adopt a filter synthesis scheme where these noise sources can be modelled and used during filter synthesis. We now consider the MINACE filter algorithm <ref> [14] </ref> that minimizes the correlation plane energy due to the training images and noise. The discrete Fourier transform is used in the creation of the MINACE filter mask, since the preprocessor is synthesized in the Fourier domain.

Reference-contexts: In such situations the motion of each robot may have to be coordinated with the rest of the robots. One such coordinated motion is convoying <ref> [17] </ref>. Convoying refers to the situation when a group of robots follow behind a leader. Forming robotic teams where some acts as leaders and others are followers has found to give better performance.

Reference-contexts: The two mobile robots, R2M2 and ELVIS, were used and demonstrates the convoying motion of the two. The R2M2 is an all terrain robot with articulated tracks and a 5 degree-of-freedom manipulator. ELVIS consists of a sensorized wheeled mobile base, a robot head with ten DOF <ref> [18] </ref>, and a VME based on-board computing system. The R2M2 is the leader and ELVIS follows it. Figure 3 shows the robotic convoy. The performance and robustness of the convoying system has been verified in a series of extensive laboratory trials. 6.
