Title: To Know or Not To Know: On the Utility of Models in Mobile Robotics

Abstract: This article describes Jeeves, one of the winning entries in the 1996 AAAI mobile robot competition. Jeeves tied for first place in the finals of the competition, after it won both preliminary trials. A key aspect in Jeeves's software design was the ability to acquire a model of the environment. The model, a geometric map constructed from sensory data while the robot performs its task, enabled Jeeves to sweep the arena efficiently. It facilitated the retrieval of balls and their delivery at the gate, and it helped to avoid unintended collisions with obstacles. This paper argues that Jeeves's success depended crucially on the existence of the model. It also argues that models are generally useful in mobile roboticseven in tasks as simple as the one faced in this competition.

Reference-contexts: Recently, there has been a more general discussion about the nature and the utility of models in robotics. It has been argued that the environment is its own best model <ref> [1] </ref> an argument that has often been interpreted in favor of reactive approaches that maintain a minimum of internal state.

Reference-contexts: This simple rule led us to make the robot almost always move with its maximum velocity. However, sometimes it is wise to move slower. Jeeves velocity was controlled by the dynamic window approach described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In essence, the dynamic window approach sets the velocity in accordance to the proximity of obstaclesassuming the robot stays on its current trajectory.

Reference-contexts: While reactive (history-free) search might work reasonably well for finding balls as long as the number of total balls is large, theoretical and empirical research on the complexity of search has shown that history-free search strategies tend to be very inefficient for searching large environments exhaustively <ref> [4] </ref>. : : : an arena with ten times as many balls. More balls would force a robot to return to the gate more frequently. A purely reactive approach would have to search for the gate even if it has been there before.
