Abstract: A global classification of all currently known protein sequences is performed. Every protein sequence is partitioned into segments of 50 amino acids and a dynamic-programming distance is calculated between each pair of segments. This space of segments is first embedded into Euclidean space with small metric distortion. A novel self-organized cross-validated clustering algorithm is then applied to the embedded space with Euclidean distances. The resulting hierarchical tree of clusters offers a new representation of protein sequences and families, which compares favorably with the most updated classifications based on functional and structural protein data. Motifs and domains such as the Zinc Finger, EF hand, Homeobox, EGF-like and others are automatically correctly identified. A novel representation of protein families is introduced, from which functional biological kinship of protein families can be deduced, as demonstrated for the transporters family.

Reference-contexts: In order to evaluate the quality of this clustering we made various comparisons with a known partial classification of proteins, namely the protein families in PROSITE (release 12.1 October 1994 <ref> [Bairoch 1993] </ref>). This list of about 700 groups of related proteins comprises 46% of the proteins in the databank 6 . Henceforth, a "family" of proteins always refers to a class on this list and the nomenclature of PROSITE is adopted.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, they may fail to account for multi-trait phenomena in proteins, since they are derived from local considerations. Therefore, we chose segments of 50 amino acids, and not complete proteins, as our basic building blocks. Protein sequences in SWISSPROT <ref> [Bairoch & Boeckman 1992] </ref> release 30 (12/94), with fewer than 50 amino acids were eliminated. Each of the 38,106 remaining longer sequences was divided into segments of 50 amino acids with a 50% or higher overlap among consecutive segments, yielding a total of 544,000 segments.

Reference-contexts: This criterion is clearly very strict, and more relaxed criteria for the matching are examined as well. This clustering protocol is computationally intensive and was performed using the MOSIX distributed system <ref> [Barak et al. 1995] </ref>. 4 Singular value decomposition (SVD [Press et al. 1988]) is applied to the covariance matrix of each current cluster.

Reference-contexts: This partition into segments maps most functional and structural domains into one or two segments 2 . Henceforth, the term segment always refers to one of the above All pairwise similarity scores between segments were computed, using Compugene's Bioccelerator <ref> [Compugen 1996] </ref>, that performs the SW dynamic programming algorithm [Smith & Waterman 1981], with the Blosum62 distances matrix [Henikoff & Henikoff 1992] 3 . 1 While this measure may fail to satisfy the triangle inequality, such failures occur with frequency below 10 7 , and hardly affect our results. 2 This <p> The two disagree at about 20% of the cases, where SW yields improved alignments (with gaps) and scores that differ by factors up to 2. Fortunately, Compugene's Bioccelerator hardware <ref> [Compugen 1996] </ref> made the SW algorithm computationally feasible. 5 If s (u; v) is the SW similarity score between the segments u; v, then their distance is defined via d (u; v) = s (u; u) + s (v; v) 2 s (u; v).

Reference-contexts: A new sequence is analyzed by extrapolating the properties of its "neighbors". From the perspective of computational learning theory, this is a naive "nearest neighbor classifier" approach to modeling and to generalization from a model to new sequences <ref> [Cover & Hart 1967] </ref>. We seek a globally consistent organization of the sequences that would reveal relationships among protein families and yield deeper insights into the nature of newly discovered sequences.

Reference-contexts: Thus, not only membership in small clusters is informative. Membership in large and complex clusters may play a significant role in characterizing biological families. Fingerprints of protein families allow quantitative comparisons among families: pick any distance measure among probability distributions, e.g., KL-divergence <ref> [Cover & Thomas 1991] </ref> or variational distance. The similarity between two protein families is quantified by the distance of their fingerprints. In this way we can find, for each family, its proximal families.

Reference-contexts: motif, and the homeobox domain. 10 The zinc finger motif The zinc finger motif is found in many DNA binding proteins (like transcription factors) in which the zinc finger is the DNA binding domain, but also in certain proteins in which the role of the zinc finger is unknown (see <ref> [Cukierman et al. 1995] </ref>). These proteins are characterized by 2-30 finger-like sub-structures, each centered around a zinc ion. Each finger is about 30 residues long, with only a few highly conserved amino acids within it. Cluster 35 corresponds to this motif.

Reference-contexts: It has been a major goal of computational learning theory to provide conditions under which good generalization can be derived from small samples (e.g. <ref> [Kearns & Vazirani 1994] </ref>). It is well known, that overfitting to the training data can be avoided via cross-validation, i.e., testing the parameters of clusters against independent validation data. Generalization in high dimensional spaces is a notoriously problematic task.

Reference-contexts: Other basic Euclidean geometric constructs, such as directions are of great help as well. In this view, we begin by embedding the metric space in question into Eu-clidean space. A recently developed algorithm <ref> [Linial et al. 1995] </ref> yields embeddings where (i) distances in the Euclidean space are in good agreement with the original metric, and (ii) the dimension of the host space is relatively small. <p> Euclidean embedding The Euclidean embedding algorithm from <ref> [Linial et al. 1995] </ref> was applied to the above metric space. Following the steps of this algorithm, we selected at random, from the distribution defined in the above algorithm, certain sets of segments. These sets are of varying sizes, and in our case the algorithm has altogether generated 209 sets. <p> Associated with every segment u is, then, the 209-dimensional vector (d (u; S)) with S ranging over all randomly selected sets. The Euclidean embedding of the collection of all segments maps every segment u to its corresponding 209-dimensional vector. For a rigorous analysis of this embedding, see <ref> [Linial et al. 1995] </ref>. Cross-validated hierarchical clustering Data clustering has been the method of choice for self-organizing point sets in Euclidean spaces for many years [Duda & Hart 1973]. Yet only recently has a clear distinction been made between the two different roles of clustering.

Reference-contexts: The quality of performance was estimated by taking a single member from each family in PROSITE, comparing it against all the database, and identifying its related proteins in the family. Identification was based on the following "equivalence number" identification criterion <ref> [Pearson 1995] </ref>: Define the cutoff score as the similarity 8 The charge for switching from cluster i to cluster j is taken as c log (p (i)p (j)) + d (i; j) . <p> Only proteins with score at or above the cutoff score are considered as identified. The results were compared against the SW algorithm with blosum62 scoring matrix and values -10,-1 for gap penalties, currently considered the best method known <ref> [Pearson 1995] </ref>. Already with the BMR's simplistic approach, it competed successfully with SW on about 80 families of varying sizes (see Table 2). <p> Our method employs the current best sequence comparison algorithm, namely, SW dynamic programming with blosum62 similarity matrix and the matching parameters for penalizing sequence gaps <ref> [Pearson 1995] </ref>. Evaluations of this algorithm on full-length proteins showed excessive dependence on protein lengths. Furthermore, this algorithm usually fails to detect multi-trait features in proteins. Consequently, we chose to normalize the lengths, and computed this metric on segments of 50 amino acids (see footnote no. 1 for reservations).

Reference-contexts: This article presents a novel, computationally feasible method that yields a global model of the universe of protein sequences, and generalizes well to new sequences. 3 A metric derived from the Smith-Waterman (SW) dynamic programming measure of similarity <ref> [Smith & Waterman 1981] </ref> turns the space of protein sequences into a finite metric space. Our results are based only on the metric properties of this space, incorporating no further biological information. We begin by embedding the metric space in question into Euclidean space. <p> Indeed, our results could not be achieved without incorporating several recent developments in the theory of metric embedding, efficient graph algorithms, and unsupervised learning. Metric embedding A metric derived from the Smith-Waterman (SW) dynamic programming measure of similarity <ref> [Smith & Waterman 1981] </ref> turns the space of protein sequences into a finite metric 4 space 1 . Our underlying hypothesis is that the global structure of this metric space encodes much relevant information beyond what is revealed by local considerations that involve only specific pairwise comparisons. <p> This partition into segments maps most functional and structural domains into one or two segments 2 . Henceforth, the term segment always refers to one of the above All pairwise similarity scores between segments were computed, using Compugene's Bioccelerator [Compugen 1996], that performs the SW dynamic programming algorithm <ref> [Smith & Waterman 1981] </ref>, with the Blosum62 distances matrix [Henikoff & Henikoff 1992] 3 . 1 While this measure may fail to satisfy the triangle inequality, such failures occur with frequency below 10 7 , and hardly affect our results. 2 This choice of length is elaborated on in the Discussion. <p> We feel safe to say that this constitutes a genuine "self-organization" of all those protein segments. All the biochemical, evolutionary and functional background that is used in this procedure, is reduced to the definition of the SW <ref> [Smith & Waterman 1981] </ref> measure of similarity. In order to evaluate the quality of this clustering we made various comparisons with a known partial classification of proteins, namely the protein families in PROSITE (release 12.1 October 1994 [Bairoch 1993]).

Reference-contexts: This would follow only from stronger assumptions on the sample set. The validity of our clustering is thus monitored by splitting the data into two random subsets and the requirement that the clusters in the two sets perfectly agree at every level of the cluster hierarchy. By Vapnik's theory <ref> [Vapnik 1982] </ref>, this perfect correspondence between two independent samples, implies a tight upper bound on the probability that these two independent cluster sets disagree on the classification of new independent points. Likewise, a bound is obtained on the generalization error of the model.

Motifs and domains Some clusters exclusively match well defined motifs within proteins. That is, segments that correspond to a specific biological pattern were grouped together to form a well separated and distinct cluster.
