Reference-contexts: Many information retrieval mechanisms have been developed, and there is a wide variation in how they determine aboutness. Recent investigations have centred around formalizing the notion of aboutness by axiomatizing its properties in terms of a neutral, underlying theory of information <ref> [BH94, HB94] </ref>. This work is incomplete, however, as the apparent nonmonotonic behaviour of aboutness has only briefly been touched upon. By nonmonotonicity we mean the following: Assume that document d is about information carrier q. If information is added to d, the resultant document may not be about q. <p> Furthermore, an aboutness relation j= a is assumed over the information carriers. The notation i j= a j denotes that information carrier i is about carrier j. The intuition behind this is that the "information borne by j holds in i" <ref> [BH94] </ref>. This definition can be found explicitly or implicitly in several papers on logic-based information retrieval [Coo71, Rij86, Bru93]. Although this definition is intuitive, it expresses that aboutness is some form of entailment. Recent work has attempted to establish the properties of this relation via an axiomatic approach [BH94, HB94]. <p> This definition can be found explicitly or implicitly in several papers on logic-based information retrieval [Coo71, Rij86, Bru93]. Although this definition is intuitive, it expresses that aboutness is some form of entailment. Recent work has attempted to establish the properties of this relation via an axiomatic approach <ref> [BH94, HB94] </ref>. This research has shown that the relation is not a classical form of entailment. For example, the And rule does not hold. <p> Nevertheless, we believe that the theorem is very relevant for information retrieval. Up to now, aboutness has been considered as being monotonic with regard to information composition <ref> [BH94] </ref>. By way of illustration: if we know that information carrier i is about carrier k, then composing information j to i will not disturb the aboutness relation with k.

Reference-contexts: Consider information carrier i. Each situation s that i discriminates can be considered a model of i because situation s "supports" the information carried by i (denoted s j= i). That is, we have adopted a situation-theoretic stance; the information carried by i is "true" in situation s <ref> [Dev91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This article will investigate this behaviour and propose two rules which permit a conservative form of information composition. These rules are essentially information retrieval equivalents of the rational and cautious monotonicity properties found in the Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor meta-theory of nonmonotonic reasoning <ref> [KLM90] </ref>. 2 Background and Preliminaries In this article we will investigate certain logical properties of aboutness within the framework of a language the words of which represent so called term phrases. These phrases are natural language expressions used to characterize information objects. <p> Assuming that the searcher does not want to be informed by an infinite number of situations, we will take the set S to be finite. As a consequence a so called smoothness condition is guaranteed, the details of which are not relevant to this article (see <ref> [KLM90] </ref> for precise details). Preferential structures are being investigated within meta-theories for nonmonotonic reasoning [KLM90, Sho89]. In these investigations, the preference relation, denoted @ has to do with "normality". <p> As a consequence a so called smoothness condition is guaranteed, the details of which are not relevant to this article (see [KLM90] for precise details).

For example, the situation in which Tweety is a bird and flies, is considered more normal than a situation where Tweety is a bird and doesn't fly.

Reference-contexts: These phrases are natural language expressions used to characterize information objects. The language, denoted L T , is based on a set T of terms. The words of this language will be referred to as information carriers. A fundamental property of information carriers is that they can be composed <ref> [Lan86] </ref>. For example, consider the information carriers information and retrieval. These can be composed to form the carrier (information retrieval). This information carrier corresponds to the term phrase information retrieval. The symbol is used to denote information composition.

Reference-contexts: As it is not associative, cannot be distibuted in the normal way. The following distributions can be motivated from a linguistic standpoint <ref> [LD94] </ref>: (i j) k = (i j) (j k) For example, the information carrier (hydrogen ion) exchange can be viewed as the composition of the information carriers hydrogen ion and ion exchange. Not all information carriers can be meaningfully composed.

Reference-contexts: This 7 approach has the advantage that the initial defaults could be tailored to the searcher's given information need. A second approach would be to have a set of predefined defaults like those being used in the Cyc project <ref> [LGP + 90] </ref>. The assumption underlying this approach is that these defaults would be applicable for a large percentage of searchers. As mentioned earlier, information retrieval lacks a model-theoretic framework. Such a framework is necessary to scrutinize aboutness inference mechanisms. This article has presented the rudiments of such a framework.

Then L @ is monotonic if and only if @ is an equivalence relation. <p> Each situation s that i discriminates can be considered a model of i because situation s "supports" the information carried by i (denoted s j= i). That is, we have adopted a situation-theoretic stance; the information carried by i is "true" in situation s [Dev91]. Adapting Shoham's definition <ref> [Sho89] </ref> allows a so called preferential situation to be introduced as follows: Definition 4.1 A situation s; s 2 S preferentially satisfies an information carrier i (written s j= N i) if * s j= i * there is no situation t such that t @ N s and t j=
