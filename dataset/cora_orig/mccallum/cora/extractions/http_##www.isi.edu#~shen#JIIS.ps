Abstract: The standard approach to integrating heterogeneous information sources is to build a global schema that relates all of the information in the different sources, and to pose queries directly against it. The problem is that schema integration is usually difficult, and as soon as any of the information sources change or a new source is added, the process may have to be repeated. The SIMS system uses an alternative approach. A domain model of the application domain is created, establishing a fixed vocabulary for describing data sets in the domain. Using this language, each available information source is described. Queries to SIMS against the collection of available information sources are posed using terms from the domain model, and reformulation operators are employed to dynamically select an appropriate set of information sources and to determine how to integrate the available information to satisfy a query. This approach results in a system that is more flexible than existing ones, more easily scalable, and able to respond dynamically to newly available or unexpectedly missing information sources. This paper describes the query reformulation process in SIMS and the operators used in it. We provide precise definitions of the reformulation operators and explain the rationale behind choosing the specific ones SIMS uses. We have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach by applying SIMS in the domains of transportation planning and medical trauma care.

Reference-contexts: The combination of semantic modeling and dynamic reformulation of queries provides a much more flexible and easily extensible interface to a possibly changing collection of information sources. The situation is similar with multidatabase systems such as Pegasus <ref> [1] </ref> and UniSQL [15]. Pegasus addresses the semantic heterogeneity problem primarily by requiring users/administrators to write specific programs that will reconcile semantic differences. Pegasus does have one kind of reformulation strategy that is similar to SIMS', in which a superclass can be specialized into a collection of its subclasses.

In Proceedings of the ARPA / Rome Laboratory Knowledge-Based Planning and Scheduling Initiative, </title> <address> Tucson, AZ, </address> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: SIMS can even replan if an information source is discovered to be unavailable during the process of executing a plan that was created under the assumption that the source was available. There are four basic components to query-processing in SIMS <ref> [2] </ref>. These are: * Query reformulation This component identifies the sources of information that are required in order to answer a query and determines how data from them must be combined to produce precisely what the user requested.

Reference-contexts: This is done by reformulating the 3 user's query expressed in domain terms into queries to specific information sources. This subtask of SIMS is the subject of this paper. An early version of the query reformulation process in SIMS was briefly described in <ref> [3] </ref>. This paper refines those early ideas, presents the detailed specification of the reformulation operators, and describes the search process. * Query access planning The second component constructs a plan for retrieval of the information requested by the reformulated query (and hence, by the original query). <p> On the other hand, the system would not even attempt to reformulate that portion of the query if there were at least one database that contained all of the required information about ports. In earlier versions of SIMS <ref> [3] </ref>, the system would completely reformulate a domain query into an information-source query before generating the query access plan. In that case, the system would search for a reformulation of the query that required the smallest number of reformulation operators.

Reference-contexts: Both the data manipulation operators and the query reformulation operators are specified in a general operator language and are used in a general-purpose planner called sage [17], which is built on the ucpop <ref> [4] </ref> planning system. The advantage of integrating the query planning and reformulation process is that the system can now generate estimates on the cost of processing partially constructed plans. This information is used within a branch-and-bound search to find the lowest cost plan to implement a query.

Reference-contexts: The example has been simplified from the actual domain in order to provide a short, self-contained description of a model. The domain model is described in the Loom language [22], which is a member of the KL-ONE family of knowledge representation systems <ref> [5] </ref>. The basic objects in Loom are classes (also called concepts), which define a set of related instances, and roles, which define the attributes of a class.

Reference-contexts: In SIMS, source selection is integrated into query access planning, so SIMS will attempt to minimize the overall cost of a query and not just the number of sources accessed. The Model-assisted Global Querying System (MGQS) <ref> [6] </ref> uses a model (a meta-database in their terminology) to describe the contents, organization, and data management facilities of the data sources it accesses. There are, however, significant differences between MGQS and SIMS in the modeling methodology and the reformulation processes.

Reference-contexts: In SIMS we attempt to address this 29 n 2 problem by providing a single reference vocabulary (the domain model) with which to describe each new information source independently of the others. The Carnot system <ref> [7] </ref>, [13], similar to SIMS, integrates heterogeneous databases using a knowledge representation system (CYC [19]). Carnot uses a knowledge base to build a set of articulation axioms that describe how to map between the tables and columns in the databases and the concepts in the domain model.

Reference-contexts: To the extent that reformulations are performed in MGQS, they are predefined, determined by relationships expressed in the domain model. They are not dynamic in the sense of the reformulations in SIMS. The SIMS approach bears a superficial similarity to equational rewriting, e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>. However, our rewrite rules are not equations in the sense used by such systems. 30 The SIMS equivalent of the right-hand side of an equation is not a formula in the representation language we are using it is a search strategy.

The extension of SIMS to OODBs and flat files would appear to be straightforward, and is planned in the near future. 7.

Reference-contexts: However, building a tightly coupled federated system requires constructing a global schema for the databases to be combined. A given query would then always be mapped to the same combination of queries to the underlying databases. An example of this is the work on Multibase <ref> [18] </ref>, where the basic goals are the same as those of SIMS, but the mapping between the global schema and the local schemas is hard wired.

Reference-contexts: This attempts to insure no loss of expressive power. The functionality supported by the following two operators is roughly equivalent to that available in <ref> [20] </ref>. Levy et al. treat the problem as one of integrating materialized relations each could represent an information source into a view represented by a query. This work shows that the complexity of the problem is NP-complete (or worse in the case of a more expressive language). 12 3.3. <p> Their approach provides an interesting alternative to the one presented in this paper. Instead of using an object model (as in SIMS) for integrating the various information sources, they use an object-relational model. Their approach to integration is based on view integration <ref> [20] </ref>, and it provides functionality that is equivalent to the operators for reformulating the minimal model in SIMS. However, without extending their modeling and/or processing, they cannot perform the other operators for traversing the augmented domain model (i.e., the substitution and infer-equivalence operators).

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the domain model in SIMS is an integral part of the system, allowing SIMS to combine information sources dynamically and in novel ways not anticipated at design time. The Information Manifold <ref> [21] </ref>, like SIMS, provides an approach to dynamically integrating information sources. The system also uses a knowledge representation system to integrate the various information sources. Their approach provides an interesting alternative to the one presented in this paper.

Figure 2).
