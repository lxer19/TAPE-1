Abstract: Single receiver source deconvolution in a shallow water environment is an ill-posed problem whose difficulty is compounded by the multipath nature of the propagation operator. If only sources that are quiescent prior to some initial time t 0 are considered, the result of discretizatizing the problem in the time domain is an ill-conditioned triangular Toeplitz system. In this paper we show how an algorithm of Elden can be used to implement Tikhonov-Phillips regularization for this system. Unlike the multichannel deconvolution techniques used in underwater acoustics, this method can extract source signatures using the outputs of a single sensor. In addition, when the propagation is multipath and source signature extraction is performed as part of an optimization procedure for environmental inversion, we can work with shorter time windows so that the process becomes computationally more efficient than frequency domain deconvolution. A number of examples of the use of the Tikhonov-Philips regularization method for source series extraction are provided. fl This report is available by anonymous ftp from thales.cs.umd.edu in the directory pub/reports. y University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 z Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University

Reference-contexts: We also assume that the origin has been adjusted to take into account the propagation time for the signal to arrive at the receiver. In some cases the discretization of equation (1) produces relatively well-conditioned linear systems of equations <ref> [1] </ref>. If T is greater than the impulse-response dissipation time and all of the source response is collected, one benefits greatly from considering the problem in the frequency domain, where the propagator's matrix representation is diagonal.

Reference-contexts: Two popular methods are based on techniques of projection and regularization. A bidiagonalization-regularization technique [13] is a combination of the two. The singular value decomposition can be used to implement a projection technique that is very reliable <ref> [2] </ref>. But it is an O (n 3 ) process in the number of matrix elements and is too slow for some applications with large n. There are iterative methods to regularize problems, many of which show promise [10].

Reference-contexts: As was mentioned earlier, the Fast Field Program takes advantage of the horizontal stratification and performs direct time-domain broad band computations. The time domain discretization is accomplished using the finite element method <ref> [3] </ref>. Consider a situation with a source placed at a depth of 15 meters and a receiver at a range of 100 meters from the source and a depth of 25 meters. The environment is as described earlier.

Reference-contexts: A natural advantage of Tikhonov-Phillips regularization is that, unlike multichannel deconvolution methods, it can be applied in situations where only one sensor is available.

In the next section we will introduce the discretization and describe Tikhonov-Phillips regularization.

Reference-contexts: Whenever P is relatively smooth or P (0) is very small compared to the root mean square of P , as is the case in most time series deconvolution problems <ref> [13] </ref>, the resulting system will generally be quite ill-conditioned. However, the causes of ill-conditioning are different for the two cases. 1. If the kernel is smooth it will map highly oscillatory functions into small functions as the positive and negative parts of the oscillations cancel one another. <p> There are a number of techniques that stabilize the source deconvolution process for a single receiver. A good survey of those techniques is given by Hanke and Hansen [10]. Two popular methods are based on techniques of projection and regularization.

Reference-contexts: For our problem the environment is a stratified shallow water column overlying a simple bottom. Propagations are very short range ( &gt; 300m ). The wave model of choice is the Fast Field Program <ref> [15] </ref>, which takes advantage of the medium stratification. The computational cost of running the model is roughly proportional to the square of the propagation time. <p> The interfaces have zero roughness. All the receiver and source series were generated using the Fast Field Program <ref> [15] </ref>. The first derivative constraint for the Tikhonov-Philips regularization of the problems was used throughout.
