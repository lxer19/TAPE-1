Abstract: This paper describes the Fracas computer-integrated orthopaedic system for assisting surgeons in closed long bone fracture reduction. Fracas' goals are to reduce the surgeon's cumulative exposure to radiation and improve the positioning accuracy by replacing uncorrelated static fluoroscopic images with a "virtual reality" display of 3D bone models created from preoperative CT and tracked intraoperatively in real-time. Fluoroscopic images are used to register the bone models to the intraoperative situation and to verify that the registration is maintained. This paper describes the system concept, the software prototypes of the modeling, preoperative planning, visualization, and fluoroscopic image processing modules, and preliminary experimental results.

Reference-contexts: We are currently developing a computer-integrated orthopaedic system, called Fracas, for closed medullary nailing of long bone fractures. Medullary nailing is a very frequent routine procedure that restores the integrity of the fractured bone by means of a nail inserted in the medullary canal <ref> [1] </ref>. The nail is placed without surgically exposing the fracture through an opening close to the tronchanteric fossa in the proximal femoral bone. The surgeon manually aligns the bone fragments, inserts a guide wire, enlarges the canal if necessary, and drives in the nail with a hammer.

Reference-contexts: We thus acquire dewarping maps and camera parameters at several preselected C-arm orientations, e.g., anterior-posterior and lateral. To reliably extract bone contours from fluoroscopic images, we developed a new bone contour segmentation algorithm based on robust image region statistics computation <ref> [2] </ref>. Working on the gradient image, the algorithm starts by computing a global threshold and then performs region growing based on adaptive local thresholds and zero-crossings filtering. Because the algorithm uses both global and local thresholds, it is less sensitive to the exposure variations across the field of view.

Reference-contexts: Filtering the result with the original image zero crossings localizes the contour inside the region. Figure 3 shows typical results from an actual surgery. 4. CURRENT AND FUTURE WORK Our current work focuses on registering the extracted bone contours with surface bone models obtained from preoperative CT images <ref> [3] </ref>. Our experiments suggest that after dewarping and calibration, submillimetric spatial positioning accuracy, possibly better than 0.5mm, is achievable with standard equipment. Preliminary contour segmentation results show good contour tracing with very few outliers. These can be removed with a simple model-based scheme or by combining segmentation and registration [3]. <p> images <ref> [3] </ref>.

PREVIOUS WORK AND MOTIVATION Two computer-based systems for long bone fracture reduction [7,12] and <ref> [4] </ref> focus on distal screw locking. Both use intraoperative fluoroscopy and optical tracking without preoperative CT images. [7,12] uses a passive mechanical arm with optical encoders to guide the surgeon to the right drilling position. <p> It automatically identifies the distal holes in the fluoroscopic images, plans the drilling trajectory, and constraints the motions of the passive arm. <ref> [4] </ref> continuously displays the projection of the surgical tools as they move on preselected fluoroscopic images, thus approximating continuous fluoroscopy. Since the images are correlated, the surgeon can simultaneously view the tool's progression from several viewpoints. This is similar to the conventional procedure and reduces the number of images needed.

Reference-contexts: Significant skill, time, and frequent use of the fluoroscope are required, leading to positioning errors and complications, and to significant cumulative radiation exposure of the surgeon <ref> [8] </ref>. Recent research shows that computer-aided systems can significantly improve the accuracy of orthopaedic procedures by replacing fluoroscopic guidance with interactive display of three-dimensional (3D) bone models created from pre-operative CT studies and tracked in real-time. Examples include systems for acetabular cup placement [10] and pedicle screw insertion [5,6].
