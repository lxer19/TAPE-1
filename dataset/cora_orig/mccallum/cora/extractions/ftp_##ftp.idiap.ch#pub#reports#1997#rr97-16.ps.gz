Reference-contexts: We use a commercially available LCLV having a nematic liquid crystal as the electro-optic material. Optical thresholding maintains the spatial (optical parallelism) and overcomes the serial processing bottleneck of electronic thresholding <ref> [1] </ref>. We report here experiments on perceptron recall using an optical NN system described earlier [2]. The effect of a modified grey-scale to weight mapping for a set of weight levels implemented by LCTVs is measured for handwritten digit recognition using computer learned weight matrices. <p> For our purposes the 32fi32 matrix has been converted to an 8fi8 matrix, by taking the average of 4fi4 sub-matrices, and the input values have been scaled to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The target patterns are the ten unit vectors for training of the multilayer neural network on the computer for which a subset of 500 patterns is first used.

The effect of a modified grey-scale to weight mapping for a set of weight levels implemented by LCTVs is measured for handwritten digit recognition using computer learned weight matrices. An optical thresholding perceptron is composed of two parts: matrix-vector-multiplier (MVM) and a thresholding device. <p> Optical systems with large interconnections, favour a system with space invariant interconnects <ref> [2] </ref> using diffraction gratings. The information channels in this system (fig. 1) are coded in the intensity of the light using high resolution LCTV screens, LCTV1 and LCTV2, taken from a Seiko-Epson VPJ700 video projector.

Reference-contexts: The measured response function of an LCLV [9] is used as the soft thresholding function. A subset of 50 patterns of hand-written digits was taken from the NIST database set <ref> [3] </ref> as the training data. Training is continued until the maximum difference over all output units and all patterns becomes less than a predefined acceptable interval. <p> stored LCLV response curve); in the second stage, the integration is done by a demagnifying telescopic system and thresholding by the LCLV, as discussed in the following sections. 3.1 Input Test Patterns The NIST benchmark on handwritten digits consists of a database with 20790 digitized handwritten characters from 2100 individuals <ref> [3] </ref>. Each digit was scaled to fit into a 32fi32 matrix, and each pixel is represented by an eight bit value.

Reference-contexts: Since MLPs with a soft threshold at the hidden layer are very appealing for a large range of applications <ref> [4] </ref>, these algorithms, when implemented in optics, offer the additional benefits inherent in the parallelism of the optical approach. We implement an optical perceptron with a soft optical threshold trained with an adapted BP algorithm [6][9] as a precursor to an optical MLP.

Reference-contexts: In order to make these output values independent of the size of each digit, an input normalization procedure could be used. This may be obtained by scaling the digit length vectors to the same value <ref> [5] </ref>. Such a scaling may be more readily performed by simply scaling-up the pixel values to obtain the normalized length. However, in the optical implementation, the pixel value cannot exceed a value of unity (a maximum transmission).

Reference-contexts: Training is continued until the maximum difference over all output units and all patterns becomes less than a predefined acceptable interval. The interconnection weight matrix (IWM) defining the connections between the input and output neurons that is thus obtained <ref> [7] </ref> is used in our optical perceptron to test recall (or recognition) of presented input patterns on which it has been trained. The idea is to compare the computer simulated and the optical hardware performance. <p> Non-ideal sigmoidal responses (such as of LCLVs) can be incorporated in the BP training algorithm as described in <ref> [7] </ref>. Based on this training that is simulated on SUN SPARC-stations, a corresponding IWM is obtained, that is used to test recall on our optical perceptron.

Reference-contexts: The soft threshold can be implemented by an optical device, or an optically addressed spatial light modulator (SLM) with a non-linear response based on the electro-optic or magneto-optic effect, such as a thin-film SLM or a liquid crystal light valve (LCLV) <ref> [8] </ref>. We use a commercially available LCLV having a nematic liquid crystal as the electro-optic material. Optical thresholding maintains the spatial (optical parallelism) and overcomes the serial processing bottleneck of electronic thresholding [1]. We report here experiments on perceptron recall using an optical NN system described earlier [2].

Reference-contexts: The new weights are proportional to the derivative of the thresholding function. The matrix-vector product output is also thresholded by this same function to obtain the outputs which are then compared with the desired outputs. The measured response function of an LCLV <ref> [9] </ref> is used as the soft thresholding function. A subset of 50 patterns of hand-written digits was taken from the NIST database set [3] as the training data. Training is continued until the maximum difference over all output units and all patterns becomes less than a predefined acceptable interval.
