Abstract: We study relations between predicate transformers and multifunctions in a topological setting based on closure operators. We give topological definitions of safety and liveness predicates and using these predicates we define predicate transformers. State transformers are mul-tifunctions with values in the collection of fixed points of a closure operator. We derive several isomorphisms between predicate transformers and multifunctions. By choosing different closure operators we obtain multifunctions based on the usual power set construction, on the Hoare, Smyth and Plotkin power domains, and based on the compact and closed metric power constructions. Moreover, they are all related by isomorphisms to the predicate transformers.

Reference-contexts: The importance of these relationships is that they give a link between the denotational semantics and the axiomatic semantics of Dijkstra. From a more logical point of view, relationships between denotational and axiomatic semantics have been studied by Abramsky <ref> [Abr87] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the mathematical preliminaries and fixes the notation for topology, domain theory and metric spaces. Section 3 deals with closure operators, collects some basic facts and shows how to derive other closure operators from a topological closure operator.

Reference-contexts: Following Smyth [Smy83], non deterministic state transformers are represented by multifunctions (for more on multifunctions consult <ref> [Ber63] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: We consider continuous and multiplicative functions between open sets instead of continuous and finite multiplicative functions. Hence, if (Y; cl) is a sober space then a (Scott-)continuous function : O dl (Y ) ! c O cl (X) is finite multiplicative if and only if it is multiplicative. Best <ref> [Bes83] </ref> has proved such a result for countable flat partial orders. 17 The third step is to relate the jointly multiplicative predicate transformers and the Vietoris state transformers by an isomorphism that can be seen as a pair of (the generalization of) weakest preconditions and weakest liberal preconditions [Nel89].

Reference-contexts: Predicates are ordered by subset inclusion. Given two collections of predicates P (X) and P (Y ) on spaces X and Y , a predicate transformer is a monotone function from P (Y ) to P (X). Predicate transformers were introduced by Dijkstra <ref> [Dij76] </ref> to represent (possibly nondeterministic) computation of a program.

Reference-contexts: All the domains will be based on closure operators and by choosing specific closure operators we can derive standard constructions and results for sets, complete partial orders and metric spaces. We start with the definition of a closure operator <ref> [DP90] </ref>: 3.1. Definition. A closure operator on a set X is a function cl : P (X) ! P (X) such that (i) S cl (S) (ii) cl (S) = cl (cl (S)) 6 A closure operator is strict if cl (;) = ;. <p> The closure operator cl I is strict if ; 2 I and is a topological closure operator if ; 2 I and if I is closed under finite unions. The following lemma taken from <ref> [DP90] </ref> relates closure operators and intersection systems. 3.3. Lemma. Let cl be a closure operator over a set X. Then the closure operator induced by the intersection system P cl (X) is cl. On the other hand, let I be an intersection system on X.

Reference-contexts: We consider also restrictions of the power spaces to compact sets and to co-compact sets (the set-theoretic complement of compact sets). Our approach differs from the algebraic approach to power domain constructions for dcpo's in <ref> [Hec91] </ref>. Predicate transformers are based on two kinds of predicates: the safety and liveness predicates. Following Smyth [Smy83], we use topological definitions of safety and liveness predicates and again we base this definition on closure operators.

Reference-contexts: However, he uses sober spaces while we consider arbitrary T 0 -topological spaces. We do not use the Scott open filter theorem of Hoffman and Mislove <ref> [HM81] </ref> which uses the axiom of choice. The techniques used in this paper are more in line with the ones used in [Plo79]. In [BK93a] we constructed isomorphisms between predicate and state transformers for complete partial orders. <p> Next we consider the compact restriction of the upper power space. What restrictions are needed on the underlying space such that the compact restriction of the upper power space is a dcpo or an algebraic dcpo? For a dcpo the question has been answered in <ref> [HM81] </ref>: The underlying space should be sober. This is proved as follows. <p> is the map which associates to every saturated compact sets q 2 Q (X) the open filter fo 2 O (X) j q og. 2 (The isomorphism of the Theorem 4.8 does not hold for general topological spaces nor for arbitrary family of saturated subsets of a sober space X <ref> [HM81] </ref>.) With the isomorphism of Theorem 4.8 it is easy to prove that if (X; cl) is sober, then (P co "cl (X); U cl ) is a dcpo. This follows directly from 10 4.9. Corollary. Let (X; O (X)) be a sober space.

Reference-contexts: As running examples we treated sets, !-algebraic dcpo's and complete metric spaces. Continuous dcpo's <ref> [JA94] </ref> can be treated in a similar way (although we have to restrict to !-continuous or coherent continuous dcpo's to treat the Plotkin power domain). However, it is not yet clear if the techniques also apply to non-sober dcpo's.

Reference-contexts: Since frames represent abstract collections of observable predicates [Vic89], the question is whether we can generalize the results in this paper to the even more abstract view that predicate transformers are functions between frames and having Stone dualities <ref> [Joh82] </ref> (instead of the isomorphisms) for categories of T 0 -topological spaces with mul-tifunctions. In [BJK93] observation frames are introduced to construct points for T 0 -topological spaces and a Stone duality for the category of T 0 -topological spaces with continuous functions is given.

Reference-contexts: Our approach differs from the algebraic approach to power domain constructions for dcpo's in [Hec91]. Predicate transformers are based on two kinds of predicates: the safety and liveness predicates. Following Smyth <ref> [Smy83] </ref>, we use topological definitions of safety and liveness predicates and again we base this definition on closure operators.

It is not hard to see that "Sc (S) = fx j 9s 2 S: s v xg ="S. 4 Multifunctions and State Transformers In this section we define three kinds of state transformers using closure operators. Following Smyth <ref> [Smy83] </ref>, non deterministic state transformers are represented by multifunctions (for more on multifunctions consult [Ber63]). Let P be a collection of subsets of Y . <p> We denote the upper, the lower and the Vietoris space by (P; U cl ); (P; L cl ) and (P; V cl ), respectively. The three notions of continuity of a multifunction are related with the three topologies by the following Theorem ([Mic51] and also <ref> [Smy83] </ref>). 4.5. Theorem. Let X; Y be two topological spaces, f : X ! Y be a multifunction with value in P P (Y ) with P 6= ;. <p> (see [Plo81]) (P ne Sc (X); ) and the Plotkin power domain (see [Plo76], [Plo81]) (P Sc fl (X); V Sc ) are !-algebraic dcpo's and their Scott topology coincide, respectively, with the lower topology on P ne Sc (X) and the Vietoris topology on P ne;co pointed out in <ref> [Smy83] </ref>. We conclude this section with the definition of state transformers. 12 4.13. Definition. Let (X; cl) and (Y; dl) be topological spaces. <p> Then for every x 2 X, p 0 2 P 1 (Y ), and q 0 2 P 2 (Y ) we have: (i) x 2 (p 0 ) , fp j x 2 (p)g " fq j x 2 (q)g p 0 ; T T Following Smyth <ref> [Smy83] </ref> we see a topological space as a "data type" with the open sets as observable predicates. Closed sets are seen as safety predicates while arbitrary intersections of open sets are the liveness predicates. Predicate transformers are hence functions between open (or closed) sets. 5.8. Definition. <p> Again by stability Lemma 5.4 we obtain ! 1 ()(x) = fo 2 O dl (Y ) j x 2 (o)g o 0 : Therefore, by Lemma 2.2 ! 1 ()(x) is compact. 2 Using Theorem 4.8, Smyth <ref> [Smy83] </ref> was the first who realized that for a sober space (Y; dl) the following isomorphism holds: (X; cl) ! c (P co In Theorem 6.3, case 3., we do not have the requirement that (Y; cl) is sober.

Reference-contexts: If every subset S of P has least upper bound in P , then P is a complete lattice. A partially ordered set P has a least upper bound for every !-chain if and only if it contains all least upper bounds of all directed countable sets <ref> [Mar76, SP82] </ref>. In this case P is said to be an !-chain complete partially ordered set (!-ccpo).

Reference-contexts: However, it is not yet clear if the techniques also apply to non-sober dcpo's. The results are in the concrete framework where predicate transformers are (multiplicative) functions between collections of open sets. Since frames represent abstract collections of observable predicates <ref> [Vic89] </ref>, the question is whether we can generalize the results in this paper to the even more abstract view that predicate transformers are functions between frames and having Stone dualities [Joh82] (instead of the isomorphisms) for categories of T 0 -topological spaces with mul-tifunctions.
