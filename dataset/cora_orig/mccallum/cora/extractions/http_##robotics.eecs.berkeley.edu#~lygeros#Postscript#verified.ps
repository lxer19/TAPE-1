Abstract: The objective of an Automated Highway System (AHS) is to increase the safety and throughput of the existing highway infrastructure by introducing traffic automation. AHS is an example of a large scale, multi-agent, complex dynamical system and is ideally suited for a hierarchical hybrid controller. We discuss the design of safe and efficient hybrid controllers for regulation of vehicles on an AHS. We use game theoretic techniques to deal with the multi-agent and multi-objective nature of the problem. The result is a hybrid controller that by design guarantees safety, without the need for further verification. The calculations also provide an upper bound on the performance that can be expected in terms of throughput at various levels of centralization.

Reference-contexts: The question of safety is one of the most important issues for AHS and has therefore attracted considerable attention. In the context of platooning, the issue of controller design and safety for platoon followers has been addressed extensively in <ref> [25] </ref>. For autonomous vehicles and platoon leaders a number of controllers have been proposed [26, 27, 28], some without explicit safety guarantees. [29] highlighted problems, due primarily to the hybrid nature of the system, that may arise if such guarantees are not provided. <p> Besides the limitations of scope introduced in Assumption 1, we will not address the design of control laws for the follower mode. This problem is particularly challenging and has received considerable attention in recent years <ref> [25, 38] </ref>. The most obvious difficulty is regulating to the constant follower spacing at all speeds, without running into the preceding vehicle. <p> This problem is particularly challenging and has received considerable attention in recent years [25, 38]. The most obvious difficulty is regulating to the constant follower spacing at all speeds, without running into the preceding vehicle. In <ref> [25] </ref> it was shown that to achieve this objective a vehicle needs information about the acceleration of the preceding vehicle, in addition to the spacing and relative velocity information available through the sensors. <p> Another problem is that small disturbances (e.g., a transient change in the velocity of the platoon leader) may get amplified as they propagate from one follower to the next, possibly resulting in collisions down the string. In <ref> [25] </ref> it was shown that to avoid this slinky effect followers also need information about the state of the platoon leader in addition to information about the vehicle immediately ahead of them. <p> Because the delays of point-to-point communication increase with the size of the platoon, this information has to be broadcast by the leader (using a radio link for example). Finally, in <ref> [25] </ref> it was shown that, the follower control law will result in amplification of the control effort exerted by followers further back in the platoon. This imposes restrictions on the operation of the leader. <p> Two platoons moving at slightly different speeds collide and become one platoon. If the intra-platoon spacing is small and Assumption 3 is satisfied, after a finite number of intra-platoon collisions the vehicle velocities will still be close to the initial velocities but arranged in decreasing order. The work of <ref> [25, 53] </ref> and intuition from basic collision dynamics suggest that this is not an unrealistic assumption. <p> Following <ref> [25] </ref>, we can model the fact that the deceleration of the leader is limited by that of the followers by assuming that platoons follow each other at spacings of: s max = max A ;a min s L (x 0 where fl = 1; 1:05; 1:1; 1:15; 1:2 for N =

Reference-contexts: In the context of platooning, the issue of controller design and safety for platoon followers has been addressed extensively in [25]. For autonomous vehicles and platoon leaders a number of controllers have been proposed <ref> [26, 27, 28] </ref>, some without explicit safety guarantees. [29] highlighted problems, due primarily to the hybrid nature of the system, that may arise if such guarantees are not provided. <p> Therefore, to reduce the size of the continuous state space we introduce a variable D AB = x B x A L B to keep track of the spacing between vehicles A and B. Following <ref> [27] </ref>, we assume that (after feedback linearization) the controller of vehicle A can directly set the jerk u A = x A through brakes and accelerator actuators. <p> One possible design could make use of the saddle solution, (u fl 3 ; d fl 3 ), for cost function J 3 with u fl 3 2 U 2 (q; x); other designs like the ones in <ref> [27, 28] </ref> may be even more appropriate. To make sure the design is reasonable we will only assume that the desired steady state spacing satisfies (q 1 ; x d ) 2 int (V 1 ) and that the desired velocity v H is never exceeded. <p> These objectives can be achieved by a controller that switches between tracking spacing and tracking v H based on state information <ref> [27] </ref>. The resulting safe, comfortable and efficient controller can be implemented by a hybrid automaton (Figure 4). The controller automaton has no continuous state. <p> Clearly the rest of the controller design will have to be different, as the objectives of the two maneuvers differ. The design can be completed using the techniques outlined in Section 3 or by using other controllers proposed for this purpose in the literature <ref> [27, 28] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the assumed sensor arrangement is realistic for current technology. The calculations presented here easily generalize to vehicle models with sensing and actuation delays, lags and small additive noise <ref> [42] </ref>. We assume that the sensor ranges are large enough to maintain safety. The automaton describing the evolution of the pair A B has three discrete states q A 2 X D = fq 1 ; q 2 ; q 3 g and four continuous states. <p> With minimal changes the estimate can be refined to allow for sensing and actuation delays, safety margins and different information structures (e.g. vehicles estimating a min A on line) <ref> [42] </ref>. <p> Our results also indicate what pieces of information would improve performance. For example, it is easy to see that knowledge of the vehicles deceleration capability can greatly reduce the average following distance and hence increase throughput <ref> [42] </ref>. In our framework, the role of inter-agent coordination is to reduce the set of allowable disturbances. This has the effect of "biasing" the game in favor of the controller and hence increasing the range of conditions under which game winning controls exist and improving the overall system performance.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis will indicate that this requirement may be too restrictive in terms of throughput. Previous studies <ref> [43] </ref> suggest that collisions with small relative velocities are not likely to result in serious damage to the vehicles or injury to the passengers. <p> This motivates the following definition: Definition 6 A safe collision between two vehicles is one where the relative velocity at impact is less than a threshold, v a . An Automated Highway System where vehicles experience only safe collisions is called a safe AHS. Based on the analysis of <ref> [43] </ref>, we set v a = 3ms 1 in our calculations. For each vehicle we treat the controller design as a two player zero sum game between the vehicle controller, u, and the disturbance, d.

A crucial observation <ref> [45] </ref> (which can also be inferred from the calculations in this paper) is that, in the presence of differences in deceleration capability and/or sensing and actuation delays, collisions will be at low relative velocities if either the vehicles are far enough from one another (in which case they can come to

Reference-contexts: Platoons are separated by large spacings to avoid inter-platoon collisions. In addition to safety, the large inter-platoon spacing helps attenuate disturbances as they propagate down a string of platoons.

Reference-contexts: The trailing platoon decelerates to safe inter-platoon distance. The lane change maneuver is used to move a vehicle from one lane to another. Finally, the entry and exit maneuvers allow the vehicle to get on/off the automated highway. In <ref> [51] </ref> communication protocols were designed to implement the discrete aspects of these maneuvers. The protocols are in the form of finite state machines, a special class of hybrid automata with no continuous state. <p> Proof: By the properties of the saddle solution and the definitions of safe states and controls. 5.1.3 Lane Change, Entry and Exit Laws We assume the lane change policy of <ref> [51] </ref>, where a vehicle is a free agent both before and after the lane change. Assume free agent A wishes to move to the lane where platoons E and F are moving. The lane change can be decomposed in two phases. <p> The discussion in this section is informal and provides only the information necessary for stating and proving the platooning safety theorem. The discrete steps we assume are consistent with the protocols specified in <ref> [51] </ref> while the discrete/continuous interface aspects are consistent with the design of [55]. The formal analysis carried out in these two papers provides performance guarantees for the discrete dynamics of the system. <p> By abuse of notation, let A and B (Figure 2) represent platoons of M and N vehicles respectively and let x AB denote the distance between the leader of A and the last follower of B. Following <ref> [51] </ref> we assume all communication and coordination is handled by the platoon leader. First consider what happens when A joins B. The maneuver is initiated by A, whose leader checks that the platoon is not already engaged in another maneuver and that x AB 2 V J . <p> A similar argument indicates that a vehicle executing lane change maneuver (and consequently an entry or an exit) will not collide with the vehicle ahead of it. Note that the limitation of "one maneuver per vehicle at a time" imposed by the coordination layer <ref> [51] </ref> ensures that the front vehicle of a joining or splitting pair will be in the leader mode, while 5 By Assumption 4 A, . . . , H may in fact represent entire platoons. 20 the trailing vehicle will either be followed by a vehicle in the leader mode or

Reference-contexts: Some simplifying assumptions were made; for example, it was assumed that a platoon can only be engaged in one maneuver at a time and that only single vehicles (free agents) can change lanes. The performance of the proposed protocols was verified using COSPAN <ref> [52] </ref>, a finite state machine model checker. The verification concerned only discrete aspects of the protocol operation, such as absence of deadlocks.

Reference-contexts: Two platoons moving at slightly different speeds collide and become one platoon. If the intra-platoon spacing is small and Assumption 3 is satisfied, after a finite number of intra-platoon collisions the vehicle velocities will still be close to the initial velocities but arranged in decreasing order. The work of <ref> [25, 53] </ref> and intuition from basic collision dynamics suggest that this is not an unrealistic assumption.

Reference-contexts: In extreme cases the best response for vehicle A may also involve hard acceleration (in an attempt to keep up with vehicle B) followed by hard braking. These predictions were verified in <ref> [54] </ref> by numerical experiments. Unlike the leader and autonomous cases, the calculation of the safe sets and controls has to be done numerically in this case, as it is difficult to express the saddle solution in feedback form and solve the corresponding equations 4 .

In the presence of faults it is easy to construct scenarios where unsafe collisions are possible whatever the controller does [56]. A possible solution would be to introduce probabilistic analysis and require that the probability of unsafe collisions is small. Formulating such proofs will require considerable extension of our design methodology. Probabilistic analysis can also be used to produce less conservative "normal mode" controllers.
