Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, followed by automated segmentation of the corpus callosum (CC) in midsagittal sections have important applications in both clinical neurology and neurocognitive research since the size and shape of the CC are shown to be correlated to sex, age, neurodegenerative diseases and various lateralized behavior in man. Moreover, whole head, multispectral 3D MRI recordings enable voxel-based tissue classification and estimation of total brain volumes, in addition to CC morphometric parameters. We propose a new algorithm that uses both multispectral MRI measurements (intensity values) and prior information about shape (CC template) to segment CC in midsagittal slices with very little user interaction. The algorithm has been tested on a sample of 10 subjects scanned with multispec-tral 3D MRI, collected for a study of dyslexia, with very good agreement between the manually traced (true) CC outline and the detected CC outline. We conclude that the proposed method for CC segmentation is promising for clinical use when multispectral MR images are recorded.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Several studies indicate that the size and shape of the corpus callosum (CC) in human brain are correlated to sex <ref> [1, 7, 26] </ref>, age [26, 34], brain growth and degeneration [14, 21], handedness [5], and to various types of brain dysfunction [8, 9, 16, 25, 27]. <p> concludes the paper with a CVPR'99 #107 page 1/7 Submission 98/11/26 discussion of clinical applicability and possible improve-ments of the proposed method. 2 Previous Work Manual tracing of the CC boundary in midsagittal MR images seems to be the most frequently used method in clinical studies of CC morphometry (e.g., <ref> [1, 6, 14, 16] </ref>). Dynamic contour models have been used to segment various structures in the brain and other parts of the body imaged with MRI or X-ray CT (see, e.g., [22] for a survey).

Reference-contexts: Their methods require the user to mark points interactively on the segmented contour, and results were sensitive to the normalization procedure being used for shape parameterization regarding translation, rotation and scaling. An interactive live-wire boundary extraction method was proposed by Barrett & Mortensen <ref> [2] </ref>, where boundary detection is formulated as a graph searching problem. Their local cost function incorporates Laplacian zero-crossing, gradient magnitude and gradient direction, and the goal is to find the globally minimum cumulative cost path between a start node (pixel) and a set of goal nodes.

Reference-contexts: To compute the prototype, we first align the shapes from the training set into a common parameterization framework by selecting from every manual contour a subset of registered points of equal cardinality. This is achieved by performing a pair-wise alignment (using a least-squares type distance <ref> [3] </ref>) of a smoothed version of each shape to every original shape in the training set.

Reference-contexts: However, the method is CPU demanding and point correspondence between homologous points on each active contour is not guaranteed. Using the algorithm on midsagittal MR image from a sample of eight women and eight men, they found a greater splenial area in females than males. Bookstein <ref> [4] </ref> has recently introduced a combination of CVPR'99 #107 page 2/7 Submission 98/11/26 Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines for multivariate comparison of the shape outlines. The method was applied to the corpus callosum boundary in midsagittal MR images from 12 normals and from 13 patients with schizophrenia. <p> interest this was done at the shape matching stage where the learned CC prototype was warped to the eroded white matter segmentations. 4.3 Shape Matching and Final CC Segmentation Fig. 7 shows the Procrustes average of the 5 manually traced CC shapes with the scatter of fits (as defined in <ref> [4] </ref>) overlaid. Consecutive point clouds are drawn in different gray-levels to prove that the clouds are non-overlapping, that is, the registration is precise. Final segmentation results in 6 individuals from the sample are shown in Fig. 8.

Directly related to our application, Davatzikos and coworkers <ref> [7] </ref> proposed an elastic deformation transformation that normalizes corpus callosum into Talairach space [30]. The properties of this transformation was then used as a quantitative description of CC shape with respect to the Talairach atlas, providing a common reference system for intersubject comparisons. <p> The method was applied to the corpus callosum boundary in midsagittal MR images from 12 normals and from 13 patients with schizophrenia. Using his algorithm, he also reanalyzed the sample of 16 individuals reported in <ref> [7] </ref>, and found a statistically significant CC shape difference between the sexes, primarily a vertical extension of the splenium in females compared to males. 3 Proposed Method We use a combination of a bottom-up (multispectral contextual classification) and a top-down (shape-matching) approach to localize and segment the corpus callosum, illustrated in <p> This snake method has been shown to move snakes into boundary cavities which is a typical characteristic of the CC contour. Another method which should be compared with is the flexible Fourier contour model by Szekely and coworkers [29] and also the contour deformation method developed in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, due to iterative parameter updating and simulated annealing optimization the algorithm is slow. Moreover, since the fornix and the CC are connected structures, both representing white matter, their algorithm might not be suitable in our case. Duta & Sonka <ref> [10] </ref> designed a knowledge-based active shape procedure that incorporated a priori knowledge about the objects of interest and their specific structural relationships in order to provide robust segmentation and labeling. Their model was successfully used to identify ten neuroanatomic structures in MR brain images.

Reference-contexts: This is achieved by performing a pair-wise alignment (using a least-squares type distance [3]) of a smoothed version of each shape to every original shape in the training set. The alignment procedure, somewhat resemblant to that of Feldmar and Ayache <ref> [11] </ref>, first performs a global similarity registration of the two shapes, then refines it by applying a set of local alignments in a topological neighborhood (of each point) defined according to the natural point ordering along the contour.

Reference-contexts: Szekely et al. [29] segmented corpus callosum from gray-valued MRI images using constrained elastic deformations of a flexible Fourier contour model. The algorithm require selection of an anatomically defined reference coordinate system where the AC/PC line has to be determined manually. Ghanei and coworkers <ref> [12] </ref> segmented the hippocamus using a discrete contour representation and adaptive internal force weights. However, their method is dependent on manual placement of an initial polygon close to the target boundary. Further, several parameters need to be specified by the user.

Reference-contexts: The smoothed shape that has the smallest distance to the remaining ones (which can be considered a best fit to the training set) is used to extract from each training shape registered sets of corresponding points. Then, the mean shape is derived by Procrustes Analysis <ref> [13] </ref> applied to the previously extracted sets. The deformable template segmentation step tries to warp the learned CC prototype onto the edges of the image obtained by low-level classification. In order to achieve a fast segmentation, we do not use the entire edge map from the low-level classification image.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the model fitting was not accurate when applied to caudate nucleus or the hippocam-pus.

The two-stage algorithm, formulated in a Bayesian framework, combines multispectral tissue signal intensities and anatomical shape information.

To eliminate the need for uniformity of head position at the time of imaging, Semrud-Clikeman et al. <ref> [27] </ref> acquired T1-weighted 3D-SPGR images which were reformatted into a positionally normalized sagittal scan using proper rigid-body translation and rotation and subsequent re-slicing into 1.0 mm sagittal slices prior to morphometric analysis. Although our segmentation results are excellent, the set of processed images is small.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic contour models have been used to segment various structures in the brain and other parts of the body imaged with MRI or X-ray CT (see, e.g., [22] for a survey). Staib & Duncan <ref> [28] </ref> introduced a probabilistic deformable model, based on the elliptic Fourier decomposition of the boundary, to segment the endocardium and the epicardium boundaries of the left ventricle in cardiac MR images and the boundary of the corpus callosum in midsagittal MR images.

Reference-contexts: They succeeded in delineating the CC structure using six harmonics, but their direct search optimization method was slow and the final CC contour was visually inaccurate. Szekely et al. <ref> [29] </ref> segmented corpus callosum from gray-valued MRI images using constrained elastic deformations of a flexible Fourier contour model. The algorithm require selection of an anatomically defined reference coordinate system where the AC/PC line has to be determined manually. <p> This snake method has been shown to move snakes into boundary cavities which is a typical characteristic of the CC contour. Another method which should be compared with is the flexible Fourier contour model by Szekely and coworkers <ref> [29] </ref> and also the contour deformation method developed in [7].

Reference-contexts: Their model was successfully used to identify ten neuroanatomic structures in MR brain images. Directly related to our application, Davatzikos and coworkers [7] proposed an elastic deformation transformation that normalizes corpus callosum into Talairach space <ref> [30] </ref>. The properties of this transformation was then used as a quantitative description of CC shape with respect to the Talairach atlas, providing a common reference system for intersubject comparisons.

The numbers of clusters were selected to match the expected number of normal tissue types present in the imaged anatomy. To reduce the number of voxels to be clustered, a mask was drawn manually around the central part of the head.

Reference-contexts: We also use multivari-ate normal densities f k with tissue specific mean vectors and covariance matrices, since this model is simple and is shown to be reasonable in other MRI recordings from the brain <ref> [32] </ref>. Since the classification result is used only to guide the initial contour of the deformable model, no doubt or outlier options were used. <p> page 3/7 Submission 98/11/26 Training Technique To obtain tissue-specific parame-ter estimates (mean values and covariance matrices of the class-conditional densities), we used K-means partitional clustering [17] of the voxels in a single 2D slice recorded in one of the subjects with subsequent manual labeling of the K = 9 clusters <ref> [31, 32] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The method enables fast detection of the outer boundary of the brain in MRI, but requires intensive user interaction and suffers from some degree of intra-observer and inter-observer variability. Vemuri et al. <ref> [33] </ref> have developed fast numerical algorithms for fitting multiresolution hybrid shape models to brain MRI. Their shape model is described globally as a deformable superquadric geometry in a wavelet basis and locally by a triangular finite-element discretization, where fitting is regarded as an energy minimization problem.
