Abstract: This study explored touchscreen keyboards using high precision touchscreen strategies. Phase one evaluated three possible monitor positions: 30, 45, and 75 degrees from horizontal. Results indicate that the 75 degree angle, approximately the standard monitor position, resulted in more fatigue and lower preference ratings. Phase two collected touch bias and key size data for the 30 degree angle. Subjects consistently touched below targets, and touched to the left of targets on either side of the screen. Using these data, a touchscreen keyboard was designed. Phase three compared this keyboard with a mouse activated keyboard, and the standard QWERTY keyboard for typing relatively short strings of 6, 19, and 44 characters. Results indicate that users can type approximately 25 words per minute with the touchscreen keyboard, compared to 17 WPM using the mouse, and 58 WPM when using the keyboard. Possible improvements to touchscreen keyboards are suggested.

Reference-contexts: This made it impossible for users to rest their fingers on the screen, or the home row, and overlapping touches could not be recognized, forcing a short delay between touches. Capacitive touchscreens have been reported to be the slowest technology, compounding this problem <ref> (Carroll Touch, 1989) </ref>. A technology that responds to touches more rapidly, or that allows the identification of simultaneous touches, even as few as two, may increase data entry rates. The slow response rate is suspected of being a major limit for the typing rate.

Reference-contexts: However, reducing the size of the keyboard may result in slower typing times when using a touchscreen.

Additional studies may investigate using smaller touchscreen keyboards, various keyboard layouts, keys shapes and sizes, or various types of feedback. There are many potential improvements to touchscreen keyboards that may increase data entry speeds, reduce errors, reduce screen consumption, and improve user satisfaction.
