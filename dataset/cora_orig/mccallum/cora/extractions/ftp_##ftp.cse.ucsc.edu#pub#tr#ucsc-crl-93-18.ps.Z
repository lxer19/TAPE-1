Abstract: We have proposed an efficient measure to reduce the clock skew by assigning the clock network with variable branch widths. This measure has long been used for "H" clock tree. This paper formulates the optimal sizing of a general clock network as an optimization problem which minimizes the clock skew in a feasible set of widths. This feasible set of branch widths is decided by the process technology and routing resources. The skew minimization problem is turned into a least-squares estimation problem, and a modified Gauss-Marquardt's method is then used to determine the optimal widths of clock branches. This optimization method combines the best features of the methods based on Taylor series and methods based on gradients. An efficient algorithm is also proposed that assigns the good initial widths especially for a clock tree which let the later optimization process converge much more quickly. Our method is very flexible and can handle the general clock network including loops. The clock network can exhibit distributed RC and lossy transmission line behaviors. The method employs a scattering-parameters based delay macromodel to evaluate the timing of the clock network during the optimization process. The major objective of our sizing method is to minimize the skew, but as a by-product that the largest path delay is also reduced.

Reference-contexts: Clock skew has been identified as one of major limiting factors for high speed synchronous VLSI systems in sub-micron ICs and multi-chip modules. The "H" clock tree is widely used in the IC industry <ref> [2] </ref>. However, it is only applicable for symmetric arrays of logic elements. Some research work has been done involving the construction of a clock tree based on the general distribution of clock terminals. <p> The Elmore delay model or simpler linear delay model used in the previous methods is not enough for high speed interconnects which exhibit distributed RC behaviors in IC chips or transmission line effects in multi-chip modules <ref> [2] </ref>. Furthermore, all the previous methods assume the clock network to be tree topology. But in the IC industry, clock networks with loops such as clock meshes are often used [19]. <p> The clock network usually crosses the whole VLSI system with long wires and large loads. With the increase of chip size and especially for the substrate of multi-chip modules, the clock network will be modeled as transmission line when the clock frequency increases <ref> [2] </ref>. To minimize the clock skew, the sizing should be performed on a good topology of clock network, since the topology decides the branch lengths and the network structure. <p> To minimize the clock skew, the sizing should be performed on a good topology of clock network, since the topology decides the branch lengths and the network structure.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the modeling of the clock network should take into consideration of the effect of vias and variable parameters of different layers. The current density requirement due to electromigration sometimes also should be taken into consideration for a large size clock network <ref> [3] </ref>. The required current density provides a lower bound for the width of each branch. This lower bound of the branch can be specified in the constraints when doing the optimization. 8 Acknowledgement This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award under Grant MIP-9009945.

The comparison results are shown in Table 6.4 on the above examples in the case of 1m IC chips by using the DME algorithm <ref> [8] </ref> and our optimal sizing method (OSM). The DME algorithm cannot handle Example 1 with loops. The OSM method obtains the better results than DME's both in the clock skew and the largest path delay for other examples.

Reference-contexts: The constraints shown in (2.2) constitute a feasible set where the optimum solution is located. We turn the clock skew minimization problem into a least-squares estimation problem. We use an efficient optimization method <ref> [17] </ref> to achieve the optimal widths of clock branches.

The other method is based on the modifications of the steepest-descent method. <p> While the methods based on Taylor series suffer from the possible divergence of the successive iterates, the steepest-descent based methods may have a very slow convergence of the optimum solution after the first few rapid iterations.

Reference-contexts: To obtain the sensitivity matrix J, one needs to get the sensitivity of error g i at each terminal t i with respect to all branch widths. These sensitivities are computed by numerical differentiation method <ref> [18] </ref>. Numerical differentiation is applicable to a complex clock network which may have loops and is based on distributed RC and transmission line models. The iteration continues until the skew is less than a prescribed value, or required iterations exceed.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, all the previous methods assume the clock network to be tree topology. But in the IC industry, clock networks with loops such as clock meshes are often used <ref> [19] </ref>. The clock network can be assigned with variable widths on wires to reduce the skew, which is also often used in the industry. By adjusting widths of clock wires, the electrical parameters such as resistance, capacitance and inductance associated with a clock wire will be changed.
