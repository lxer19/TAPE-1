Abstract: We develop an analytical delay model based on first and second moments to incorporate inductance effects into the delay estimate for interconnection lines. Delay estimates using our analytical model are within 15% of SPICE-computed delay across a wide range of interconnect parameter values. We also extend our delay model for estimation of source-sink delays in arbitrary interconnect trees. For the small tree topology considered, we observe improvements of at least 18% in the accuracy of delay estimates when compared to the Elmore model (which is independent of inductance), even though our estimates are as easy to compute as Elmore delay. The speedup of delay estimation via our analytical model is several orders of magnitude when compared to a simulation methodology such as SPICE.

Reference-contexts: Transient simulation of lossy interconnects based on convolution techniques is presented in [8, 12]. Faster techniques based on moment computations are proposed in [11, 16, 17]. Since these methods are too expensive to be used during iterative layout optimization, the Elmore delay <ref> [2] </ref> approximation (which represents the first moment of the transfer function) is now widely used in the performance-driven design of clock distribution and Steiner global routing topologies. <p> Efficient delay estimates for RC lines are typically derived by considering a single interconnect line with resistive source and capacitive load impedances; delay formulas for an interconnect tree entail recursive application of the formula for a single line. The analytical Elmore delay <ref> [2] </ref> estimate, Sakurai's heuristic delay formula [14, 15] and the single pole delay estimates of [3] have been widely used. * Elmore delay is defined to be the first moment of the system impulse response, i.e., the coefficient of s or the first moment in the system transfer function H (s).

The single pole of the transfer function is equal to the inverse of the Elmore delay T ED . Hence, the delay at arbitrary thresholds of the single-pole response can be directly related to Elmore delay (Elmore delay corresponds to the 63:2% threshold delay of the single-pole response).

Hence, for the case of complex poles (i.e., underdamped response), the Elmore model is no longer acceptably accurate. As detailed in <ref> [6] </ref>, we have also considered the special case in which poles are equal, i.e., a double pole configuration.
