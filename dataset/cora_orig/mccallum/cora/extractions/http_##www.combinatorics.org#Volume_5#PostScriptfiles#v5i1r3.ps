Abstract: A set S of positive integers has distinct subset sums if there are 2 jSj dis tinct elements of the set P . Let f(n) = minfmax S : jSj = n and S has distinct subset sumsg. Erd-os conjectured f(n) c2 n for some constant c. We give a construction that yields f(n) &lt; 0:22002 2 n for n suffi ciently large. This now stands as the best known upper bound on f(n).

Reference-contexts: In particular, he conjectured that f (n) c2 n for some constant c, and he offered $500 for settling this conjecture [E1] [G1] [G2]. In 1955 Erd-os and Moser proved that f (n) 2 n =(4 p n) [E2] (for a proof using the second moment method see <ref> [AS, p47] </ref>). This remains, up to the constant, the best known lower bound (for an improvement in the constant see [Elk]). The only improvements on the trivial upper bound on f (n) have been by construction.

Reference-contexts: We should note that these aren't the only known constructions for a set of n integers with distinct subset sums and largest element smaller than the trivial 2 n1 , but they are the constructions that give the best bounds on f (n) (for some other constructions see [L],[M] and <ref> [ANS] </ref>). In this paper we construct a family of sequences of sets of integers which contains all five of the sequences mentioned above. We go on to prove that all sets from each of the sequences have distinct subset sums.

Reference-contexts: This is a sequence of sets of integers that John Conway and Richard Guy constructed in 1967. They showed that the first 40 sets from this sequence have distinct subset sums. The 40 th set gives f (n) &lt; :23513 2 n for n 40 [G1] [G2] <ref> [CG] </ref>. This stood as the best upper bound on f (n) until the mid 1980's when Fred Lunnon conducted a computational investigation of this problem. Lunnon found four sequences of sets of integers that beat the Conway-Guy sequence.
