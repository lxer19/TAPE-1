Reference-contexts: An approach where triggers are automatically derived from a declarative constraint specification is illustrated in <ref> [CFPT92a] </ref>. The approach considers a possible interaction with the constraint designer to guide the decision process. In that approach we distinguish two phases: first repairing rules are generated from declaratively defined constraints, then a subset of these rules is selected. <p> This situation causes cycles that may 7 produce a nonterminating rule-system. A conservative static analysis identifies rules of this kind that are not selected. In <ref> [CFPT92a] </ref> the constraint language is more restricted than the one of Chimera and the data model is simply relational.

Reference-contexts: order to provide integrity checking, it is sufficient to automatically generate one abort rule for each integrity constraint, with the following syntax-directed translation. * The event part is given by the set of database updates that can introduce violations of the constraint, which can be exhaustively identified at compile-time (see <ref> [CFPT92b] </ref> and [CW90] in the context of relational databases; the extension of such methods to Chimera is trivial); * The condition part is identical to the body of the declaratively defined constraint; * The action part consists of a single rollback command.

Reference-contexts: Such encoding of constraints into triggers was originally introduced in [CW90] for relational databases. In the rest of this paper, each of the three levels is considered in a separate section. 2 Declarative Specification of Constraints Chimera <ref> [CM93] </ref> is a novel database language which integrates an object-oriented data model, a declarative query language based on deductive rules, and an active rule language for reactive processing 1 .

Reference-contexts: We call them maintenance rules and provide Chimera users with adequate tools to support their generation from declarative constraints and their analysis for termination and correctness (ability to achieve a consistent state for any input transaction). Such encoding of constraints into triggers was originally introduced in <ref> [CW90] </ref> for relational databases. <p> Each constraint is defined by a name, a list of typed output parameters and a body. The body is a condition that should not hold in any database instance (thus Chimera constraints have a negative semantics, as e.g., in <ref> [CW90] </ref>). The output parameters are a subset of the free variables that appear in the constraint body. If the evaluation of the body yields a non-empty set of bindings for these variables, these bindings are passed to the output parameters. <p> provide integrity checking, it is sufficient to automatically generate one abort rule for each integrity constraint, with the following syntax-directed translation. * The event part is given by the set of database updates that can introduce violations of the constraint, which can be exhaustively identified at compile-time (see [CFPT92b] and <ref> [CW90] </ref> in the context of relational databases; the extension of such methods to Chimera is trivial); * The condition part is identical to the body of the declaratively defined constraint; * The action part consists of a single rollback command.

Reference-contexts: Constraints are essentially set-oriented deductive rules integrated with object management. Differently from other approaches <ref> [GJ91] </ref>, constraints are not treated as first-class objects; they may be defined in the context of a single class of Chimera in which case they are called targeted constraints or instead be defined in the context of multiple classes in which case they are called untargeted constraints.
