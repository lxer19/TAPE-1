Abstract: The discovery of general patterns and their subsequent explanation is a familiar method in linguistics and other cross-cultural research. This paper addresses the computerized discovery of significant cultural and linguistic patterns, specifically implicational universals. We dispute published suggestions that the mechanical generation of universals is inadvisable, by arguing that such claims confuse the discovery of a pattern with its explanation. We propose a principled method that uses permutation tests to estimate whether the discovered universals are significant. Finally, these methods are used to mine the rich kinship dataset contributed by G.P. Murdock in 1970, and to report eleven universals found therein.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, some checks should be applied to the collection of universals, whether the universals are generated humanly or by machine. A good way to get an idea of the chances for seemingly significant patterns is to carry out a permutation test <ref> [3] </ref> on the data. The logic is this: suppose one has some method for discovering patterns along with some measure of pattern strength. Given a tabular dataset in which the rows correspond to the examples and the columns to the features, randomly permute the values in every column.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The discovery of patterned (non-random) phenomena and their subsequent explanation is a familiar method in linguistics and other cross-cultural research. Hurford, for instance, cites a number of examples from the contemporary literature <ref> [7, p 59] </ref>. The method has even earlier antecedents, since one of the great discoveries in linguistics the hypothesis of the Indo-European language family was invoked to explain the parallels among Sanskrit and European languages.

Reference-contexts: Section 3 suggests a principled method that uses permutation tests to estimate whether the discovered universals are significant. Finally, in Section 4 we mine the rich kinship dataset contributed by G.P. Murdock in a 1970 Ethnology article <ref> [8] </ref>, which to our knowledge has been insufficiently exploited, and list the significant universals contained in these kinship data. 2. Mechanical Generation of Universals In his book Typology and Universals [2, p 50], Croft cites the following example due to J. Greenberg (taken presumably from [5, p 50]). <p> White developed the idea in the context of dichotomous features, but the technique is equally applicable to categorical data having multiple values, as we will show here with the Murdock data on kinship patterns. 4. Universals of Kinship Patterns The Murdock dataset <ref> [8] </ref> describes the terminological classification system of eight sets of kin (grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces (male speaker), siblings, cross-cousins, and siblings-in-law) for 566 societies from 194 of the 200 cultural provinces that Murdock had isolated. This dataset is the most representative compilation of kinship terminologies to date.

Reference-contexts: The significance test based on permutations should be delegated to a program in any case, trivial or not. Parenthetically, we do not concede that "mechanical" (computerized) methods are inca 2 pable of explanatory reasoning; counterexamples could be adduced from other sciences, e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>. Our pragmatic aim is to accelerate research in cross-cultural typology by developing computerized discovery aids. 3.
