Abstract: In recent years, a number of different semantics for defaults have been proposed, such as preferential structures, *- semantics, possibilistic structures, and -rankings, that have been shown to be characterized by the same set of axioms, known as the KLM properties (for Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor). While this was viewed as a surprise, we show here that it is almost inevitable. We do this by giving yet another semantics for defaults that uses plausibility measures, a new approach to modeling uncertainty that generalize other approaches, such as probability measures, belief functions, and possibility measures. We show that all the earlier approaches to default reasoning can be embedded in the framework of plausibility. We then provide a necessary and sufficient condition on plausibilities for the KLM properties to be sound, and an additional condition necessary and sufficient for the KLM properties to be complete. These conditions are easily seen to hold for all the earlier approaches, thus explaining why they are characterized by the KLM properties.

It also points out the advantage of using plausibility measures as a semantics for defaults.

Reference-contexts: by a collection of axioms that have been called the KLM properties (since they were discussed in (Kraus, Lehmann, & Magidor 1990)), and many of the recent approaches to default reasoning, including preferential structures (Kraus, Lehmann, & Magidor 1990; Shoham 1987), *-semantics (Adams 1975; Geffner 1992b; Pearl 1989), possibilistic structures <ref> (Dubois & Prade 1991) </ref>, and -rankings (Goldszmidt & Pearl 1992; Spohn 1987), have been shown to be characterized by these properties. This has been viewed as somewhat surprising, since these approaches seem to capture quite different intuitions.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this paper is to explain why all these approaches are characterized by the KLM properties. Our key tool is the use of yet another approach for giving semantics to defaults, that makes use of plausibility measures <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1995a) </ref>. A plausibility measure associates with a set a plausibility, which is just an element in a partially ordered space. The only property that we require is that the plausibility of a set is at least as great as the plausibility of any of its subsets. <p> This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the relevant material from <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1995a) </ref> on plausibility measures. In Section 3, we review the KLM properties and various approaches to default reasoning that are characterized by these properties. <p> These orderings cannot be captured precisely because of the additional structure. Moreover, as we shall see, by starting with very little structure and adding just what we need, we can sometimes bring to light issues that may be obscured in richer frameworks. We refer the interested reader to <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1995a) </ref> for a more detailed comparison to (Darwiche 1992; Weydert 1994). 3 Approaches to Default Reasoning: A Review Defaults are statements of the form if ' then typically/likely/by default , which we denote '! . For example, the default birds typically fly is represented Bird!Fly. <p> Beyond their role in default reasoning, we expect that plausibility measures will prove useful whenever we want to express uncertainty and do not want to (or cannot) do so using probability. For example, we can easily define a plau-sibilistic analogue of conditioning <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1995a) </ref>. While this can also be done in many of the other approaches we have considered, we believe that the generality of plausibility structures will allow us to again see what properties of independence we need for various tasks.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There have been many approaches to default reasoning proposed in the literature (see (Ginsberg 1987; Gabbay, Hogger, & Robinson 1993) for overviews). The recent literature has been guided by a collection of axioms that have been called the KLM properties (since they were discussed in <ref> (Kraus, Lehmann, & Magidor 1990) </ref>), and many of the recent approaches to default reasoning, including preferential structures (Kraus, Lehmann, & Magidor 1990; Shoham 1987), *-semantics (Adams 1975; Geffner 1992b; Pearl 1989), possibilistic structures (Dubois & Prade 1991), and -rankings (Goldszmidt & Pearl 1992; Spohn 1987), have been shown to be characterized <p> While there has been little consensus on what the right semantics for defaults should be, there has been some consensus on a reasonable core of inference rules for default reasoning. This core, known as the KLM properties, was suggested by <ref> (Kraus, Lehmann, & Magidor 1990) </ref>, and consists of the following axiom and rules of inference (where we use ) to denote material implication): LLE. From ' , ' 0 and '! infer ' 0 ! (left logical equivalence) RW. <p> CM states that if 1 and 2 are two default conclusions of ', then discovering that 1 holds when ' holds (as would be expected, given the default) should not cause us to retract the default conclusion 2 . This system of rules is called system P in <ref> (Kraus, Lehmann, & Magidor 1990) </ref>. The notation ` P '! denotes that '! can be deduced from using these inference rules. There are a number of well-known semantics for defaults that are characterized by these rules. <p> What do we do in these structures? There are a number of options: the first is to assume that, for each formula ', there are minimal worlds in [[']]; this is the assumption actually made in <ref> (Kraus, Lehmann, & Magidor 1990) </ref>, where it is called the smoothness assumption. A yet more general definitionone that works even if is not smoothis given in (Lewis 1973; Boutilier 1994). Roughly speaking, '! is true if, from a certain point on, whenever ' is true, so is .

Reference-contexts: We say that a knowledge base rationally entails '! , denoted j= r '! , if every rational structure that satisfies also satisfies '! . 3 Theorem 3.2: <ref> (Lehmann & Magidor 1992) </ref> j= r '! if and only if ` P '! . Thus, we do not gain any new patterns of default inference when we restrict our attention to rational structures.

Reference-contexts: In Section 6, we discuss how plausibility measures can be used to give semantics to a full logic of conditionals, and compare this with the more traditional approach <ref> (Lewis 1973) </ref>. In the full paper (Friedman & Halpern 1995b) we also consider the relationship between our approach to plausibility and epistemic entrenchment (G ardenfors & Makinson 1988). <p> Formulas can describe logical combination of defaults (e.g., (p!q) _ (p!:q)) as well as nested defaults (e.g., (p!q)!r). The semantics of conditional logic is similar to the semantics of defaults. 9 The usual definition <ref> (Lewis 1973) </ref> associates with each world a preferential order over worlds. We now give a similar definition based on plausibility measures. Given a preferential structure PL = (W; Pl; ), we define what it means for a formula ' to be true at a world w in PL. <p> Clearly we need axioms and inference rules that generalize those of system P. Let N ' be an abbreviation for :'!false. (This operator is called the outer modality in <ref> (Lewis 1973) </ref>.) Expanding the definition of !, we get that N ' holds at w if and only if Pl ([[:']]) =?. Thus, N ' holds if :' is considered completely implausible. Thus, it implies that ' is true almost everywhere. <p> Note that if ' does not contain occurrences of !then this definition is equivalent to the one we gave earlier. Again, we omit the subscript when it is clear from the context. general definition of conditional logic <ref> (Lewis 1973) </ref>) then we would not need this axiom. There is no KLM property analogous to C5 since a formula such as N ('! ) involves nested !'s. It is well known (Lewis 1973; Burgess 1981; Friedman & Halpern 1994) that system C captures reasoning in preferential structures.

Reference-contexts: This explains why the KLM axioms characterize default reasoning in all these frameworks. Far from being surprising that the KLM axioms are complete in all these cases, it is almost inevitable. The KLM properties have been viewed as the conservative core of default reasoning <ref> (Pearl 1989) </ref>, and much recent effort has been devoted to finding principled methods of going beyond KLM. Our result shows that any approach that gives semantics to defaults with respect to a collection P of structures will almost certainly not go beyond KLM. <p> structure is a 3 Rational entailment should not be confused with the notion of rational closure, also defined by Lehmann and Magidor. 4 We adopt the presentation used in (Goldszmidt, Morris, & Pearl 1993). 5 Geffner's result is stated in terms of the original formulation of *-entailment, as described in <ref> (Pearl 1989) </ref>.
