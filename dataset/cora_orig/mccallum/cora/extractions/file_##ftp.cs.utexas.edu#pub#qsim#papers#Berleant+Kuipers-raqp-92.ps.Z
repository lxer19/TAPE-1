Title: Qualitative-Numeric Simulation with Q3  
Author: Daniel Berleant and Benjamin Kuipers In Boi Faltings and Peter Struss 
Note: (Eds.), Recent Advances in Quali tative Physics, MIT Press, 1992, pages 3-16. 1 Overview These points are demonstrated in an implemented qualitative-numeric simulator, Q3. 1 2 Introduction  
Abstract: A simulation contains a sequence of predicted states of a modeled system. A qualitative-numeric simulation is one containing both qualitative and quantitative state information, such that the qualitative information alone would be a qualitative simulation, and the quantitative information alone would be a numerical simulation. Qualitative-numeric simulation is thus a generalization of both qualitative simulation and numerical simulation, providing a framework for viewing historically disparate genres of simulation. Qualitative-numeric simulation also holds promise as an applied technique. Since it is a generalization of numerical simulation it has useful properties associated with numerical simulation that qualitative simulation does not have, like numerical predictions. And as a generalization of qualitative simulation, it has useful properties of qualitative simulation not present in numerical simulation, like dealing with weakly defined models, and automatically making qualitative distinctions among device behaviors and among model variable values. Simulation of models to predict behavior of real systems has a long history and much practical use. Discrete event simulation, used e.g. in computer engineering, simulates models whose state variables change discontinuously. Simulation of continuous systems also has a history of practical use, usually coming under the heading of numerical methods. Combined simulation refers to simulations containing both discrete and continuous changes in state.

Reference-contexts: Constraint propagation with interval labels was examined by Davis [DAVI87]. When doing the propagation, each value is expressed as an interval arithmetic 2 expression in terms of the other values of the constraint. This expression is evaluated using the rules of interval arithmetic (e.g. Moore [MOOR79; Alefeld and Herzberger <ref> [ALHE83] </ref>). The result is intersected with the current label, and the intersection assigned as the new label. Davis [DAVI87] argues that constraint propagation with interval labels is correct. For more rigorous proofs see e.g. Cooper [COOP89] and Berleant [BERL90].

Reference-contexts: Ability to infer more about behavior is the reason for inserting new states. For a very simple example described in much greater detail see Berleant <ref> [BERL89] </ref>. The improvement can be dramatic, as in figure 5b compared with 5a. Although an inserted state can only numerically describe a value for one model variable when it is inserted, any variable is potentially eligible, not just time. <p> Therefore when there are more states there are more constraint 10 instantiations ([Berleant <ref> [BERL89] </ref>).

Davis [DAVI87] argues that constraint propagation with interval labels is correct. For more rigorous proofs see e.g. Cooper [COOP89] and Berleant <ref> [BERL90] </ref>. Quantitative inferences may lead to higher level conclusions such as ruling out behaviors and making predictions about values (Kuipers and Berleant [KUBE88], also illustrated in figure 1. 2 Intervals are a full spectrum representation, because they can represent along a continuous spectrum from qualitative values to numbers. <p> Most of the inferred values are also numbers, the narrowest possible intervals. Figure 4 shows one of the model variables of figure 3 plotted using a constant scale. 6 The implausibility condition is actually required of constraints used to do Waltz filtering with any kind of label (Berleant <ref> [BERL90] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: One is showing that, like the Runge-Kutta technique, convergence occurs as the step size approaches zero, assuming 4 If there are no gaps anywhere in the simulation in which to insert a new state, it would be necessary to use the technique of case splitting (Berleant and Kuipers <ref> [BEKU90] </ref>. 5 The correctness of numerical inferences assumes that arithmetic operations on the machine are correct. In practice, they are not; round-off error is a subject in numerical analysis. <p> Therefore when there are more states there are more constraint 10 instantiations ([Berleant [BERL89]). A theoretical convergence result (Berleant and Kuipers <ref> [BEKU90] </ref>) shows that for many simulations, intervals can be narrowed all the way to numbers in the limit as step size approaches 0. 5 Conclusions Previous work on combining qualitative simulation with quantitative information has produced ways of mediating between the qualitative and the quantitative domains.

Reference-contexts: This insertion process is a type of adaptive discretization which we call step-size refinement.

Reference-contexts: Such constraints, determined by the model and behavior, are used to filter intervals containing the possible quantitative values of the qualitative values constrained by the instantiation. Constraint propagation with interval labels was examined by Davis <ref> [DAVI87] </ref>. When doing the propagation, each value is expressed as an interval arithmetic 2 expression in terms of the other values of the constraint. This expression is evaluated using the rules of interval arithmetic (e.g. Moore [MOOR79; Alefeld and Herzberger [ALHE83]). <p> This expression is evaluated using the rules of interval arithmetic (e.g. Moore [MOOR79; Alefeld and Herzberger [ALHE83]).

Unfortunately, cycles occur when intervals that were narrowed once before become narrowed again and again. This can lead to non-termination. Luckily non-termination is not hard to prevent, although halting computation means not finding the narrowest possible intervals (Davis <ref> [DAVI87] </ref>). to the qualitative-numeric simulation of figure 2 are replaced by single numbers that are the midpoints of the intervals of the initial conditions of figure 2. Comparing the two figures, it is clear that the inferred intervals tend to be markedly narrower when the initial conditions are single numbers.

These works succeeded in integrating quantitative and qualitative information to a significant degree. In most cases, however, qualitative and quantitative knowledge was maintained in distinct representations. <p> By adding quantitative information, even incomplete quantitative information, quantitative inferences may be made about various qualitative values in a simulation (figure 1). These inferences are done by constraint propagation among model variable value ( (Kuipers and Berleant <ref> [KUBE88] </ref>). For example, one of the air conditioner constraints is ((mult R HFin dTemp)), which declares that multiplying the Resistance of the dwelling to heat flow in or out, by the Heat Flow in rate occurring despite that resistance, equals dtemp, the temperature difference between inside and outside. <p> Davis [DAVI87] argues that constraint propagation with interval labels is correct. For more rigorous proofs see e.g. Cooper [COOP89] and Berleant [BERL90]. Quantitative inferences may lead to higher level conclusions such as ruling out behaviors and making predictions about values (Kuipers and Berleant <ref> [KUBE88] </ref>, also illustrated in figure 1. 2 Intervals are a full spectrum representation, because they can represent along a continuous spectrum from qualitative values to numbers. For example, a qualitative value of "+" corresponds to (0; 1). <p> the values of more than one variable is making an assertion about the model state that wasn't already implicitly there. 3 However, numerical information about the other model variables in the inserted state is usually inferable from model constraints and surrounding states, using the inference method of Kuipers and Berleant <ref> [KUBE88] </ref>. When inference is completed, the intervals bounding the values of many of the model variables in the various states of the simulation will have been narrowed. This constitutes 3 Specifying more than one value in a newly inserted state is valid if the values form a measurement.
