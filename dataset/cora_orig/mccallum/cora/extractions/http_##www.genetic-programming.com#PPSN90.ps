Abstract: This paper describes the application of the recently developed "genetic programming" paradigm to the problem of concept formation and decision tree induction. This paper describes the recently developed "genetic programming" paradigm which genetically breeds populations of computer programs to solve problems. In genetic programming, the individuals in the population are hierarchical compositions of functions and arguments of various sizes and shapes. Genetic algorithms are highly parallel mathematical algorithms that transform populations of individual mathematical objects (typically fixed-length binary character strings) into new populations using operations patterned after (1) natural genetic operations such as sexual recombination (crossover) and (2) fitness proportionate reproduction (Darwinian survival of the fittest). Genetic algorithms begin with an initial population of individuals (typically randomly generated) and then iteratively (1) evaluate the individuals in the population for fitness with respect to the problem environment and (2) perform genetic operations on various individuals in the population to produce a new population. John Holland of the University of Michigan presented the pioneering formulation of genetic algorithms for fixed-length character strings in Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems (Holland 1975).
