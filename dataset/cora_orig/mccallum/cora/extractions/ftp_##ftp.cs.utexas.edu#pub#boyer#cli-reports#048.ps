Reference-contexts: However, the FM8502 is a simple perturbation of the FM8501 design except for the inclusion of a new ALU design. This paper does not contain any significant new results, it simply presents the FM8502, as this machine provides the basis for the CLI short stack <ref> [BevierHuntYoung 87] </ref>. The FM8502 was created in 1987, to provide J Moore with a more suitable target vehicle for his verified assembly language Piton. 3 demonstrates the correctness of the FM8502 design. The instruction-level specification computes the next programmer state as a function of the present state in one step.
