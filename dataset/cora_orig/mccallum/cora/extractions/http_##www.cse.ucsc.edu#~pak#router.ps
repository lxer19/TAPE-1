Abstract: In this article we describe our experience and progress in accelerating an FPGA router. Placement and routing is undoubtly the most time-consuming process in automatic chip design or configuring programmable logic devices as reconfigurable computing elements. Our goal is to accelerate routing of FPGAs by 10 fold with a combination of workstation clusters and hardware acceleration. Coarse-grain parallelism is exploited by having several processors route separate groups of nets in parallel. A hardware accelerator is presented which exploits the fine-grain parallelism in routing individual nets.

Reference-contexts: Hence, routing acceleration has focussed primarily on implementing at least some of the search in hardware. In maze routing, the target graph is a grid from which some vertices and edges have been removed to represent obstacles <ref> [1, 4, 3] </ref>. Previous approaches to routing acceleration have exploited the regularity of the grid and parallelism in the propagation of possible routes from a source [6, 7]. An exception is Locusroute which is a global router for standard cell [5].

Reference-contexts: PathFinder is a negotiation-based router for FPGAs <ref> [2] </ref>. Figure 1 contains a sketch of the original Pathfinder algorithm used to find routes for the nets. In each iteration, PathFinder routes signals one at the time. In the first iteration, signals are allowed to share routing resources. <p> Its authors have demonstrated the strength of this router by a direct comparison with the Xilinx router APR <ref> [2] </ref>. We reinforce this point by showing the results of both routers on two pathological designs for XC3090s in Table 1. In essence, PathFinder is able to complete two difficult-to-route designs while the vendor's router cannot. Table 1 also reveals that PathFinder is very demanding computation-wise.

Locusroute distributes the signal nets among several processors using a shared memory and sacrifices the router's performance in terms of routing tracks to allow multiprocessing.
