Title: Eun-Jin Im and Allison Woodruff An Examination of Information Retrieval Traffic on a Campus  
Author: Backbone 
Note: Motivation  
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of TCP and IP traffic monitored on the University of California, Berkeley campus backbone. TCP connection-level data is analyzed to show the distribution of bytes, seconds, and connections among protocols. The connection-level data also shows the request/response, topological, and hourly distribution profiles of these protocols. IP packet-level data is analyzed to show the distribution of bytes and packets among protocols. Data regarding packet length for the protocols is also discussed. The analysis focusses on two primary issues, the amount of traffic related to emerging IR protocols such as gopher and WAIS and the characteristics of this traffic. Our study shows that these protocols account for a small amount of TCP traffic: 7 percent of total connections established and 3 percent of total bytes transferred. These IR protocols are characterized by short, small connections, in contrast to protocols such as telnet which have long, large connections. Our study also shows that TCP traffic accounts for approximately half of the bytes transferred by IP traffic, and that IR protocols have a tendency to have large packets, again in contrast to protocols such as telnet. Much work has been done to characterize traffic patterns on both wide and local area networks, often for the purpose of examining and predicting congestion through the use of statistical models, for example in [Drak93], [FaSo92], and [FoLe91]. A somewhat smaller body of literature has examined the characteristics of network traffic according to protocol, as in [CDJM91], [DJCM92], [Paxs93a], and [Paxs93b]. These studies have focussed on protocols which currently constitute a large percentage of network traffic. In these studies, traffic from emerging information retrieval applications such as Gopher and WAIS tends to be classified as "other". However, we hypothesize that the amount of traffic from these applications will grow steadily in the future as they become increasingly popular. Additionally, the characteristics of these protocols may change as they incorporate large numbers of multimedia objects. Therefore, it is useful to establish the current traffic usage of these protocols so that their growth and evolution may be measured over time.
