Title: PM Case Studies: A Tentative Characterisation  
Author: Ian Robertson 
Address: Manchester M13 9PL  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of  
Abstract: Case studies are an essential feature of process modelling research. This work introduces a possible structure to assist in assembling and reporting the fragmented findings of such experiences

Reference-contexts: Research activity can thus focussed on these few processes with beneficial results. Work has already been done on what may well be a closely associated area: that of the characterisation of technologies [4] <ref> [1] </ref>. It seems very unlikely that all processes can be effectively supported by all technologies and some kind of mapping of process properties to technology properties would be of immeasurable benefit to practitioners. The SERC funded project `Process Engineering Framework' is currently exploring these, and other areas.

Reference-contexts: It is thus difficult to assemble the results of the case studies into a meaningful `whole' of experience. These findings thus need to be classified in some way, and this characteri-sation is only a first step in achieving this aim. Earlier work by Lonchamps [3] and Humphrey and Feiler <ref> [2] </ref>, focussing on the software process domain and the subject process itself, provide a useful starting point to from which to develop such a structure.

In some cases it was felt that the definitions were rather too pre-disposed towards automated process execution, and it is hoped to re-examine these definitions in the near future. In the meantime the existing definitions can be used.

Reference-contexts: This work will be further developed at Manchester by using this framework as a comparative framework incorporating those earlier case studies which have, to a large extent, gone unreported, and also to support and augment more general operational research studies <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One ongoing thread of this work is our involvement with operational research activities in commercial, industrial, and government organisations. These studies have been undertaken for a number of reasons, primarily as a way of testing our current version of our Process Analysis and Design Methodology (PADM) <ref> [6] </ref>, but also to seek new insights into the pattern of activity which we refer to as `process'.
