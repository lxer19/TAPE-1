Abstract: Copyright c fl 1996 L. Peter Deutsch Permission is granted to copy and distribute this document for any purpose and without charge, including translations into other languages and incorporation into compilations, provided that the copyright notice and this notice are preserved, and that any substantive changes or deletions from the original are clearly marked. A pointer to the latest version of this and related documentation in HTML format can be found at the URL &lt;ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html&gt;. Abstract This specification defines a lossless compressed data format that is compatible with the widely used GZIP utility. The format includes a cyclic redundancy check value for detecting data corruption. The format presently uses the DEFLATE method of compression but can be easily extended to use other compression methods. The format can be implemented readily in a manner not covered by patents.
