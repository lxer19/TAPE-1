Title: The Union of Moving Polygonal Pseudodiscs Combinatorial Bounds and Applications Both bounds are almost tight
Author: Mark de Berg Hazel Everett Leonidas J. Guibas 
Note: 3-space is O(n 2 4 (n)).  
Abstract: Let P be a set of polygonal pseudodiscs in the plane with n edges in total translating with fixed velocities in fixed directions. We prove that the maximum number of combinatorial changes in the union of P is fi(n 2 ff(n)). In general, if the pseudodiscs move along curved trajectories, then the maximum number of changes in the union is fi(n s+2 (n)), where s is the maximum number of times any triple of polygon edges meet in a common point. We apply this result in two different settings. First, we prove that the complexity of the free space of a constant-complexity polygon translating amidst convex polyhedral obstacles with n edges in total is O(n 2 ff(n)). Second, we show that the complexity of the space of lines missing a set of n convex homothetic polytopes of constant complexity in

Reference-contexts: In Section 2 we prove that in this case the maximum number of changes in the union is only fi (n 3 (n)), where q (n) is the maximum length of an (n; q)-Davenport-Schinzel sequence. The function q (n) is roughly linear in n for any constant q <ref> [1] </ref>; for instance, 3 (n) = fi (nff (n)), where ff (n) denotes the extremely slowly growing functional inverse of the Ackermann function. <p> The trajectories of the pseudodiscs have the property that any triple of edges meets at most s times in a common point. Hence, two curved segments in the edge-time diagram intersect at most s times, so the upper envelope has complexity O ( s+2 (n)) <ref> [1] </ref>. Similarly, the vertices of the union of the histograms whose bases are on the higher of the two lines are on a lower envelope, so there are only O ( s+2 (n)) of them.

Reference-contexts: It is not necessary here that the robot is a triangle; it can be any constant complexity convex polygon. Our technique does not work, however, for polyhedral robots. For this more general case, Aronov and Sharir <ref> [2] </ref> proved an O (n 2 log 2 n) bound. 1 (Although our motion planning application is a special case of the problem considered by Aronov and Sharir, their results do not carry over to our setting of moving and deforming pseudodiscs in the plane.) The second example of the applicability

Reference-contexts: at most s times and whose upper envelope has fi ( s+2 (n)) complexity. (Such a set can be constructed as follows: Take a set of n continuous functions, each pair of which intersects at most s + 2 times, and whose upper envelope has fi ( s+2 (n)) complexity <ref> [3] </ref>. For each pair of functions, consider the first intersection point. Before this intersection point, one of the two functions cannot contribute to the upper envelope; delete this part, thereby reducing the number of intersections of the pair by one.

Reference-contexts: In many problems this interaction plays a fundamental role|the ray shooting problem is an example. It is therefore essential to understand the combinatorial and algorithmic issues involved in the interaction <ref> [4] </ref>. A natural way to classify lines with respect to a given set of polyhedra is to distinguish between lines that intersect one or more of the polyhedra, and lines that miss all polyhedra.

Reference-contexts: The first example is another motion planning problem: we want to bound the complexity of the free space of a convex polygon translating amidst convex polyhedral obstacles in 3-space with n edges in total. Halperin and Yap <ref> [5] </ref> study this problem for the case where the robot is a triangle. By adapting the proof technique of Leven and Sharir they show an O (n 2 ff (n)) bound on a certain type of features of the free space; they do not bound the total number of features.

Reference-contexts: If the robot is allowed to translate only, then the free space can be described as the complement of the union of a set of pseudodiscs|namely the Minkowski sums of the obstacles with the image of R under central reflection|which has O (n) complexity <ref> [6] </ref>. When the robot is allowed to rotate also, we need three parameters to describe a placement: x- and y-coordinate of a reference point, and its orientation . Hence, the configuration space is three-dimensional. <p> The Minkowski sums of a set of disjoint obstacles with a fixed robot in the plane is an example of a set of pseudodiscs <ref> [6] </ref>.) The union of the polygons P i (t) changes continuously as t increases. At certain times, however, the combinatorial structure of the union changes. The goal of this section is to prove the following theorem on the number of combinatorial changes. <p> If the polygons are pseudodiscs, however, it is not possible to construct a grid-like union. In fact, the union of a collection of pseudodiscs has linear complexity <ref> [6] </ref>. In the remainder of this section we prove that the number of external EEE-events for a set of moving pseudodiscs is roughly quadratic, which implies a similar bound on the number of changes in their union. Consider a fixed edge e of a polygon P i .

Reference-contexts: Thus our result applies, provided we can bound the number of times three edges of the pseudodiscs meet during the sweep. This way we can obtain the same bound on the complexity of the free space of a translating and rotating robot in the plane as Leven and Sharir <ref> [7] </ref>. In fact, our proof technique for bounding the changes in the union of moving pseudodiscs is very similar to their technique for bounding the free space complexity in the above-mentioned problem. The main difference is that our description is more general, which makes it directly applicable in many problems. <p> We say that e witnesses this event if both b I j (t fl ) and b I k (t fl ) contain an endpoint of e. (This notion corresponds to the notion of one obstacle `bounding' another obstacle in the paper by Leven and Sharir <ref> [7] </ref>.) Lemma 2.4 An edge e witnesses O ( s+2 (n)) EEE-events. Proof: Consider the edge-time diagram of e, which is defined as follows. The vertical axis in the diagram represents the line `(e), and the horizontal axis represents time.

Reference-contexts: For k Minkowski sums with a total of n edges, their bound is O (nk log 2 k). 2 space of missing lines is fi (n 4 ), but in special cases better bounds are sometimes possible. For instance, Pellegrini <ref> [8] </ref> proved that the space of lines missing a starshaped polyhedron (such as a polyhedral terrain) with n edges is O (n 3 fi (n)), where fi (n) is a slowly growing function. (To be precise: fi (n) = 2 c p log n for some constant c.) Using our result
