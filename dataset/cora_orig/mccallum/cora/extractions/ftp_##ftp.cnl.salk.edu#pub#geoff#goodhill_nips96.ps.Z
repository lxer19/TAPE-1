Abstract: Topographic mappings occur frequently in the brain. A popular approach to understanding the structure of such mappings is to map points representing input features in a space of a few dimensions to points in a 2 dimensional space using some self-organizing algorithm. We argue that a more general approach may be useful, where similarities between features are not constrained to be geometric distances, and the objective function for topographic matching is chosen explicitly rather than being specified implicitly by the self-organizing algorithm. We investigate analytically an example of this more general approach applied to the structure of interdigitated mappings, such as the pattern of ocular dominance columns in primary visual cortex.

However not all homeomorphisms have this property, so we refer to such perfect maps as topographic homeomorphisms.

Reference-contexts: How F and G are defined is problem-specific. C has a number of important properties that help to justify its adoption as a measure of the degree of topography of a mapping (for more details see <ref> [3] </ref>). For instance, it can be shown that if a mapping that preserves ordering relationships between two similarity matrices exists, then maximizing C will find it. Such maps are homeomorphisms. However not all homeomorphisms have this property, so we refer to such perfect maps as topographic homeomorphisms. <p> The consequences of one particular alternative set of choices has been examined for the case of an interdigitated map of two variables. Many alternative objective functions for topographic matching are of course possible; this topic is reviewed in <ref> [3] </ref>. Two issues we have not discussed are the most appropriate way to define the features of interest, and the most appropriate measures of similarity between features (see [10] for an interesting discussion).

Reference-contexts: By varying the value of k it is thus possible to smoothly vary the periodicity of the locally optimal striped map. Such behavior predicted the outcome of a recent biological experiment <ref> [4] </ref>. For k &lt; 1 the globally optimal map is stripes of width n = 2. However, in principle many alternative ways of measuring the similarity in V in are possible. <p> We assume for ease of analysis that G is still as given in equation 4. This directly implements an intuitive notion put forward to account for the inter-digitation of the ocular dominance mapping <ref> [4] </ref>: that the cortex tries to represent similar inputs close together, that similarity is given by the degree of correlation between the activities of points (cells), and additionally that natural visual scenes impose a correlational structure of the same qualitative form as equation 5.

Reference-contexts: onto one target structure, such as the ocular dominance mapping from the right and left eyes to V1 in the cat and monkey. 2 SIMILARITY MEASURES A much-investigated computational approach to the study of mappings in V1 is to consider the input features as points in a multidimensional euclidean space <ref> [1, 5, 9] </ref>. The input dimensions then consist of e.g. spatial position, orientation, ocular dominance, and so on.

For simplicity we consider only the case of two one-dimensional retinae mapping to a one-dimensional cortex. <p> For simplicity we consider only the case of two one-dimensional retinae mapping to a one-dimensional cortex. The feature space approach to the problem presented in <ref> [5] </ref> says that the dissimilarities in V in are given by squared euclidean distances between points arranged in two parallel rows in a two-dimensional space. <p> G (i; j) is given by G (i; j) = 1 : i; j neighbouring 0 : otherwise (4) It can be shown that the globally optimal mapping (i.e. minimum of C) when k &gt; 1 is to keep the two halves of V in entirely separate in V out <ref> [5] </ref>. However, there is also a local minimum for an interdigitated (or striped) map, where the interdigitations have width n = 2k. By varying the value of k it is thus possible to smoothly vary the periodicity of the locally optimal striped map. <p> We now calculate C analytically for various mappings (c.f. <ref> [5] </ref>), and compare the cost of a map that keeps the two halves of V in entirely separate in V out to those which interdigitate the two halves of V in with some regular periodicity. <p> To characterize this system we now analyze how the n for which C s (n) has a local maximum varies with c; ff; fi, and when this local maximum is also a global maximum. Setting dC s (n) dn = 0 does not yield analytically tractable expressions (unlike <ref> [5] </ref>). However, more direct methods can be used: there is a local maximum at n if C s (n 1) &lt; C s (n) &gt; C s (n + 1). Using equation 7 we derive conditions on c for this to be true.
