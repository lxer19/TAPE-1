Title: D-Bases for Polynomial Ideals over Commutative Noetherian Rings

Abstract: We present a completion-like procedure for constructing D-bases for polynomial ideals over commutative Noetherian rings with unit. The procedure is described at an abstract level, by transition rules. Its termination is proved under certain assumptions about the strategy that controls the application of the transition rules. Correctness is established by proof simplification techniques.

Reference-contexts: We describe our method in proof-theoretic terms, as an abstract completion procedure in the sense of Bachmair and Dershowitz <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. The presentation is by transition (or inference) rules operating on sets of equations and rewrite rules. Transitions describe basic steps for changing the presentation of the underlying equational theory. If a suitable control strategy is applied, this transformation process yields a D-basis. <p> The addition of constraints gave rise to a number of technical problems, which required us to redesign some transition rules and to add new ones, while also changing the term signature slightly. We assume that the reader is familiar with the theory of term rewriting and completion <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. <p> Finally, the condition about zero divisors enables us to "split off" certain parts of equations so as to obtain a suitable notion of rewriting. 4 Polynomial Completion We use a completion approach for constructing D-bases. We follow the methodology of Bachmair and Dershowitz <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. and describe completion by transition rules operating on sets of (polynomial) equations and rules. Each set of equations E defines a set of (ground) proofs. Transition rules are designed to enable proof transformations that eventually yield certain normal-form proofs. <p> If N 1 is the limit of a fair derivation, then N e 1 is a D-basis. This theorem can be proved using proof simplification techniques for associative-commutative completion (and similar proof orderings), as described by Bachmair and Dershowitz <ref> [2, 1] </ref>. There is one important difference, though. We do not deduce extended equations and consequently are not able to eliminate corresponding peaks of the form q P nAC p ! R r.

Reference-contexts: The standard way of getting rid of these proof patterns is by critical pair computation (in the case of peaks) and by extended rules (in the case of cliffs), cf. Bachmair and Dershowitz <ref> [2] </ref>. Roughly speaking, critical pairs are equations p q obtained from "minimal" peaks called "overlaps." The (ground) convergent rewrite system P e , for instance, contains the ex tensions of rules in P . <p> If N 1 is the limit of a fair derivation, then N e 1 is a D-basis. This theorem can be proved using proof simplification techniques for associative-commutative completion (and similar proof orderings), as described by Bachmair and Dershowitz <ref> [2, 1] </ref>. There is one important difference, though. We do not deduce extended equations and consequently are not able to eliminate corresponding peaks of the form q P nAC p ! R r.

Reference-contexts: The current paper is a continuation of previous work in this direction in which Buchberger's original algorithm for constructing a Grobner basis for a polynomial ideal over a field was described in a proof-theoretic setting similar to the one we use, cf. <ref> [3] </ref>. But in the case of polynomials over fields, a considerably optimized and simplified procedure is possible that, for instance, does not require the flexibility of the full constraint formalism. <p> We first outline how polynomials may be represented as (variable-free) first-order terms over a many-sorted signature with sorts Coef (coefficients), PProd (power products) and P oly (polynomial expressions), see also Bundgen [10] and Bachmair and Ganzinger <ref> [3] </ref>. Coefficients We assume that the coefficient domain is a commutative ring with unit, specified by some algebra B over a given signature so that every element of B is represented by some ground term (i.e., B is term-generated).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Buchberger's algorithm for constructing a Grobner basis for polynomial ideals over a field is one of the central methods in computational algebra [7, 9]. It has been extended in two directions: to polynomials over coefficient domains other than fields and to non-commutative polynomial rings, cf. <ref> [6] </ref>. For instance, Kandri-Rody and Kapur [11] and Pan [14] considered polynomials over Euclidian rings and principal ideal domains, respectively. <p> Since the divisibility relation on power products is a Dickson partial order, there exists an infinite subsequence t n 1 ; t n 2 ; : : : such that t n i properly divides t n j for all i &lt; j (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>, pp. 162 & 189). Since N 1 is left-reduced, we have I n i+1 6 I n i , for all i. Suppose we have I n j 6 I n j+1 , for some j. <p> A similar result was proved by Richman [16]. 13 5 Summary Algorithms for constructing polynomial ideal bases have been extensively studied, cf. Becker and Weispfenning <ref> [6] </ref>. Our work generalizes previous results for commutative polynomials in that we consider a larger class of coefficient domains (including domains with zero divisors). The basic conditions we impose on a coefficient domain are (i) decidability of ideal membership (for finitely generated ideals) and (ii) computability of syzygy generators.

In this paper, we present <p> We believe that most of the rewrite-based methods for constructing ideal bases for commutative polynomial rings can be described within our formalism. In particular, this is the case for Buchberger's original algorithm and for the method proposed by Pan <ref> [14] </ref> for polynomials over principal ideal domains. Buchberger's original algorithm works for coefficient domains that are fields, in which case we also obtain Grobner bases (and not just D-bases), because extended equations and union critical pairs become irrelevant.

Reference-contexts: We will consider rewriting with AC-matching, where AC is the above set of associativity and commutativity axioms. In this case, part of condition (ii) above can be satisfied by the inclusion of so-called extended rules (cf. Peterson and Stickel <ref> [15] </ref>).
