Abstract: We initiate a computational theory of statistical tests. Loosely speaking, we say that an algorithm is a statistical test if it rejects a "negligible" fraction of strings. We say that a statistical test is universal for a class of algorithms if it rejects all (but finitely many) of the strings rejected by each algorithm in the class. We consider the existence and efficiency of universal statistical tests for various classes of statistical tests. We also consider the relation between ensembles passing statistical tests of particular complexity and ensembles which are indistinguishable from uniform by algorithms of the same complexity. Some of our results refer to relatively simple statistical tests (e.g., those implemented by counter machines). In addition to their own merit, we hope that these results will stimulate investigations directed towards results that refer to more complex statistical tests (e.g., those implemented in log-space).

Reference-contexts: Hence, much remains to be understood. Finally, we use a construction of Levin [13] to prove that the existence of one-way function is a necessary condition for the existence of "non-trivial" ensembles (see section 7) which pass all probabilistic polynomial-time statistical tests.

Our main result relates pseudorandom generators and "generators" which generate ensembles which are accepted by all probabilistic polynomial-time statistical tests. We first recall the definition of a pseudorandom generator. Definition 9 (pseudorandom generator <ref> [1, 19] </ref>): A (deterministic) polynomial-time algorithm G is called a pseudorandom generator (prg) if the following two conditions hold: 1. jG (ff)j jffj + 1, for all ff 2 f0; 1g fl . 2.

Reference-contexts: Hence, item (3) follows. To prove the "furthermore clause" referring to items (1) and (2), we need a Large Deviation Theorem for Markov Chains (cf. <ref> [3] </ref> Section 2.4). This theorem guarantees that only with exponentially small probability the sum of counter modifications in a random walk may deviate linearly from its expectation 6 .

Reference-contexts: The Lempel-Ziv algorithm [11] may seem as a plausible candidate. Unfortunately, this algorithm is not universal for the class of log-space machines (since it accepts any de-Bruijn sequence [11, Thm. 5], whereas there exists de-Bruijn sequences that can be constructed and thus recognized and rejected by a log-space machine <ref> [4] </ref>). Yet, this example should at least give an idea of what is wanted. We believe that the ability to present reasonable universal tests for a class of statistical tests is linked to a good understanding of the structure of the algorithms in the class.

By a sequence of results, culminating in <ref> [7] </ref>, pseudorandom generators exist if and only if one-way functions exist. Interestingly, this condition is also equivalent to the existence of statistically-accepted generators defined below.

Reference-contexts: The behaviour of P s (m) converges to a random variable Q (m mod k), where k, 1 k q is an integer (see <ref> [8] </ref> proof of Thm. 4.1.4 which refers to the convergence of a regular Markov Chain to the stationary distribution). <p> Hence, for n i (mod k), a random walk of length n ends in v with constant probability. It follows by Definition 2 that v must be accepting. Using an even simpler argument (cf. <ref> [8] </ref> proof of Thm. 3.1.1) it follows that the probability that a n-long random walk does not end in a sink is bounded above by 2 n=q . <p> It is also clear that configurations which are not reachable can be made rejecting without affecting the acceptance profile of the machine. It is left to deal with sinks in which not all cycles have zero sum. Using the Central Limit Theorem for Markov Chains (cf. <ref> [8] </ref> Thm. 4.6.9) it follows that the sum of counter modifications in a random walk is unlikely to deviate linearly from the expectation (i.e., the CLT guarantees that such deviation occurs with probability tending to zero). Hence, items (1) and (2) above follow. <p> Similarly, we can discard all sinks with zero average, and concentrate on sinks with non-zero average. Let be the minimum deviation from zero of the average of any non-zero sink of T (i.e. of either positive or negative average). The Central Limit Theorem for Markov Chains (cf. <ref> [8] </ref> Thm. 4.6.9) guarantees that for any p and for sufficiently large K (depending only on the sink of T ) the probability that a random walk of length K starting from any location in the sink yields total counter modification of less than K 2 (towards the expected direction) is

Reference-contexts: In the second edition, 11 tests are listed. There is no apparent rhyme or reason to the test selection, and future editions may well have even more tests. A comment, at the end of Section 3.3.2 in <ref> [10] </ref>, asserts that at least some of the given statistical tests are "independent of the others" in the sense that there exists a sequence that passes all but the one test. Knuth offers no clues to a theory which may govern one's decision of which test one should use.

Reference-contexts: The universal test just mentioned (i.e., for the class of logspace tests) is neither "natural" nor "practical". We believe that presenting such a universal test is an important research goal. The Lempel-Ziv algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> may seem as a plausible candidate. Unfortunately, this algorithm is not universal for the class of log-space machines (since it accepts any de-Bruijn sequence [11, Thm. 5], whereas there exists de-Bruijn sequences that can be constructed and thus recognized and rejected by a log-space machine [4]). <p> We believe that presenting such a universal test is an important research goal.

Yet, this example should at least give an idea of what is wanted. <p> For alternative (N1) we know only of a universal test which amounts to running all admissible tests. We remark that the Lempel-Ziv algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> can be shown to be universal for the class of finite state tests (under alternatives (N1) and (N2)), and for the class of weak counter machines (under alternative (N2)). (The first statement is obvious whereas the second statement follows from the characterization of statistical tests which are weak counter machines.) <p> Remark 5 : Under an appropriate choice of parameters, it can be shown that a test based on the Lempel-Ziv algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> dominates the frequency test (i.e., rejects all the strings that are rejected by the frequency test). Hence, the LZ algorithm can be viewed as a universal statistical test for the class of weak 1-counter machines.

Reference-contexts: A positive result is presented for the class of constant-space on-line (i.e., finite state) machines, whereas a negative result is presented for the class of log-space on-line machines. Hence, much remains to be understood. Finally, we use a construction of Levin <ref> [13] </ref> to prove that the existence of one-way function is a necessary condition for the existence of "non-trivial" ensembles (see section 7) which pass all probabilistic polynomial-time statistical tests. <p> The theorem follows by proving that the existence of a statistically-accepted generator implies the existence of a one-way function (and hence the existence of pseudorandom generators). To this end, we note that the construction used by Levin <ref> [13] </ref>, to prove that the existence of pseudorandom generators implies the existence of one-way functions, proves in fact the stronger statement we just made. For sake of self-containment, this construction is repeated below. Let G be an arbitrary statistically-accepted generator.

Reference-contexts: Using the results of Nisan <ref> [15, 16] </ref>, it is possible to implement the above universal test in slightly more than polynomial-time and in polylogarithmic space.
