Title: Efficient Management of Very Large Ontologies  
Author: Kilian Stoffel, Merwyn Taylor and Jim Hendler 
Address: College Park, MD, 20742  
Affiliation: University of Maryland Computer Science Department  
Abstract: This paper describes an environment for supporting very large ontologies. The system can be used on single PCs, workstations, a cluster of workstations, and high-end parallel supercomputers. The architecture of the system uses the secondary storage of a relational data base system, efficient memory management, and (optionally) parallelism. This allows us to answer complex queries in very large ontologies in a few seconds on a single processor machine and in fractions of a second on parallel super computers. The main contribution of our approach is the open architecture of the system on both the hardware and the software levels allowing us easily to translate existing ontologies for our system's use, and to port the system to a wide range of platforms.

Reference-contexts: To solve this problem, we are are exploring the integration of our system with other, more advanced, databases particularly parallel DB systems. (For example, the binary structure of the relations we use to record attributes is similar to those used by the parallel RDBMS MONET <ref> (Holsheimer, Kersten, & Siebes 1996) </ref>, and thus map nicely onto that system.) Similarly, other aspects of our system resemble features of object-oriented databases and we are exploring OSQL and other such languages for integration with these.

Reference-contexts: We use the term hybrid ontologies for the latter, those combining both ontological relations and the instances defined thereon. This second group may consist of a relatively small ontological part and a much larger example base, or as a dense combination of relations and instances <ref> (Stoffel et al. 1997) </ref>. Currently, there is a significant amount of research being done in the area of ontology development and management. <p> We use this ontology in a project at the Johns Hopkins Hospital to create a high level interface for browsing several lab databases as well as to do some data mining tasks on these databases <ref> (Stoffel et al. 1997) </ref>. Word Net WordNet is an on-line lexical reference system whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory ((Miller 1996),page 1). <p> It allows the user to insert, delete and update information in the ontology and also to pose queries. These operations can be done through a graphical user interface. However, to allow large ontologies to be embedded in other computer systems (such as our datamining program <ref> (Stoffel et al. 1997) </ref>), the system also can be invoked via an API which allows front-end processes to access the system. The API offers a su-perset of the functionality of the graphical interface in the form of Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).
