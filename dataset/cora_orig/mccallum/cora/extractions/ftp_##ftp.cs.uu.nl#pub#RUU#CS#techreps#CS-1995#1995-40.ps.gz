Title: A Dynamic Logic of Iterated Belief Change

Abstract: In this paper we propose a general framework to study iterated changes of belief. Expansions, contractions and revisions are taken as actions which may be performed by an agent, resulting in a change of its beliefs. The syntax of the framework is given by a multi-modal language, containing modalities to reason about the agent's knowledge | representing its non-defeasible, veridical information | and belief | representing its defeasi-ble, non-veridical, working information | as well as a modality to reason about the results of belief-changing actions. The semantics is defined using Kripke-style possible worlds models. The formalisation of single-step belief changes is proved to be sound and complete with regard to the respective AGM axiomatisations. Iterated changes of belief correspond to sequences of belief-changing actions. When dealing with sequences of actions, we allow the result of a belief-changing action to depend on other factors besides the set of beliefs and the formula that this set is changed with, thereby adopting a dynamic view on iterated belief change. Several desirable properties of iterated belief change are proved to be valid in our formalisation. Furthermore the validity of various recently proposed postulates for iterated belief revision is checked.

In dynamic approaches to iterated belief change, as for instance proposed by Boutilier <ref> [2] </ref> in the setting of a conditional logic, and by Williams [16] in a probabilistic setting, the agent starts with a belief set K and a method of changing K.

In this case fl is exactly the AGM revision that results from applying the Levi-identity to the AGM contraction <ref> [5] </ref>. From Theorem 2.20 it follows that some selection function for M K exists, such that for all ' 2 L 0 , K ' = B (r (contract '; M K )) for r based on . Now let be such a selection function.

Reference-contexts: The semantics that we present for the non-iterated fragment, resembles the spheres semantics proposed by Grove <ref> [6] </ref> to model belief revision. However, whereas Grove uses the representation of the original AGM framework, the system that we define allows for a concise formulation of the AGM postulates in a modal language. <p> Remark. The definition of selection functions as presented above may be seen as the implementation of a suggestion by Grove <ref> [6] </ref>. Grove uses a system of spheres surrounding a belief set to define belief revision. Grove indicates that with every system of spheres some function can be associated that `selects the `closest' worlds' ([6], p. 159) in which some formula holds. <p> Let furthermore M K = hS; Bi be the K-model. First we need some additional definitions. 2.18. Definition. For a given belief set K, K ? ' is the set of all maximal subsets of K not entailing ', and ? (K) is S Following an observation by Grove <ref> [6] </ref>, we state without proof that for a given belief set K a bijection f exists between the elements of S n B in M K and ? (K), such that K 0 2 K ? ' = f 2 L 0 j 8s 2 B [ f (K 0 )[s

Reference-contexts: Belief-changing actions are interpreted as model-transformers rather than the more common state-transitions, which is the usual interpretation for actions in dynamic logic <ref> [7] </ref>. The reason for this lies in the fact that belief-changing actions do not change the state of the world in which the agent resides, but the doxastic state of the agent, which is formalised through the set of doxastic alternatives in the model.

Reference-contexts: This working information may grow, sometimes not justifiedly, in which case it should be possible to retract certain beliefs. Thus beliefs are defeasible and non-veridical. In representing the agent's knowledge and belief we follow the approach common in epistemic and doxastic logic <ref> [8] </ref>: the formula K' denotes the fact that the agent knows ', and B' that it believes '. As the result of the execution of belief-changing actions, the agent expands, contracts and revises its beliefs.

Reference-contexts: Since our formali-sation of belief-changing actions presupposes the existence of inconsistent belief sets, our notion of belief does not satisfy the D-axiom :(B' ^ B:') (this in contrast with the more common approach to belief of Kraus & Lehmann <ref> [9] </ref>). The definition of r for the expand action is based on the idea that uncertainties of an agent are formalised through its set of doxastic alternatives, and expansions put an end to uncertainties.

Reference-contexts: The definition of the revise action is a straightforward implementation of the Levi identity <ref> [11] </ref>, which states that revisions can be defined in terms of contractions and expansions, viz. a revision with some formula ' can be brought about as a contraction with :' followed by an expansion with ' (see x2.1). The semantics for L is defined using Kripke-style possible worlds models.

Reference-contexts: In our opinion this postulate is a reasonable and acceptable one, especially from an agent-oriented point of view. Consider for instance the situation of an agent that adopts some formula by default (cf. <ref> [13] </ref>). Upon recognising a possible inconsistency caused by this adoption, the agent could decide to retract the formula again, thereby expecting to end up with its original belief set. Despite its apparent acceptability this postulate is explicitly not present in the AGM framework.

Reference-contexts: The resulting system may be seen as providing a dynamic logic of iterated belief change, in which an agent continually changes its beliefs by performing belief-changing actions. The fragment of our framework that deals with non-iterated, single-step belief changes, is in spirit similar to the approach proposed by Segerberg <ref> [15] </ref>, though in effect different, the most notable difference being the fact that all AGM postulates are validated in our framework (see x2.1) whereas this is not the case in Segerberg's.

Various modifications of, and alternatives to, this framework have been proposed <ref> [2, 3, 4, 10, 14, 16] </ref>, all aimed at providing an intuitively acceptable account of iterated belief revision. The approach that we propose in this paper is a more general one than the approaches mentioned above. <p> Intuitively, a belief system consists of a set of beliefs of the agent and a method describing how the belief set changes under the execution of belief-changing actions. As such, these belief systems are highly analogous to the knowledge systems of Williams <ref> [16] </ref>, which consist of a knowledge set and a preference relation which determines how changes of the knowledge set work out. <p> As such, our approach is a typical dynamic one, according to the classification proposed by Freund & Lehmann [4]. In dynamic approaches to iterated belief change, as for instance proposed by Boutilier [2] in the setting of a conditional logic, and by Williams <ref> [16] </ref> in a probabilistic setting, the agent starts with a belief set K and a method of changing K. A change of belief does not only modify K but also affects the method of changing the belief set such that the new method is applicable to the new belief set. <p> In the case that the negation of a formula becomes disbelieved as the result of performing a contraction, 16 the new selection function yields an empty set of worlds when applied to this formula. Following the terminology of Williams <ref> [16] </ref>, we refer to the process of changing a belief system as a transmutation. The transmutations caused by the execution of a belief-changing action preserve well-definedness of belief systems. 3.6. Proposition.
