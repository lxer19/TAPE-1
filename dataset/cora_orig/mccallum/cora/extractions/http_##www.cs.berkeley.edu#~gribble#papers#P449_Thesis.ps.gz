Reference-contexts: Typically, we restrict our study to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. When x n approaches 1, 1 x n becomes small and drives the population back down towards 0. <p> At p = 4 (and most of the other values for which p &gt; 3:57 : : :) the system exhibits chaoticity. For the purposes of this section, we will look at the p = 4 case. Consider the homeomorphism of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> into itself given by (Ruelle [14], p. 41): (x) = arcsinx 1 Then, we define ~ f (x) = ffi f ffi 1 (x) = 2x if x 2 0; 1 fl fi 1 fl (46) The map (46) is a tent map, which preserves the Lebesgue measure 2 <p> This further implies g (y) = a 0 , which satisfies definition (5) and demonstrates that (44) is ergodic. 4.1.3 Topological Entropy Consider an initial partition A of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> consisting of the single set a 1 = [0; 1]. We then have f 1 (A) = B = fb 1 ; b 2 g where b 1 = [0; :5] and b 2 = [0:5; 1] . <p> This further implies g (y) = a 0 , which satisfies definition (5) and demonstrates that (44) is ergodic. 4.1.3 Topological Entropy Consider an initial partition A of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> consisting of the single set a 1 = [0; 1]. We then have f 1 (A) = B = fb 1 ; b 2 g where b 1 = [0; :5] and b 2 = [0:5; 1] . <p> We then have f 1 (A) = B = fb 1 ; b 2 g where b 1 = [0; :5] and b 2 = <ref> [0:5; 1] </ref> . Continuing, we see f 2 (A) = f 1 (B) = C = fc 1 ; c 2 ; c 3 ; c 4 g as illustrated in figure 4. <p> From classical mechanics, Jacobi's theorem tells us that solving for the dynamics of a Hamiltonian system is equivalent to finding the geodesics of an appropriate manifold. Stated without proof, Jacobi's theorem (refer to Abraham and Marsden <ref> [1] </ref>) is: Theorem 5 (Jacobi's Theorem) The integral curves of a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian with a fixed energy E are the same as the geodesics of the manifold with metric g E = (E V )g, where E &gt; V and the energy is equal to 1, up to reparametrization. <p> Refer to figure 12 for an illustration of these issues. 5.1.1 Algorithm We are now in a position to specify the algorithm for estimating topological entropy. The overall approach of the algorithm is to pick an initial partition of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> into a set of disjoint intervals, and to iterate this initial partition through the inverse logistic equation.

Reference-contexts: This is denoted by B &gt; A. We can now define a refining sequence of partitions: fA n jn = 1; 2; : : :g where A n &lt; A n+1 and for all B; 9A n &gt; B: (33) Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew <ref> [2] </ref> have shown that if fC n g is a refining sequence, then: h (f ) = lim h (f; C n ): (34) This equation for h (f ) has far more practical value than (32). <p> Topological entropy can be similarly defined for a flow f : A; t ! A. In this case, Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew <ref> [2] </ref> have supposed that h (f t ) = jtj h (f 1 ): (35) In this way, the discrete mappings that we have been considering can be thought of as a flow over a unit time period. 3.2 Features of Topological Entropy In many senses, topological entropy provides a true <p> Fortunately, an idea similar to (34) can be applied, in that given a refining sequence fC n g, we can again state: h (f) = lim h (f; C n ): (41) It has been conjectured <ref> [2] </ref> that h (f ) = sup h (f ); (42) where the supremum is taken over all normalized Borel measures invariant through the map f. (Refer to appendix B for a discussion of Borel measures and measure spaces in general.) It is certainly the case, however, that h (f) h

Reference-contexts: The resulting surface of genus two has been shown to be ergodic. For a proof of this, refer to Arnold and Avez <ref> [3] </ref>. We have already seen from equation (73) that it is not possible to construct a 2-dimensional surface of genus 1 (ie. the 2-torus T 2 ) with negative curvature.

Reference-contexts: This is one of the earliest recorded observations of ergodic behaviour. Recently, chaotic systems have been under intense scrutiny, but surprisingly there is still a lack of consensus on a rigorous definition of chaos.

Reference-contexts: This description of a geodesic lends itself well to the Euler-Lagrange minimization of action integrals. (A discussion of the this theorem can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>.) We can equivalently choose to extremize distance squared, in which case our action integral becomes: I = 1 g fffi _x ff _x fi dt (72) where 1 and 2 are the endpoints of the variational path on the manifold, and g fffi is the metric of the manifold.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Knowledge of the existence of ergodic and chaotic behaviour is not a new phenomenon. Nicole Oresme, in his treatise Tractatus de commensurabilitate vel incommensurabilitate motuum cell <ref> [7] </ref> (dated 1351), examined the motion of two bodies on a circle having constant but incommensurable velocities, and concluded that: No sector of a circle is so small that two such mobiles could not conjunct in it at some future time, and could not have conjuncted in it sometime [in the

Reference-contexts: This introduces rather extreme resource utilization issues into this primitive algorithm.) Quadrilaterals can be discretized into a finite set of grid elements by clipping the quadrilateral to elements from discretization grid. (The Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm was chosen for our prototype implementation. 32 Refer to Hill <ref> [8] </ref>, pages 714-718 for a specification of this algorithm.) If the quadrilateral intersects a given grid element, then the result of such a clipping will be a finite set of edges; we can simply test to see if any edges result from clipping the quadrilateral to an arbitrary grid element, and

Reference-contexts: However, the overall concepts behind the i remain the same. It is therefore sufficient to present the theory behind the calculation of the Lyapunov exponent of a 1-d difference equation in full detail, and only summarize the final results for other classes of systems. 2.2.1 1-d Difference Equations Jackson <ref> [9] </ref> gives an excellent presentation of the physicists' definition Lyapunov exponents and 1-d difference equations, which is summarized here.

Reference-contexts: In this case, we know that jz (t)j ! A exp ( 1 t), or 1 (x) = lim 1 ln jz (t)j: (16) A straightforward numerical implementation of (16) will result in an accurate approximation of 1 . Refer to Jackson <ref> [10] </ref> for a discussion on how to approximate the remaining i . 2.3 Features of Lyapunov Exponents There are two important features of Lyapunov exponents that limit their usefulness as a practical tool for characterizing chaotic systems. Firstly, Lyapunov exponents are local in nature. <p> If an experimenter can only measure the state of a system to a finite degree of accuracy, then topological entropy measures the rate at which the experimentor can gain more information about the system as it evolves over time. 10 3.1 The Calculation of Topological Entropy (Jackson <ref> [10] </ref>) Consider a compact space X and a continuous map f that takes the space into itself, f : X !

Reference-contexts: A related definition of ergodicity (cited in <ref> [12] </ref>) can be given as: Definition 5 (Ergodicity) Given the mapping f : M ! M which preserves the probability measure , then f is ergodic if and only if every invariant, measurable function g = g ffi f on M is constant almost everywhere. <p> It should be stressed that these definitions of ergodicity are all completely equivalent. In fact, Peterson <ref> [12] </ref> explicitly proves the equivalence of these defintions; we may therefore use any of them in order to demonstrate the ergodicity of a given dynamical system. 2.1.2 Features of Ergodicity In contrast to Lyapunov exponents, ergodicity is a global, time independent quality of a system. <p> Given ! 1 ; ! 2 2 R, then ! 1 and ! 2 are commensurate if n! 1 + m! 2 = 0 for some n; m 2 Z. ! 1 and ! 2 are incommensurate if they are not commensurate. The following lemma is proven in Peterson <ref> [12] </ref>: Theorem 3 (Ergodicity of Rotations of the Circle) Suppose the circle S 0 is rotated through an angle ff, and ff is incommensurate with 2.

Reference-contexts: The system must also be examined over all time, not just at one instantaneous moment, resulting in an immunity to rescalings and dilations of time. 5 It should be noted that at least one ergodic measure can be found for any differentiable flow on a compact manifold M <ref> [13] </ref>. For example, the phase space of a linear oscillator can be though of as being composed of an infinite number of integral manifolds, each of which corresponds to a surface of constant energy. <p> Pollicott <ref> [13] </ref> gives the following theorem by Oseledec: Theorem 2 (Lyapunov Exponents) Let f : M ! M be a C 1 diffeomorphism of a compact manifold of dimension n, and let be an ergodic measure. <p> The following definition of easurable entropy is presented by Pollicott <ref> [13] </ref>. Assume that f : M ! M is a C 1 diffeomorphism on a compact manifold.

Reference-contexts: The following alternate definition of ergodicity is cited in <ref> [14] </ref>: Definition 4 (Ergodicity) Given the mapping f : M ! M, any invariant set A of the mapping f , and a measure , then f is ergodic with respect to if (A) = 0 or 1. <p> From Ruelle <ref> [14] </ref>, we can consider the case in which f is a differentiable map, giving us the time evolution x (n + 1) = f (x (n)): (11) We then label the Jacobian D x f = (@f i =@x j ), yielding: T n where f n = f ffi f <p> At p = 4 (and most of the other values for which p &gt; 3:57 : : :) the system exhibits chaoticity. For the purposes of this section, we will look at the p = 4 case. Consider the homeomorphism of [0; 1] into itself given by (Ruelle <ref> [14] </ref>, p. 41): (x) = arcsinx 1 Then, we define ~ f (x) = ffi f ffi 1 (x) = 2x if x 2 0; 1 fl fi 1 fl (46) The map (46) is a tent map, which preserves the Lebesgue measure 2 m. <p> For (a; b) = (1:3; 0:3), the system no longer demonstrates chaoticity, but rather has an attracting orbit of period 7 (figure 7b). 20 4.3.1 Lyapunov Exponent, Ergodicity Ruelle <ref> [14] </ref> cites a numerical approximation of the Lyapunov exponent 1 for the case (a; b) = (1:4; 0:3) this result is that 1 = 0:42.

Reference-contexts: All other 2-manifolds (of which there are a countably infinite number) have strictly negative curvature. Thus, selecting a random 2-manifold from the space of all 2-manifolds will (almost always) result in the selection of a hyperbolic manifold. (See references in Schleich <ref> [15] </ref>.) Two common and useful models of hyperbolic space are: 1.

Reference-contexts: Time is no longer an absolute quantity, and it may be radically dilated or rescaled by a coordinate change. In such a situation, one must be extremely careful about how a positive Lyapunov exponent should be interpreted. The following example (provided by Schleich <ref> [16] </ref>) clearly demonstrates this fact. Consider the example of the de Sitter spacetime (written with spatially flat hypersurfaces).

Reference-contexts: The geodesics of the hyperbolic manifold are therefore semicircles (since we only consider y 0); straight line geodesics can be considered to be semicircles of infinte radius, and occur in the case of C = 0. 40 B Measure Spaces The material in this appendix was provided by Schleich andWitt <ref> [17] </ref>. It is useful to first define topological spaces before defining measure spaces. Definition: A topological space is a set X and a collection of subsets T satisfying the following properties: 1.

Reference-contexts: For our hyperbolic manifolds, the trajectories are simply geodesics. There is a well-known formulation for calculating the separation of geodesics namely geodesic deviation that we can adapt in order to calculate the Lyapunov exponents of our hyperbolic plane geodesics. Schutz <ref> [18] </ref>, or virtually any other introductory text on general relativity, provides a full derivation of geodesic deviation, but we will just state the final result here.
