Reference-contexts: Multiple access and adapted software tools will extract and present the information to the user in different forms, for example the natural language form of a formal entry may be computed by the syntactic generator. To represent knowledge associated with words, we have chosen typed-feature structures called Y terms <ref> [1] </ref>. With these structures, basic concepts are ordered in a hierarchy which can be extended to whole structures. Thus we can determine if a Y-term is less than another and the unification of two Y-terms is the biggest Y-term which is less than both unified ones.

Reference-contexts: Data Structures 4.1. Blackboard A main caracteristic of our system is the use of an internal representation of the text in the form of a multidimensional lattice (inspired by <ref> [2] </ref>) which play the role of a blackboard for all the modules.

Reference-contexts: It is wellsuited for typographic errors. The phonetic graphic transducer plays the same role by using the phonetic invariant of words. It is wellsuited for spelling errors. The morphological module can also be used for lexical correction <ref> [3] </ref> but its main purpose is to produce an input for the syntactico-semantic p a r s e r , which is in charge of building a decorated structure of the sentences of the text. The parser we use is a dependency-tree transducer designed as a robust parser [4, 5].

Reference-contexts: introduction chapter,.... interface with the outside world: that includes of course the production of a paper form of the text but also, at least as important as the former, the production of the text in some standardized form (for example the form recommended by the TEI <ref> [8] </ref>) which can travel on networks and be legible by most software. This form can also be used to store the text in databases or to pass it on to other software.

Reference-contexts: Even this simple method requires linguistic service: a morphological generator is necessary to produce each correction. But we think that in most cases the good correction can be choosen automatically, according to criterions 1 such as those considered by <ref> [10] </ref>: number of errors in a group: little cat are funny pets must be corrected little cats are funny pets rather than little cat is funny pet; it is better to correct in a way which does not modify the phonetic of the phrase.
