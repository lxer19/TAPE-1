Abstract: We have developed software for the realistic simulation of a single vessel from an angiogram. Initially a parameterized space curve is generated which specifies the path of the vessel in a three-dimensional space. The position of an aneurysm or stenosis along the path of the vessel may then be specified. Finally, the volume of the vessel is constructed along the space curve, and the resultant image is acquired from projection through the vessel volume. This software enables the generation of remarkably realistic angiogram simulations for application in various medical image interpretation studies.
