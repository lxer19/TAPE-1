Abstract: Based on an analysis of the inference rules used, we provide a complete characterization of the situations in which classical and intuitionistic provability coincide. We then examine the relationship of these derivability notions to uniform provability, a restriction of intuitionistic provability that embodies a special form of goal-directedness. We determine, first, the circumstances in which these relations coincide. Using this result, we identify the richest versions of the so-called abstract logic programming languages in classical and intuitionistic logic. We then study the reduction of classical and, derivatively, intuitionistic provability to uniform provability via the addition to the assumption set of the negation of the formula to be proved. Our focus here is on understanding the situations in which this reduction is achieved. However, our discussions indicate the structure of a proof procedure based on the reduction, a matter also considered explicitly elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: Proof. The first part of the theorem is an immediate consequence of the permutability properties of inference rules in intuitionistic sequent calculi established, for instance, in 16 <ref> [Kle52] </ref>: except in the cases mentioned, a right rule can be moved below a left rule in an I--proof, thereby permitting rules to be reordered to produce an O-proof. We sketch an explicit argument for the reader unfamiliar with these permutability results.

Now, even in situations where the proof relation of interest deviates from uniform provability, it may still be possible to utilize the latter notion in structuring proof search.

Reference-contexts: The second question we consider concerns the correspondence between classical and intuitionistic provability on the one hand and uniform provability on the other. Uniform proofs as identified in <ref> [MNPS91] </ref> are intuitionistic proofs restricted so as to capture a goal-directedness in proof search. <p> This viewpoint has been exploited in <ref> [MNPS91] </ref> in describing a proof-theoretic foundation for logic programming. By its very definition, uniform provability is a less inclusive relation than either classical or intuitionistic provability. However, by a suitable restriction of the context, it is possible to obtain a correspondence between these three relations. <p> We observe that the G- and D-formulas defined here subsume the so-called goal formulas and program clauses of Horn clause logic <ref> [MNPS91] </ref>. There is an auxiliary utility to Theorem 7: it has content relevant to defining a multi-formula succedent sequent calculus for intuitionistic logic. <p> rule are used, the second has one in which an _-L and an _-R rule are used and the last has one in which an 9-L and an 9-R rule are used. 2 The notion of uniform provability is useful in identifying logical languages that provide a basis for programming <ref> [MNPS91] </ref>. <p> The only essential difference between the abstract logic programming language given by these classes of formulas and intuitionistic provability and the language of hereditary Harrop formulas studied in <ref> [MNPS91] </ref> is that the logical constant ? is permitted to appear here in goals and program clauses. <p> The language that results from this restriction is closely related to the Horn clause logic that underlies the language Prolog: in particular, it extends Horn clause logic as presented in <ref> [MNPS91] </ref> by including universal quantification in goals and allowing ? to appear in goals and program clauses.

Reference-contexts: However, there are important differences from the classical case. First, the static Herbrandization step is not sound in the new setting <ref> [Nad93, Sha92] </ref>. An alternative approach that can be used in this case is to treat the 9-L and 8-R rules explicitly in proof search and to employ a dynamic form of Herbrandiza-tion to ensure that the required constraints are satisfied by quantifier instantiation terms [Fit90, Nad93, Sha92]. <p> An alternative approach that can be used in this case is to treat the 9-L and 8-R rules explicitly in proof search and to employ a dynamic form of Herbrandiza-tion to ensure that the required constraints are satisfied by quantifier instantiation terms <ref> [Fit90, Nad93, Sha92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One such modification that has been studied in the past is the addition of the negation of the formula that is to be proved to the assumptions <ref> [NL95, Nad96] </ref>. This transformation is sound with respect 2 to classical logic. We characterize the situations in which it also achieves the desired reduc-tion. <p> One approach of this kind that has been considered in the past in conjunction with classical logic <ref> [NL95, Nad96] </ref>. In this approach, the attempt to prove a sequent of the form ! F is transformed into an attempt to prove F ?; ! F instead. As we see below, the indicated augmentation of the antecedent can be made implicit by being built into new inference rules. <p> The virtue of the resulting derivation system is that it provides the basis for a goal-directed proof procedure with the characteristic that the attempt to prove the original goal is restarted with a modified set of premises at certain points in the search <ref> [Gab85, GR93, LR91, Nad96] </ref>. tight constraint on the syntax of formulas. 19 A crucial requirement in using this method is that the described augmentation of the sequent reduce the question of classical provability to that of uniform provability. <p> Proof. It is shown in <ref> [Nad96] </ref> that, if ! F has a C-proof in which no 8-R rule is used, then F ?; ! F has an I-proof. It is also evident that F ?; ! F has an I-proof if ! F has one. <p> However, it can be easily seen that none of the augmented versions of these sequents have an I-proof. 2 It remains only to characterize the situations in which the augmentation suffices to reduce intuitionistic provability to uniform provability. Part of this task has already been performed in <ref> [Nad96] </ref>. In particular, it has been shown there that if G ?; ! G has an I-proof in which no 8-R rule is used, then this sequent also has an O-proof. <p> Proof. The sufficiency of the first restriction on inference rule usage is shown in <ref> [Nad96] </ref> and that of the second restriction follows immediately from Theorem 12. The sufficiency of the third restriction is a consequence of Lemmas 15 and 16 and the observation that an O G -proof for ! G can be translated into a uniform proof for G ?; ! G. <p> A proof procedure based on these observations is described in <ref> [Nad96] </ref> and connections with other previously presented procedures is also discussed there. We observe, finally, that the results of this section are also relevant from the perspective of structuring proof search in intuitionistic logic.

We have also examined the relevance of our results to proof search in classical and intuitionistic logic and to identifying logic programming languages.

Reference-contexts: The first two notions correspond to classical and intuitionistic provability respectively. The sequent calculi that we have used here to characterize these derivability relations are transparently related to those in <ref> [Pra65] </ref>: we have treated antecedents and succedents as multisets rather than sets but have added the contraction rules to realize arbitrary multiplicity of formulas and, in the intuitionistic setting, we do not permit sequents of the form ! that are not derivable in the system of [Pra65]. <p> related to those in <ref> [Pra65] </ref>: we have treated antecedents and succedents as multisets rather than sets but have added the contraction rules to realize arbitrary multiplicity of formulas and, in the intuitionistic setting, we do not permit sequents of the form ! that are not derivable in the system of [Pra65]. Uniform provability corresponds to the existence of an O-proof. This notion indicates the possibility for a goal-directedness in the search for a derivation, with the top-level structure of the formula in the succedent controlling the next step in the search at each stage.

Reference-contexts: Unification must, of course, not lead to the constraint on constants in the 9-L and 8-R rules to be violated. The best way to achieve this effect in the classical setting is to transform the original sequent by a process referred to as Herbrandization in <ref> [Sha92] </ref> that eliminates at the outset all quantifiers that might require a 9-L and 8-R to be used in proof search. Contraction is applicable only to antecedent formulas in the intuitionistic setting. The essential uses of these rules occur in conjunction with the ^-L, 8-L, and -L rules. <p> However, there are important differences from the classical case. First, the static Herbrandization step is not sound in the new setting <ref> [Nad93, Sha92] </ref>. An alternative approach that can be used in this case is to treat the 9-L and 8-R rules explicitly in proof search and to employ a dynamic form of Herbrandiza-tion to ensure that the required constraints are satisfied by quantifier instantiation terms [Fit90, Nad93, Sha92]. <p> An alternative approach that can be used in this case is to treat the 9-L and 8-R rules explicitly in proof search and to employ a dynamic form of Herbrandiza-tion to ensure that the required constraints are satisfied by quantifier instantiation terms <ref> [Fit90, Nad93, Sha92] </ref>. Second, the provisos in Lemma 4 imply that the process for reducing sequents must delay consideration of the rules -L fl I , _-R and 9-R in addition to 8-L fl . <p> is most easily ensured in practice is that there be no universal quantifiers occurring negatively in the antecedent and positively in the succedent|any sequent can be transformed in one that is equivalent from the perspective of classical provability and that satisfies this additional property through the use of Herbrand functions <ref> [Sha92] </ref>. A proof procedure based on these observations is described in [Nad96] and connections with other previously presented procedures is also discussed there. We observe, finally, that the results of this section are also relevant from the perspective of structuring proof search in intuitionistic logic.
