Title: Painting surface characteristics  
Author: Pierre Poulin Alain Fournier 
Affiliation: Dept. I.R.O. Dept. of Computer Science Universite de Montreal University of British Columbia  
Abstract: Surface illumination proceeds according to the strict rules of the reflection model, the light characteristics and the geometry of the scene. To get a given illumination effect on a surface in a fixed geometry, a user must determine the surface characteristics that will produce this effect. This process is part of what is called inverse illumination. In most current modeling systems, the user must rely only on intuition to perform this inverse illumination, which can lead to many modeling/rendering cycles to achieve a satisfactory result. In this paper, we are concerned with the case where lighting effects are not merely a consequence of the geometry, but rather part of the design. We therefore concentrate our efforts on controlling the surface characteristics and present a tool which can reduce considerably the problem of inverse illumination by using a painting paradigm. An interactive system is provided where the user simply applies color points on a surface. The system then attempts in near real time to find the best values for the surface characteristics such that the points will retain their assigned color in the final rendering. Depending on the number of constraints (color points) given by the user, the solution is presented as a non-linear constrained optimization and a constrained weighted least-square fitting. We apply our solution to a simple illumination model using ambient, diffuse and specular components to illustrate our approach.

Reference-contexts: This approach is typical of the direct illumination paradigm commonly used today. Inverse illumination consists of finding automatically values for these parameters. It has been considered a few times before in some different contexts. We summarize here the three systems we know of. Poulin and Fournier <ref> [1] </ref> present a system where a user can control the definition and position of a light source by manipulating highlights and/or shadow volumes produced it. Their system uses simple geometric constraints which lead to a unique solution in real time. <p> Consider the following illumination model: L pixel () = k a S () + k d S ()L d () + (2) This model includes a surface color S and simulates a linear dielectric-conductor ratio (M 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) for the specular reflection. It is more complex than the previous reflection model. Also notice that the coefficients of ambient, diffuse and specular reflections (k a ; k d ; k s ) are the same for all wavelengths. <p> We believe that some additional variables could be added to extend the simple illumination models we used here. The first one is the glossiness. We did not consider it because we used the technique in <ref> [1] </ref> to define the highlights. As previously discussed, a low glossiness value can provide a larger range for initial guesses. It then becomes possible to try to maximize the glossiness in an objective function and therefore to control this variable. Other parameters from more sophisticated illumination models could be investigated.

Reference-contexts: The only surface characteristic used is the surface glossiness (the exponent in Phong-type illumination model) defining the size of a highlight, but it provides no information about the gradient of color in the highlight. Schoeneman et al. <ref> [2] </ref> address the problem of selecting lights and surface reflectances in the context of a global illumination computation with diffuse reflectors. They use inverse illumination to determine the emitted radiances of the lights. In their system a reflectance must first be associated with each surface.

Reference-contexts: In their system a reflectance must first be associated with each surface. The user then paints colors on surfaces in the scene with a tool simulating spray paint. They assume ideal diffuse surfaces and the light radiances are determined only accounting for direct illumination. Kawai et al. <ref> [3] </ref> also use inverse illumination for global illumination in a diffuse environment. They use unconstrained non-linear optimization to find a local minimum of a possibly complex objective function. <p> The real-time hardware rendering with the machine illumination model allows one to see directly the surface change as the color points are added or moved on the surface. From our experience and as Kawai et al. <ref> [3] </ref> indicated, adding more variables to a system usually has the effect of enlarging the domain of possible solutions which makes it easier to converge to a solution. Unfortunately, depending on the contribution of the new variables, they can introduce more local minima.

Reference-contexts: Thus the user has complete control over the final look of the image, but has also full responsibility for illumination coherence, which can require the skills of a master painter. To facilitate that task, Hanrahan and Haeberli <ref> [4] </ref> developed a 3D painting system where a user can paint specific values of surface characteristics directly on points or regions of a 3D model.

Reference-contexts: When a surface element is illuminated, the radiance directly reflected towards the viewer is a function of the illuminants, the scene geometry and the surface parameters. Consider the following popular reflection model <ref> [5] </ref> applied to a surface element illuminated by m lights: L pixel = k a ()L a () + k d () i=1 ! i k s () i=1 ! i (1) where k a () is the quantity of ambient reflection, k d () is the quantity of diffuse reflection,

Reference-contexts: Therefore we cannot treat the solution independently in each wavelength. The constraints in this model are non-linear. We input these constraints and their gradients into CFSQP <ref> [6] </ref>, a general algorithm to solve constrained non-linear optimization problems. 5.2 Initial guess The specular reflection can generate a solution within a very narrow domain (spike). If the initial guess is infeasible for some constraints, CFSQP will attempt to find a feasible starting value but can fail to identify one.
