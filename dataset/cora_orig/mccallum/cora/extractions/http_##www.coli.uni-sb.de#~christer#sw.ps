Reference-contexts: This raises greater demands for accurate description languages, and efficient processing tools, for stroopwa-fels. Previous attempts to these ends suffer from either excessive storage requirements, or poor performance, or both, and generally lack in linguistic motivation. This paper offers a novel solution to these problems. Previous Work In <ref> [v.d. Deeg 1993] </ref>, Jan van den Deeg suggests a description of stroopwafel exploiting their rotational symmetry w.r.t. the vertical axis through the center of gravity. The average over the angular coordinate is stored, rather than the value at each point in the stroopwafel.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Stroopwafels (SW) are becoming an integral part of every-day life for an increasing number of people, as predicted already in 1972 by Syrup Vance <ref> [Vance 1972] </ref>. This raises greater demands for accurate description languages, and efficient processing tools, for stroopwa-fels. Previous attempts to these ends suffer from either excessive storage requirements, or poor performance, or both, and generally lack in linguistic motivation. This paper offers a novel solution to these problems.

Reference-contexts: The work presented in this article was funded by the N3 "Bidirektionale Linguistische Deduktion (BiLD)" project in the Sonderforschungsbereich 314 Kunstliche Intelligenz | Wissensbasierte Systeme. 1 CNF stands for Crunchy Normal Form and describes the crunchyness, the sugar and fat content, etc., at this point of the stroopwafel, see e.g. <ref> [Wafer 1989] </ref>. layer. The two CNF parameter sets will constitute an average over the wafel and stroop layers respectively, at this point on the radius. From these, the CNF values for the entire stroopwafel can be estimated.
