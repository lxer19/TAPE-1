Title: Improved Lower Bound on Testing Membership to a Polyhedron by Algebraic Decision Trees  
Author: Dima Grigoriev Marek Karpinski Nicolai Vorobjov 
Abstract: We introduce a new method of proving lower bounds on the depth of algebraic decision trees of degree d and apply it to prove a lower bound (log N) for testing membership to an n-dimensional convex polyhedron having N faces of all dimensions, provided that N &gt; (nd) (n) . This weakens considerably the restriction on N previously imposed by the authors in [GKV 94] and opens a possibility to apply the bound to some naturally appearing polyhedra.

To handle the case of a convex polyhedron, we introduce in Sections 1, 3 another approach which differs drastically from <ref> [GKV 94] </ref>.

For an m-plane Q ae R n j and a point x 2 R n j denote by Q (x) the m-plane collinear to Q and containing x. <p> Therefore, Theorem 1 implies that the complexity of testing membership to P n;m is bounded by (log N ) &gt; (n log m). We would like to mention that Section 4 of <ref> [GKV 94] </ref> provides a weaker bound (log m) even for algebraic computation trees.
