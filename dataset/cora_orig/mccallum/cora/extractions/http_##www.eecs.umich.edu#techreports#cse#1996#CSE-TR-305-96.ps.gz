Abstract: We report on our preliminary studies of a new controller for a two-link brachiating robot. Motivated by the pendulum-like motion of an ape's brachiation, we encode this task as the output of a "target dynamical system." Numerical simulations indicate that the resulting controller solves a number of brachiation problems that we term the "ladder", "swing up" and "rope" problems. Preliminary analysis provides some explanation for this success. We discuss a number of formal questions whose answers will be required to gain a full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

Arguably, the first great success in this domain must be attributed to Andersson <ref> [1] </ref> whose ping pong playing robot developed a decade ago was capable of beating many humans.

Reference-contexts: We propose a control algorithm which is effective for the first two "slow brachiation" problems|i.e. the ladder and swing up and rope problems|inspired by our reading of the biomechanics literature. Specifically, Preuschoft et al. <ref> [8] </ref> studied the mechanics of ape brachiation and identified a close correspondence between slow brachiation and the motion of a simplified pendulum. <p> Specifically, brachiation is encoded as the output of a target dynamical system|a harmonic oscillator, that we must force the robot to mimic. 2.1 Review of Biomechanics of Brachiation: A Target Dynanmics According to the biomechanics literature <ref> [8] </ref> slow brachiation of apes resembles the motion of a pendulum. Although the ape's moment of inertia varies during the swing according its change of posture, the motion of a simplified pendulum gives a fairly good approximation. <p> Although the ape's moment of inertia varies during the swing according its change of posture, the motion of a simplified pendulum gives a fairly good approximation. We briefly review the characterization of the forward velocity of brachiation using Figure 3 as suggested in <ref> [8] </ref>. m 0 l 0 approximated by a simple pendulum. Consider the dynamics of a simple pendulum with a point mass and a massless link: = l 0 where l is pendulum length and g is the gravitational constant.

Reference-contexts: Of these antecedents, the present study is most reminiscent of the juggling work since our approach to control entails feedback regulation rather than the open loop pre-planned trajectories developed by Mason and Lynch or the AI system developed by Andersson. Raibert's landmark success in legged locomotion <ref> [9] </ref> represents another important influence on the present work. The third author and students have pursued a number of analytical studies of simple hopping machines that are directly inspired by his work addressing such questions as regulation of hopping height [6], forward velocity [11] and duty factor [12]. <p> Before proceeding, we mention some previous instances of task encoding based on a good understanding of the intrinsic dynamics of a system and an environment. The first example of task encoding is in the control of legged locomotion by Raibert <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> First, we show that the natural dynamics of the two-link brachiating robot admit a reverse time symmetry, S. Then, we give a condition under which feedback laws result in closed loops that still admit S. Lastly, following Raibert <ref> [9] </ref>, we introduce the notion of the neutral orbits of the symmetry, and show how they may be used to solve the ladder problem. In the sequel, we will denote the integral curve of a vector field f by the notation f t .

Reference-contexts: They considered the swing up problem of an underactuated system similar to the two-link brachiating robot we treat in this paper. Their control algorithm pumps energy to the system in an instance of Spong's more general notion of partial feedback linearization <ref> [14] </ref> directed toward achieving a kind of target dynamics whose motions solve the swing up problem. <p> A system is inverted then forced to have the characteristic of some target dynamics. The application of this idea to the two-link brachiating robot is presented. 2.2.1 Partial Linearization of Underactuated Lagrangian Systems Let us generalize slightly Spong's notion of partial feedback linearization in <ref> [14] </ref> as follows. Suppose a plant _w = F (w; v) (7) is input/output linearizable.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, we have adapted his use of a reverse time symmetry to our problem setting. Amidst the large and growing controls literature on underactuated mechanisms, this work is closest in method to Spong and his students' studies of the "Acrobot" <ref> [15] </ref>. They considered the swing up problem of an underactuated system similar to the two-link brachiating robot we treat in this paper.

Reference-contexts: A robotics version of this problem has been previously introduced to the literature by the second author and colleagues <ref> [16, 17] </ref>. They presented the machine we model here with a set of discrete evenly spaced bars and the requirement to swing up from rest, catch the next bar, and then swing from bar to bar by pumping up energy in a suitable fashion. <p> The controller we introduce here bears many similarities to this although the more extended problems of slow brachiation require a rather differently conceived notion of target dynamics. 3 Finally, we must mention the initial success in robot brachiation achieved by the second author and his student Saito <ref> [16] </ref>. They first studied the control problem of a two-link brachiating robot using a heuristic learning algorithm to formulate a control law. They also built a physical two-link brachiating robot and experimentally demonstrated the validity of the control law. <p> Note that we have a torque input only to the second joint. B Practical Feasibility We consider the practical feasibility of the proposed algorithm for a typical robot configuration. Here we consider the two-link brachiating robot built by Saito <ref> [16] </ref>. The arm length is 0:5m and the total weight is 4:8kg (unfortunately the precise parameters are not known since their algorithm does not need a model of the robot). The maximum torque of the actuator is 14Nm and its rated power is 20:3W.
