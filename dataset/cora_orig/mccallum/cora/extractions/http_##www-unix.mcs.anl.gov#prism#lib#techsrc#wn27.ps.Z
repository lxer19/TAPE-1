Abstract: We introduce a simple uniform structure of elementary -unitary matrices. Elementary -unitary transformations are the extentions of Householder transformations in real and complex spaces with a definite or an indefinite inner product induced by a nonsingular signature matrix . The extentions are found useful in the computations of complex matrices or special structured matrices. For two (complex) vectors a and b, we present the sufficient and necessary conditions on the existence of an elementary -unitary transformation U such that U a = b. And we discuss some impacts of the theory on matrix computations involving -unitary transformations.

Reference-contexts: Given a vector, a Householder transformation is applied to introduce certain zero elements in the transformed vector. A sequence of Householder transformations is most often used in algorithms such as the QR factorization and reductions of dense matrices to various condensed forms <ref> [1] </ref>. Mathematical and numerical properties of both the real and complex Householder matrices and transformations are well understood.

Reference-contexts: It is also known all along that this does not necessarily extend to the case of a; b 2 C n <ref> [2] </ref>. Nevertheless, there is always an elementary unitary transformation U such that U a = b and U H b = a. A matrix is elementary if it is a rank-1 modification to the identity matrix [3]. Elementary non-Hermitian unitary transformations fl Duke University, Department of Computer Science. <p> If a and b are complex, there exists no such a Householder transformation if a H b is not real <ref> [2] </ref>. Nevertheless, we will show that there always exists an elementary unitary transformation U such that U a = b. We will need the following lemma several times. The proof of the lemma is elementary and is hence omitted.

Reference-contexts: Let be a nonsingular signature matrix, namely, is a diagonal matrix with 1 diagonal elements. fl A matrix U is unitary with respect to , or simply -unitary, if U H U = <ref> [8] </ref>. Unitary matrices are the special case of = I.

Reference-contexts: Hyperbolic rotations are well-known 2 fi 2 -unitary transformations with = diag (1; 1), they have been used to efficiently implement down-dating of various matrix factorizations [9,10,11,12,13]. In comparison, hyperbolic Householder transformations were first used in linear algebra algorithms by Bunse-Gerstner <ref> [14] </ref> for a theoretical interest in generalizing the QR algorithm for eigenvalue problems. They were further studied and proposed by Rader and Steinhardt [8,15] to use in practical computing such as in solving signal processing problems with least-squares-based adaptive methods. <p> The hyperbolic Householder matrices used are of the Hermitian form ~ H = 2yy H , y H y = 1, cf., for instance, <ref> [14] </ref> and [8]. As for elementary unitary transformations, the Hermitian property needs to be relaxed as well for elementary -unitary transformations in a complex space. In addition, there are elementary -unitary matrices of the form fiyy H with y 6= 0 but y H y = 0, when 6= I.

Reference-contexts: In matrix computation practice, b is often chosen a multiple of the unit vector e 1 . The multiplier can be any scalar, it can be chosen for an easily obtained better numerical property <ref> [16] </ref> or for a more convenient algorithm arrangement in complex matrix computation [5,4,18].

Reference-contexts: An elementary unitary transformation can be called a circular transformation not only for its unitary property that the trasformed vector is the same Euclidean length and hence on the same circle or hyper-circle, but also for its elementary property that the component of a vector along the basis vector y <ref> [17] </ref> is altered by a unit or `circular' factor, e i (2 arctan (fl)) , while its component in R (y) ? remains the same. Since the unit factor is completely determined by fl, we may call fl the circular factor. <p> If all transformations are Hermitian, then D = I=2, and G can be determined by Y only; oth erwise, ffl j g j=1:k are needed. The theory here can also lead to an extension of the basis-kernel representation for orthogonal matrices <ref> [17] </ref>. We are now in a position to promote an alternative and equivalent uni form form for -unitary matrices.
