Abstract: Implementations of systems based on distributed agent architectures require an agent communications language that has a clearly defined semantics. Without one, neither agents nor developers can be sure what another agent's commitment to perform a task means (to name just one speech act). This paper demonstrates that a semantics for an agent communications language can be founded on the premise that intera-gent communications constitute a task-oriented dialogue in which agents are building, maintaining, and disbanding teams through their performance of communicative acts. This view requires that definitions of basic communicative acts, such as requesting, be recast in terms of the formation of a joint intention | a mental state that has been suggested underlies team behavior. Thus, a model of teamwork based on joint intentions is shown to provide the coherence for interagent dialogue, and provides motivation for its step-by-step progression in virtue of the performance of communication actions. To illustrate these points, a semantics is developed for a number of communication fl This research was supported by a grant from the New Energy Development Organization (Japan) and by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (contract number DABT63-95-C-0007) of the Department of Defense. The results presented here do not reflect the position or policy of the either the Japanese Government or the US Government.

Reference-contexts: Mutual belief also satisfies the JPG, allowing the agents to drop the associated WMG. With this last requirement discharged, the team is dissolved. 6 Application of the Theory Many researchers have asserted that interagent dialogue follows a finite state grammar model <ref> [FFMM94, BDBW95, WF88] </ref>. These theories build finite state grammars based on observed regularities in dialogue; questions are followed by answers, requests are followed by acceptances or refusals, assertions are followed by conformations, etc. Grammar based theories assert that dialogues are built from sets of these sequences.

Reference-contexts: y :q)] (WMG x y p)) The characteristics embedded in the WAG and JPG are necessary to allow teams to have coherence by balancing the responsibilities an individual has towards the team with the requirement that an individual team member be allowed to drop a goal under certain reasonable conditions <ref> [CL91] </ref>. If an agent discovers the goal has been accomplished or is impossible, or if he discovers the relativizing condition is no longer true, he is allowed to drop the goal. <p> However, the agent is still left with a goal to make his discovery mutually believed by the rest of the team.

Reference-contexts: There is no need to have a large extendible set of primitive communication acts in the language. When new capabilities are required, they can be built (by composition) from the existing set of communication acts. The reader is referred to <ref> [CL95] </ref> for additional examples of the compositionality of these communication acts. Since all the paths that lead to state 8, leave all parties free of team obligations and all goals discharged, 8 is a final state. The dialogue has been brought to a successful conclusion.

These theories build finite state grammars based on observed regularities in dialogue; questions are followed by answers, requests are followed by acceptances or refusals, assertions are followed by conformations, etc. Grammar based theories assert that dialogues are built from sets of these sequences. <p> Our formalization of communication-acts, based on joint-intention theory, provides explanations for the state transitions and for the dialogue units in finite state grammar models. As an illustration of this, we will examine the Winograd and Flores' basic conversation for action <ref> [WF88] </ref>, showing how the behavior of this model of dialogue is explained by our model of interagent communication. The diagram representing the conversation is reproduced as Figure 2. The diagram is easy to follow and may indeed describe the basic flow of a task oriented dialogue. <p> Winograd and Flores also claim the conversation being modeled is "directed towards explicit cooperative action" <ref> [WF88, pg. 65] </ref> These claims are made without proof or explanation. Our formalization of communication acts, based on joint intention theory, provides the justification for Winograd and Flores' classification, and show the transitions in the figure are correct, and makes explicit the type of cooperative action the dialogue implements. <p> Winograd and Flores state the initial request, moving the dialogue from state 1 to state 2, represents a request stating some conditions of satisfaction (their emphasis <ref> [WF88, pg. 65] </ref>). In our model this is a request of the form (REQ A B e p q). A is requesting that B perform some action p with respect to a relativizing condition q. <p> The original speaker can also withdraw the request before a response, or can modify its condition. <ref> [WF88, pg. 65] </ref> The paths representing the hearer rejecting the task are the paths leading to state 8, namely 1 2 8 and 1 (2 6) fl 2 fl 8. The first of these is clearly the exact sequence of acts that allow the application of Theorem 1.
