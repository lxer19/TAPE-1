Abstract: This paper introduces a new way of describing ontologies used in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) which is intended as a means to allow interoperability of MAS. It is inspired by a pragmatic theory of in-tensionality worked out as part of an anthropological approach to agent migration. An agent observing an unfamiliar society of agents can ascribe such an ontology to that MAS by interviewing those agents, somewhat in the way a social-anthropologist does in fieldwork practice. We present this new form of ontology which is based on the concept of subjective intensionality, concentrating particularly on individual terms. We also discuss how an agent can ascribe this sort of ontology to a society it does not know. Moreover, we formalise some of these ideas using a framework for formalisation of agent theories, based on the Z formal specification language. Further, we compare our proposal to other current approaches to ontology. We conclude by stating our expectations from this work concerning the foundational aspects of interaction among disparate agencies.

Reference-contexts: We have argued its likely superiority to the KQML approach to ontology regarding a particular sort of MAS which is founded on complex aspects of social and cognitive sciences [8]. It is also important from the point of view of believable agents <ref> [1] </ref>, regarding adaptation capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Besides providing these initial thoughts on a suitable theoretical foundation for our project, we claim that research methods in anthropology <ref> [2] </ref> can provide useful techniques for an agent's adaptation to a strange society. Accordingly, we have investigated some techniques currently used by anthropologists in fieldwork practice and discussed how they could be used in the computational counterpart situation. <p> The anthropologist's sentences are either exact translations of sentences of the former type (offered for approval or denial) or sentences expressing suggested correlations between items of data (e.g. "X causes Y") or opinions about significance of items (e.g. "X is very important/peculiar to your society"). Bernard <ref> [2] </ref> gives many examples of good anthropological fieldwork behaviour that can be reduced to such forms.

Reference-contexts: For this particular work, the chosen informant agents should be able to give accurate information about the terms being described by the anthropologist agent. We have argued in <ref> [3] </ref> that our complete project provides a new way of viewing interoperation of MAS. <p> Also, as Luck and d'Inverno claim [11], the framework can be used directly in the implementation of simulations of the agent theories formalised, which is obviously an advantage for further developments of the present work. 4 Discussion 4.1 A New Approach to Interoperability In <ref> [3] </ref> we have devoted a section (called "Contributions to the Critique of KQML") to comparing our approach to interoperability and the KQML approach (see the work on the Agent Communication Language by the Knowledge Sharing Effort [14] 3 ). <p> That is why it is necessary that the anthropologist agent should be able to ascribe ontologies to MAS. We have outlined a theory of intensionality that 3 We give further references to that work in <ref> [3] </ref>. One can also find several papers on that approach at URL http://www.cs.umbc.edu/. can support the creation of ontological descriptions by interviewing informant agents, which is also supported by our ideas on anthropologist agents.

Reference-contexts: Some agents should be able to produce anthropologically-based formal descriptions of the cultures present in all kinds of MAS, which could then be used by migrating agents in their processes of adaptation. Such formal descriptions must include several aspects of a society (see <ref> [4] </ref>); in the current paper we concentrate particularly on the ontological description of terms from the communication language of the society being described. For this particular problem, we propose here the use of a pragmatic theory of intensionality [26]. <p> The sentences in this theory will be submitted to the informant agents in order to check whether they accept the sentences or not. We have argued in <ref> [4] </ref> that an anthropologist agent can use its past experience with other communities in its current fieldwork with an unfamiliar society. This idea also applies for the problem of creating the set of sentences to be used in the interview. <p> We are using this approach in the problem of adaptation of a foreign agent to the collective behaviour of a team of players of the British ball game of cricket <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> Thus, peripherally, this paper suggests that it is helpful to make further investigation of fairly old work on social science as sources of inspiration for open problems in DAI [13,12]. However, we do agree with Gasser [12], as we stated in <ref> [4] </ref>, that the latest theories in social sciences provide the basic principles underlying the appropriate conception of DAI as an inherently social one.

Reference-contexts: issues involved in migration between different cultures, we think our approach is more suitable for the sort of MAS influenced by deep theories of social sciences that can be used by researchers in "human" disciplines akin to DAI for simulation of complex social phenomena, as claimed by Conte and Castelfranchi <ref> [8] </ref>. 4.2 The Context of the Project To make use of the anthropological scheme we have outlined elsewhere, an anthropologist agent must first be in possession of information relevant to the modelling of the MAS. <p> In particular, ontological commitment is fundamental for cooperation of information agents [17,10]. We have argued its likely superiority to the KQML approach to ontology regarding a particular sort of MAS which is founded on complex aspects of social and cognitive sciences <ref> [8] </ref>. It is also important from the point of view of believable agents [1], regarding adaptation capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Our approach can be seen as a step towards the solution to the problem of ontological mismatch among information agents. By information agents we mean both mediators to databases [17,28,27] or agents for gathering information in the Internet <ref> [10] </ref> acting as a MAS. We shall provide the necessary background for both parts of our studies (the anthropological and the semantic/pragmatic sides) in Section 2. Section 3 presents our approach to the problems introduced above and a formalisation of our concept of ontology. <p> We agree that the KQML approach may turn out to be very useful for work on particular kinds of MAS (e.g. the information agents in <ref> [10] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: We consider here only this sort of sentences. The use of logical connectives within this quasi-intensional approach is given in [26]. We now present the definition of an InformantAgent which is built on the definition of AutonomousAgent which is part of Luck and d'Inverno's framework (see, e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>). <p> Finally, we remark that this sort of modular formalisation and the availability of the specification of some general agent notions provided by the framework allowed a clear specification of our ideas on ascription of ontologies for MAS. Also, as Luck and d'Inverno claim <ref> [11] </ref>, the framework can be used directly in the implementation of simulations of the agent theories formalised, which is obviously an advantage for further developments of the present work. 4 Discussion 4.1 A New Approach to Interoperability In [3] we have devoted a section (called "Contributions to the Critique of KQML")

Reference-contexts: We have argued in [3] that our complete project provides a new way of viewing interoperation of MAS. We have compared it to the KQML approach to interoperability <ref> [14] </ref>, and we shall do the same, regarding particularly the ontological aspect, in Section 4.1. 2.2 Subjective Intensionality This section briefly describes the idea of intensionality in meaning. Our approach is motivated by the notion of mental states of language users. <p> developments of the present work. 4 Discussion 4.1 A New Approach to Interoperability In [3] we have devoted a section (called "Contributions to the Critique of KQML") to comparing our approach to interoperability and the KQML approach (see the work on the Agent Communication Language by the Knowledge Sharing Effort <ref> [14] </ref> 3 ). We agreed with Cohen and Levesque's critique that KQML needs further semantic clarification [7], but we have further expanded it in the light of our ideas on interoperability.

Reference-contexts: The activity of an anthropologist agent ascribing ontologies to communities of agents resembles the multidisciplinary subject of ethnography of communication (see, e.g., [16]), and is its computational counterpart. 3.2 A New Kind of Ontology We here take "ontology" to mean very much the same as proposed by Gru-ber <ref> [15] </ref>, i.e. the definition of a set of representational terms 1 (stated as a logical theory). However, we recall that the theory of intensionality presented here deals only with individual terms. <p> It is important to appreciate that not all predicates that hold for the term are needed for an ontological description of it (this is the difference between knowledge representation and commitment to ontological conventions <ref> [15] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Once the anthropologist agent has an initial theory obtained from at least one informant agent, it can proceed with the interview as described before.

Reference-contexts: The material presented here is concerned with the meaning of individual terms. The definitions in this section are presented in detail elsewhere [26]. They are based on the work of R.Martin <ref> [22] </ref>. Roughly speaking, the intension of an expression is what is known about it in order to identify the object/entity to which it refers. We can say that intension is related to notions of mental entities, properties, relations, and concepts, while extension is related to objective entities (objects, structures). <p> We now present some definitions that we use later in Section 3. In order to define subjective quasi-intensions, the acceptance relation between agents and expressions is introduced. The definition, originally described in <ref> [22] </ref>, follows. Definition 1 (Acceptance Relation). Acceptance is an empirical relation, observed by an experimenter who asks questions by means of a set of sentences which represent a logical theory.

Reference-contexts: The simple terms and categories of Conceptual Dependency Theory <ref> [23] </ref>, which is already well known in AI, have the right level for this job. It is desirable for any design of agents intended for use in a community of agents to include some such "pidgin" feature if the community is to accept new agents during its lifetime.

Reference-contexts: We use the framework for formalisation of agent theories specifically, which was elaborated by Luck and d'Inverno [11,19-21] based on the Z formal specification language <ref> [24] </ref>. We assume some familiarity both with the framework and with Z notation.
