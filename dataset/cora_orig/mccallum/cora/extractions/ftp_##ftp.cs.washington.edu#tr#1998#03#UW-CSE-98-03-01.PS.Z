Abstract: One of the challenges of developing a visual language for human-to-human communication is coming up with a large enough visual vocabulary that users are not overly limited in the meanings they can express. If a language system can provide extension mechanisms directly to its end users, then the language, or various dialects of it, can grow with their use. Using an experimental prototype of a visual language called Vedo-Vedi, we present a mechanism that permits its users to define new objects, new icons for those objects, and relationships among those objects. The defined objects can be used to fill slots in frames that represent visual sentences, and they take places within a hierarchical menu system. One of the challenges of providing such an extension mechanism for a visual language is making it easy for users to define new icons, even if they are not comfortable with artistic drawing tools. In Vedo-Vedi, users can create new icons by selecting arbitrary rectangular regions within special images provided for the purpose, or for that matter, within any of the more than 80 images used in the system. Other possible extension mechanisms are also discussed along with implementation and performance issues.

Reference-contexts: Those created or proposed for interpersonal communication rather than for control of computers are very few and limited. Beardon <ref> [1] </ref> has proposed the use of diagrams representing case frames for human communication. Various systems for authoring of multimedia presentations can be considered to be visual scripting languages for human communication. However, these systems produce documents which must be "played" rather than read.

Reference-contexts: The important question of how new icons can be easily created when needed in a visual language was addressed by Repenning for the case when the new icons are geometric transforms of existing ones <ref> [2] </ref>. A related technique is used in the Vedo-Vedi system reported here. 2 The Vedo-Vedi System Vedo-Vedi is a visual language that permits graphical messages to be composed, "explained" (via sim ple animations), sent through the Internet, viewed, and translated into various natural languages.

Reference-contexts: Various systems for authoring of multimedia presentations can be considered to be visual scripting languages for human communication. However, these systems produce documents which must be "played" rather than read. Visual languages for animation include systems like CAEL <ref> [4] </ref>, which tend to concentrate on control of geometry, lighting, and motion, rather than story elements. At VL'97, one of us presented a survey of past work in visual languages for human-to-human visual communication along with a collection of research issues needing attention [3].
