Title: The Weighted Finite Automaton Inference Problem  
Author: B. Litow and O. de Vel 
Date: February 27, 1995  
Abstract: Weighted finite automata (WFA) were introduced as a device for generating and transforming pixel images. The inference problem is the determination of a WFA that generates a given image. There are two basic results in this paper. First, a general solution to the inference problem is given which always yields a minimum state WFA for any image. This algorithm uses only addition and inner products of vectors. Second, a connection between the inference problem and basic computational algebraic geometry is established.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Weighted finite automata (WFA) were introduced in [5] as a device for generating and transforming pixel images. WFA have also been used as a means for computing real valued functions [3]. There are several papers reporting a continuing investigation into WFA based image processing, e.g., <ref> [4, 6, 2] </ref>. As will be seen shortly, WFA are a simple extension of the usual notion of finite automata (FA). This extension is clearest when FA are presented in transition matrix form, rather than in the typical transition graph format.

This extension is clearest when FA are presented in transition matrix form, rather than in the typical transition graph format. WFA can be used for image compression <ref> [4, 2] </ref>. The idea is that some images can be generated by very much smaller WFA. Image compression leads directly to the WFA inference problem. Definitions and discussion of the relevant formal notions are presented in Section 2. <p> However, this definition is incomplete because it is not clear what `minimal' is to mean. Unlike FA, the size of a WFA depends not only on the number of states, but also on the sizes of its weights. In the literature <ref> [6, 2] </ref> WFA size has been taken to mean fewest possible states without regard to the weights. We propose the following as the definition of WFA size in the case of rational weights. <p> This is another largely open area.

Reference-contexts: We speculate for a moment. This approach raises the interesting possibility of encoding rational images by WFA with algebraic weights. It could happen that the specification of these weights might be more efficient than restricting oneself to rational WFA. This is perhaps not entirely unreasonable, e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>. It is worth pointing out that the determination of whether or not a solution exists can also be carried out using Grobner basis calculations. This is discussed in [7, 1].
