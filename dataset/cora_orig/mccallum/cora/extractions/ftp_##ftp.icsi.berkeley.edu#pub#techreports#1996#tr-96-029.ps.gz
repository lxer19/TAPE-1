Abstract: Providing reliable multimedia services requires considerable effort with currently available hardware and software. Major difficulties are to cope with the changing quality of service parameters. Network as well as the operating system can handle these requirements and share resources optimal among several active multimedia applications only if proper information about traffic characteristics are available. The traffic characteristics also helps to improve application performance in terms of the execution time and required resources. Therefore, monitoring traffic is an essential step to support performance management in any network. However, because of the dynamic traffic behavior, the on-line monitoring and the on-line analysis of values becomes more important in real-time communication. In this technical report, a toolkit, called JAM (Java toolkit for traffic analyzing and monitoring) is introduced. JAM allows the user to configure a multimedia conference and to collect performance statistics for different protocol layers and provides a graphical user interface for on-line visualization of statistics gained from a running multimedia session.

Reference-contexts: Traffic requirements and behavior are permanently subject to change as users activities and resource utilization vary in an unpredictable manner. Network as well as the operating system can handle time requirements and share resources optimal among several active multimedia applications only if proper information about traffic characteristics are available <ref> [1] </ref>. To provide this information the service user has to know what the demand on resources for a certain real-time application is. The information about the traffic generated by an application also helps to improve its performance in terms of the execution time and required resources.

Reference-contexts: Hence, we were concerned with gathering information from different protocol levels from the application to the transmission level. As an application platform, we used MBone toolkit <ref> [2] </ref>, vic and vat. The MBone is a transmission standard for multimedia applications (audio, video, text boards) across IP networks. The MBone uses multicasting for data transmission. Anyone connected to the MBone can create a conference, which can be joined by any other user at any time.

Reference-contexts: In this technical report, a toolkit, called JAM (Java toolkit for traffic analyzing and monitoring) is introduced. JAM allows the user to configure a multimedia conference and to collect performance statistics for different protocol layers. JAM is implemented by M arz in his Master's Thesis at ICSI <ref> [3] </ref>. JAM's graphical user interface is implemented in the programming language Java, an object-oriented programming language developed by SUN Microsystems Inc.. This interface provides mechanisms for an on-line visualization of various performance parameters.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we will give the necessary background information about RTP and the programming environment Java, helping to better understand the JAM's design concept. All tools implemented to gather statistics about RTP-based traffic from different protocol levels are introduced in Section 3. 2.1 The Real-time Transport Protocol RTP <ref> [4] </ref> is proposed by the Internet engineering task force (IETF) as a protocol for encoding data with real-time character. RTP is not dependent on particular address formats and can run on top of any transport protocol that the framing mechanisms provide.

Reference-contexts: Both reports have the same data structure, except the SR has additional information about the sending behavior of the session member issuing this SR. This feature of RTCP was used by JAM to gather information about the traffic at the application level. 2.2 The Java Programming Environment Java <ref> [5] </ref> is the object-oriented programming language developed by SUN Microsystems Inc. designed to deliver executable content over networks. Java improves the world wide web interactivity by providing the ability to display information in the form of animation and interactive applications called Java applets.
