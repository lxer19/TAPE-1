Title: Accommodating GB Theory for Dutch by using Pappi  
Author: Tim van der Avoird 
Date: March 1, 1993  
Abstract: The main goal of this research project is the implementation of Dutch in Pappi, a principles and parameters parser. We notice that the linguistic (GB) literature does not offer useful solutions for Verb Second, an important phenomena which can be found in Dutch. We come up with new proposals for the analysis of Dutch in particular and V2 languages in general which do not affect the parsing results of other languages in the system and enable the system to parse a number of main constructions for Dutch. The introduction of the Null Comp Parameter plays an important role in the distinction

Reference-contexts: Another problem comes from examples like (29). This is a Faroese sentence from Barnes <ref> [1] </ref>. (29) Henni tokti batin ringan `She thought that the boat was bad.' It can be shown that there is no element in this sentence which carries nominative Case, although the verb "tokti" has moved to the complementizer position.

Reference-contexts: The representation in Pappi has to be more accurate and unambiguous. Nevertheless, although the nature of the definition of principles is slightly different, the 2 For a complete desciption of the system, see Fong <ref> [8] </ref>. 8 system offers linguists the opportunity to test their linguistic theories in an easy way. <p> 10 Recall the problem we indicated for the determination of the governing category of the finite verb in the C 0 position. 11 The following analysis we provide heavily depends on the defintion of the ECP which is used in the system. (37) Antecedent Government Definition 43, page 229, Fong <ref> [8] </ref> An element S is antecedent governed if there exists a local binder P such that there is no intervening barrier . 23 We will have to consider another solution for the problem of Case assignment to the Spec of CP position. <p> The following defintions of Case Theory can be found among the principles which are used in the system. 12 (39) Structural Case Assignment (Definition 32, pag. 226, Fong <ref> [8] </ref>) A head X assigns Case C at S-structure to an NP S under the following conditions: a. X is a structural Case assigner that assigns Case C, and b. X governs S, and c. <p> X is a structural Case assigner that assigns Case C, and b. X governs S, and c. X is adjacent to S if language parameter CaseAdjacency holds. (40) Case Filter (Defintion 37, pag. 228, Fong <ref> [8] </ref>) At S-structure, every lexical NP needs Case. (41) Trace Case conditions (Definition 39, pag. 228, Fong [8]) a. All Wh-traces must have Case. b. No NP-trace can have Case. <p> X governs S, and c. X is adjacent to S if language parameter CaseAdjacency holds. (40) Case Filter (Defintion 37, pag. 228, Fong <ref> [8] </ref>) At S-structure, every lexical NP needs Case. (41) Trace Case conditions (Definition 39, pag. 228, Fong [8]) a. All Wh-traces must have Case. b. No NP-trace can have Case. If we reject the idea of Case assignment from the C 0 position we will have trouble fulfilling the requirement set by the Case Filter (40). <p> This coindexing is caused by movement only. (43) Case Criterion Every chain has one and only one Case-marked position. (44) Case Realization Abstract Case is realized always on the head of the chain.

Reference-contexts: Heeft ie morgen zijn huiswerk klaar? b. * Heeft morgen ie zijn huiswerk klaar? `Will she have finished her home work tomorrow?' Vikner <ref> [19] </ref> indicates that conditional clauses and clauses of the as if-type provide also supporting evidence for our second assumption. These clauses show the same phenomena that we already saw in example (13). They seem to be a specific instance of our "complementary distribution" account. <p> Example (30) comes from West Flemish, taken from Bennis and Haegeman [2]. (30) a. : : : da Pol zat is. `: : : that Pol is drunk.' b. : : : dan Pol en Valere zat zijn. `: : : that Pol and Valere are drunk.' Vikner <ref> [19] </ref> points out that Tomaselli has to assume that nominative is assigned from I 0 if the subject has a -role, where as it is assigned from C 0 if the subject is non-referential pro. <p> It is hard to see what CPs in V2 languages are predicates of. Moreover, it is awkward to assume that all main clauses in V2 languages are predicates and propositions at the same time. * Vikner's mixed approach Vikner <ref> [19] </ref> combines the Case assignment analysis and the [+I] analysis which we both examined above. He assumes that nominative Case is assigned (under government) from C 0 . But he notices that this assumption is not sufficent to cause the finite verb to move to C 0 .
