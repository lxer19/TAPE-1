Reference-contexts: The halo dark matter density and flux in Equations 1.1 and 1.2 is enhanced by gravitational clustering by a factor of ~ 10 5 over the mean density of an = 1 universe <ref> [20] </ref>. This dark matter density may also be enhanced even more by trapping in the gravitational field of the sun or earth [21][22][23], but significant trapping at these low velocities 1 has been found to be unlikely [24][25]. <p> Such light monopoles warrant high altitude direct searches with solid state detectors or plastic scintillator detectors. However, due to a widely-accepted galactic magnetic field survival argument by Parker <ref> [20] </ref>, such light monopoles (m x = 10 4 GeV) are unlikely to contribute more than one part in 10 17 of the galactic 46 halo dark matter, and therefore the urgency of this search seems to fade. 2.5 Strange Quark Nuggets Witten [58] has predicted that baryonic matter with roughly <p> Of course, these particles have been searched for indirectly before, via astrophysical reasoning (e.g., the exquisite Parker limit for monopoles <ref> [20] </ref>, or cannibalization of neutron stars by CHAMP black holes [66]) or via experiment (e.g., for m x &lt; 10 6 GeV, an invalid but somewhat direct neutraCHAMP search by charge exchange in plastic etch detectors [17][59][60], and also for m x &lt; 10 6 GeV, a search by Adams et

Reference-contexts: Even if WIMPs (with very small cross-sections) are eventually detected by the deep underground searches, it will still be very difficult to extract information about the 5 with non-relativistic velocities at the time of the decoupling of the background radiation from matter 23 WIMPs' characteristics <ref> [26] </ref> (e.g., velocity both magnitude and direction, and mass). If WIMPs are the DDHM, and IMPs are a very minor component of the halo dark matter, IMPs might still be much easier to detect and to characterize (velocity, mass, and interactions).

Reference-contexts: Second, the Galactic halo may be somewhat flattened already <ref> [27] </ref>, possibly due to dissipation of energy by the dark matter objects. Therefore, due to these caveats, the maximum slowing rate determined by Starkman et al. might be too low, and our IMP parameter space not as well constrained.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, since the earth is not perfectly transparent to some dark matter objects 2 , the rotation of the earth about its axis will cause a shadowing effect, causing a diurnal modulation of the dark matter flux <ref> [30] </ref> (see Appendix C). If by some means one can show that a particular dark object 3 exists and has sufficient mass density to account for the density in equation 1.1, then they will have solved the Galactic halo dark matter problem. <p> This pre-flight calibration convinced us that the ADCs were monotonic, linear to within 25%, had little inter-channel crosstalk with thresholds set above ~ 2 pC, and had an active range roughly between <ref> [2; 30] </ref> pC.

Reference-contexts: These results might imply [73][74] that much of the Galactic halo is composed of sub-stellar massive (baryonic) compact halo objects (MACHOs), such as jupiter-sized planets, neutron stars, brown-dwarfs, asteroids, black-holes, or even dark fractal-like hydrogen clouds <ref> [34] </ref>.

Due to the relatively large binding energy, E B = 25 keV, of neutraCHAMPs, some particle physics theorists reasoned in 1989 [42][82] that if neu-traCHAMPs existed in our Galaxy as `dark' matter at velocities of v ~ 10 3 c, then neutraCHAMPs should easily be able to travel through the <p> This exotic Lyman-ff absorption line and the deuterated Lyman-ff line at 38 keV may be responsible for the pairs of absorption lines seen in X-ray bursts or other unexplained X-ray astrophysics phenomena [63][65][162]-[170]. 42 propagate through the entire atmosphere without losing the neutralizing proton <ref> [42] </ref>. This possibility of detecting neutraCHAMPs at sea-level or even mountain-altitude was our original motivation for looking for IMPs as dark matter candidates. NeutraCHAMPs differ from SIMPs since they have a large inelastic scattering cross-section, inel . <p> Therefore, argon is the only element abundant (1%) in the atmosphere that has large enough A to strip a neutraCHAMP, and for velocities above the threshold velocity of 345 km/s, the cross-section for this reaction <ref> [42] </ref> amounts to ~ 20 kilobarns at velocities only 10% above the threshold velocity. <p> The hatched areas are the IMAX excluded regions, assuming that SIMPs are all the galactic halo dark matter (f d = 1). 144 APPENDIX A CLASSICAL COMPUTATION OF NEUTRACHAMP ENERGY LOSS DUE TO POLARIZATION BY 14 N De Rujula, Glashow and Sarid <ref> [42] </ref> speculate that charged massive particles, euphemistically called CHAMPs, close the universe, and comprise dark galactic haloes. CHAMPs come in two forms, X , with a possible mass range of m x 2 [10 4 ; 10 6 ] GeV. <p> Even in satellite experiments [62], the rate of energy loss needs to be known well, in order to optimize detector response. Previous authors <ref> [42, 65, 82] </ref> only compute estimates of the upper and lower bounds of the energy loss of X p in the atmosphere.

Reference-contexts: In the early universe, the low WIMP cross-section would make it quite likely that enough WIMPs could survive annihilation from anti-WIMPs, so as to be abundant enough to solve the missing matter problem today <ref> [43] </ref>. However, particles which have a much higher annihilation cross-section than WIMPs would not survive annihilation in the early universe, and would therefore not be abundant enough to be a likely dark matter candidate.

Reference-contexts: d is proportional to m x the dependence has dropped out, and we have vertical stripes of f d gray shading. 33 2.1.2 SIMP Constraints from Miniature Black Hole Formation and Subse quent Neutron Star Cannibalization Starkman et al. elaborate upon arguments by Gould et al.[66] and Goldman & Nussinov <ref> [68] </ref> which show that for a wide-range of SIMP masses and cross-sections, SIMPs cannot exist in any abundance because otherwise they would collect at the center of every neutron star, and then form a mini-blackhole (MBH) M ~ 10 12 M fi (the order of an asteroid mass worth of SIMPs), <p> Since we know neutron stars exist and are long lived [88], then SIMPs cannot be very abundant within a very broad range of masses and cross-sections (see Figures 2.3 and 2.4). However, we believe that the SIMP/MBH argument is very model-dependent <ref> [68] </ref> since we can easily envision a SIMP model with SIMPs having enough pressure on the quantum scale to offset the gravitational pressure and prevent formation of the mini-blackhole. <p> For example, if the SIMPs are not elementary particles, but composed of many elementary fermions, as might occur in strange quark nuggets, and if these elementary fermions have a mass much less than ~ 10 8 GeV <ref> [68] </ref>, then the accreted mass of SIMPs necessary to form a black hole might be ~ M fi (strange stars might exist with ~ M fi [101]), rather than ~ 10 12 M fi . <p> Nonetheless, the MBH argument does constrain SIMPs if the SIMPs are elementary particles, especially if the SIMPs are fermions <ref> [68] </ref>[47]. By an extension of the arguments given in References [68], [66] and [47], we compute the maximum SIMP fraction by mass of the Galactic halo, f d , as a function of m x and . <p> The maximum SIMP halo matter fraction is shown in gray-shades as a function of SIMP mass and transport cross-section.

Reference-contexts: First, some models based upon the results of the COBE experiment suggest that cold dark matter (CDM) alone cannot explain the clumping of galaxies; hot dark matter (HDM) (e.g., light neutrinos) might be 30% of all dark matter <ref> [70] </ref>. Therefore, since IMPs would be considered as CDM 5 the IMP number density required to be the DDHM is lowered. Second, the theoretical estimates [42][43] of the mass range for IMPs-as-DDHM might be too low, and the density or flux range too high.

Reference-contexts: If WIMPs are the DDHM, and IMPs are a very minor component of the halo dark matter, IMPs might still be much easier to detect and to characterize (velocity, mass, and interactions). Fifth, recent big bang nucleosynthesis calculations <ref> [71] </ref> have suggested that the Galactic halo dark matter (corresponding to ~ 0:10) cannot be accounted for by dark baryons, since these calculations suggest that 0:015 &lt; Baryon &lt; 0:070. Therefore Non-Baryon, Halo &gt; 0:03, and some effort must be made to determine its identity.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a significant flux of neutraCHAMPs might reach mountain altitude or even sea-level and have observable consequences, like neutral-particle cosmic ray event rates with a sidereal time-dependence [75]-[79], the unusually long pulse-trains seen in early neutrino detectors <ref> [80] </ref>, and excess heat generation in cold-fusion experiments [81]-[84]. This possibility of neu-traCHAMPs explaining previously unexplained terrestial phenomena and simultaneously solving a significant problem in astrophysics (dark matter) interested us keenly in 1989, so we began a mountain altitude search for neutraCHAMPs at that time.

Reference-contexts: elementary fermions, as might occur in strange quark nuggets, and if these elementary fermions have a mass much less than ~ 10 8 GeV [68], then the accreted mass of SIMPs necessary to form a black hole might be ~ M fi (strange stars might exist with ~ M fi <ref> [101] </ref>), rather than ~ 10 12 M fi . This amount of accretion is impossible, so that this MBH argument fails to constrain all different types of SIMPs as dark matter. <p> Such strange quark 'nuggets' (SQNs) are possible relics of the hypothetical quark-gluon plasma phase of the early universe [48], and might also be produced and ejected in supernovae. These conglomerates of strangeness are likely to consist of many quarks, possibly ranging up to even sub-stellar masses (`strange' stars <ref> [101] </ref>), or down to the mass of an ordinary nucleus (e.g. the `H'-particle, an object with 2 strange quarks, with a mass near 2 GeV [111]).

If the SQN is not accompanied by a full cloud of electrons, then the cross-section for SQN interactions will be significantly reduced. If stable strange quark nuggets exist, then they will likely populate the galactic halo at non-relativistic velocities (fi ~ 10 3 ).

Reference-contexts: sometimes reach ~ 300 ns [128][129]<ref> [130] </ref>. Most of the stragglers are likely produced by high transverse momentum (p T ) collisions high in the atmosphere, which give a particle a large angle of descent with respect to the core of the air-shower, causing time-delays by the difference in path-length travelled [130]. Delayed-particles produced by the high p T collisions require detectors with wide lateral separation (i.e., an air-shower array), so these delayed particles would not likely cause correlated pulses in our vertical stack of detectors. <p> If we had more than a few events due to delayed particles in air-showers, the 153 distribution of time-delays observed would likely follow an exponential distribution for the long time-delays (350 ns) of interest <ref> [130] </ref>. Without further information, we probably would not understand the source of these correlated pulses, but they would probably not pass our 4 detector time-of-flight requirement.

Reference-contexts: Afterpulsing usually occurs on a time-scale of less than a few microseconds after the passing cosmic ray <ref> [131] </ref>, and consists of ion bombardment of the cathode and initial dynodes [135].

Fluorescence occurs on a time-scale of a few microseconds to hundreds of microseconds after the deposition of energy by a cosmic ray, while phos-phoresecence occurs on the time-scale of minutes to days <ref> [131] </ref>. Both fluorescence and phosphorescence consist of the de-excitation of molecular states in the faceplate material in the PMT. Some natural level of radioactivity will always be present in the PMT faceplate or in the surrounding detectors and structural support material. <p> The position of the sharp peak seems to be a tube dependent effect <ref> [131] </ref>, and can vary from ~ 0:1s to 0:5s. The exponential component probably comes from the afterpulsing due to ion bombardment or from the afterpulsing due to fluorescence, as discussed earlier. <p> On the time-delay scale of 0:1s and 10s, the PMTs of each detector might afterpulse. Therefore, the time-delay distributions T 12 , T 23 , and T 34 , due to PMT afterpulsing/fluorescence would have a similar shape to the distribution shown in Ref. <ref> [131] </ref>. However, we only measure the time-delays within a certain window (e.g., T 12 2 [0:6; 7:6]s, T 23 2 [1:3; 15:0]s, T 34 2 [0:5; 4:5]s), so the measured distributions will be cut-off, as compared to the distribution in Ref.

Therefore, the initial pulse caused by 158 the cosmic ray will not be registered in any of the four detectors.
