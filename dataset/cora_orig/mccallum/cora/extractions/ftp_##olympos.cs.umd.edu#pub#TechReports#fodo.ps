Abstract: We propose an indexing method for time sequences for processing similarity queries. We use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to map time sequences to the frequency domain, the crucial observation being that, for most sequences of practical interest, only the first few frequencies are strong. Another important observation is Parseval's theorem, which specifies that the Fourier transform preserves the Euclidean distance in the time or frequency domain. Having thus mapped sequences to a lower-dimensionality space by using only the first few Fourier coefficients, we use R fl - trees to index the sequences and efficiently answer similarity queries. We provide experimental results which show that our method is superior to search based on sequential scanning. Our experiments show that a few coefficients (1-3) are adequate to provide good performance. The performance gain of our method increases with the number and length of sequences.

Reference-contexts: There have been several efforts to model time-sequenced data, to design languages to query such data, and to develop access structures to efficiently process such queries (see [25] for a bibliography). Most of the work, however, has focussed on "exact" queries. New emerging applications, particularly database mining applications <ref> [2] </ref>, require that databases be enhanced with the capability to process "similarity" queries. <p> The work reported in this paper has been done in the context of the Quest project <ref> [2] </ref> at the IBM Almaden Research Center. In Quest, we are exploring the various aspects of the database mining problem.

Reference-contexts: In Quest, we are exploring the various aspects of the database mining problem. Besides the problem of queries over large sequences, some other problems that we have looked into include the enhancement of the database capability with the classification queries <ref> [3] </ref> and with "what goes together" kinds of association queries [4]. The eventual goal is to build an experimental system that can be used for mining rules embedded in massive databases. We believe that database mining is an important application area, combining commercial interest with intriguing theoretical questions.

Reference-contexts: Shasha and Wang [24] proposed an indexing method that uses the triangular inequality and some precomputed distances to prune the search. However, the space overhead of the method seems quadratic on the number of objects, which may make it prohibitive for large databases. Aurenhammer <ref> [5] </ref> surveyed recent research on Voronoi diagrams, along with their use for nearest neighbor queries. Although Voronoi diagrams work well for approximate matches in 2-dimensional spaces, they need intricate transformations to work for a 3-d space, and they do not work at all for higher dimensionalities.

Reference-contexts: For example, random walks (also known as brown noise or brownian walks) exhibit an energy spectrum of O (f 2 ) [23], and therefore an amplitude spectrum of O (f 1 ). Stock movements and exchange rates have been successfully modeled as random walks (e.g., <ref> [8, 17] </ref>). Using the data set available through ftp from sfi.santafe.edu, we show in [1] that the Fourier transform of the movement of the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the US dollar follows closely the same 1=f behavior as for a random walk.

Reference-contexts: Our mathematical argument for keeping the first few Fourier coefficients agrees with the intuitive argument of the Dow Jones theory for stock price movement (see, for example, <ref> [9] </ref>). This theory tries to detect primary and secondary trends in the stock market movement, and ignores minor trends.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the Euclidean distance is the optimal distance measure for estimation <ref> [11] </ref>, if signals are corrupted by Gaussian, additive noise. Thus, if ~q is our query and ~x is a corrupted version of it in the database, a searching method using the Euclidean distance should produce good results.

Reference-contexts: For linear quadtrees, the effort is proportional to the hyper surface of the query region <ref> [13] </ref>; the hyper surface grows exponentially with the dimensionality. Grid files face similar problems, since they require a directory that grows exponentially with the dimensional ity. The R-tree based methods seem to be most robust for higher dimensions, provided that the fanout of the R-tree nodes remains &gt; 2.

Reference-contexts: Experiments [21] indicate that R fl - trees work well for up to 20 dimensions. The feature extraction method should therefore be such that a few features are sufficient to differentiate between objects. We propose to use the Discrete Fourier Transform <ref> [20] </ref> for feature extraction. Given a sequence, we transform it from the time domain to the frequency domain. We then index only on the first few frequencies, dropping all other frequencies.

This approach addresses the two problems cited above as follows: * Completeness of feature extraction: Parseval's theorem [20], discussed in Section 2, guarantees that the distance between two sequences in the frequency domain is the same as the distance between them in the time domain. * Dimensionality curse: As we discuss in subsection 3.3, a large family of interesting sequences exhibit strong amplitudes for the first few frequencies. <p> The importance of the DFT is the existence of a fast algorithm, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), that can calculate the DFT coefficients in O (n log n) time.

Reference-contexts: The worst-case signal for our method is white noise, where each value x t is completely independent of its neighbors x t1 , x t+1 . The energy spectrum of white noise follows O (f 0 ) <ref> [23] </ref>, that is, it has the same energy in every frequency. This is bad for the F -index, because it implies that all the frequencies are equally important.

Their energy spectrum follow O (f b ), b &gt; 2, which is even more skewed than the spectrum of the brown noise.
