Title: on Robotics and Automation Agile Assembly Architecture: An Agent Based Approach to Modular Precision Assembly Systems  
Author: Alfred A. Rizzi, Jay Gowdy, and Ralph L. Hollis 
Affiliation: The Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University  
Note: To appear in the Proceedings of the 1997 International Conference  
Abstract: This paper serves to present our initial thoughts on the design of an architecture for highly flexible, modular, and distributed precision assembly systems. Through the use of a unified design, simulation, programming, and monitoring environment coupled with self-representing cooperative agents this architecture will significantly simplify the process of factory design and deployment. Our demonstration of this architecture takes the form of a "table top" sized assembly system targeted at the partial assembly of high-density magnetic storage devices.

Reference-contexts: To facilitate the design and operation of distributed systems of this type, every agent in a minifactory will contain its own computer capable of both representing itself to its peers and providing detailed models (both geometric <ref> [1] </ref> and behavioral) for use in its simulation. To support a suitably extensible simulation environment we expect to make use of distributed models and processing by relying on agents (and their associated computers) to represent their own behavior during simulation.

Reference-contexts: Not surprisingly, the design of general purpose part feeding systems is quite complex and has been the topic of significant independent research <ref> [10, 2] </ref>. Our project is beginning to explore potential solutions that fit our application needs. Finally, it is critical to provide suitably scalable computational and network resources throughout the minifactory environment for both user commands/monitoring, and inter-agent coordination.

Reference-contexts: In principle, either can deliver the needed micron level resolution. A prototype of the magnetic sensor is currently under evaluation, and we expect to evaluate a prototype of the optical sensor in the near future <ref> [3] </ref>. Unfortunately couriers require tethers for the supply of both power and air. This both complicates motion planning for the couriers as well as forcing the inclusion of additional mechanisms and fixtures to support the transfer of partial assemblies between couriers.

Reference-contexts: A minifactory system should be designed and programmed by an expert in the assembly problem at hand without requiring expertise in minifactory programming. Following current trends in the field of machine programming, e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>, the design and programming of a minifactory will be primarily graphical, with as little text interaction as possible. Users should be able to point, click, and drag their way through an intuitive visual interface to create a distributed minifactory program.
