Reference-contexts: This information is captured by three main indicators: 1. the topic, 2. the focus, and 3. the background. In free word order languages, these are indicated by order variations, contrary to fixed word order languages, in which intonation, stress, and/or clefting are used [5]. Erguvanl <ref> [1] </ref>, has examined the word order variations of Turkish sentences. In Turkish, the information which links the utterance to the previous context, the topic, is in the sentence initial position. For example, the topic of sentence (b) below, is the direct object, which is a pronoun: (3) a.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the framework of an ongoing large-scale research project on natural language processing for Turkish, a morphological generation system [12] and a tactical sentence generation system <ref> [3, 4] </ref> have already been designed and implemented for Turkish. A system which produces an interlingua representation from an English sentence was also developed for the KANT project at Carnegie Mellon University-Center for Machine Translation [9, 10]. <p> This selection depends on the preposition, and some semantic conditions. The preposition `for' is a good example for this selection. Further explanation is given in section 5.1. 3.2 Sentence Generation System The sentence generation system was originally designed and implemented by Hakkani et. al. <ref> [3, 4] </ref> to be used in a prototype transfer-based human-assisted machine translation system from English to Turkish [16]. This component is based on a recursively structured finite state machine (much like a recursive transition network) for handling the constituent order variations of Turkish, implemented as a right-linear grammar backbone.

Stys et al. [14] tried to identify word order information analyzing the discourse to generate communicatively adequate sentences in English-Polish machine translation. Hoffman <ref> [6] </ref> present algorithms which use contextual information to determine the topic and focus of Turkish sentences which are translated from English. The mapping system could be extended so that it makes centering analysis or uses syntactic clues, to produce an information structure embedded in the f-structure it outputs.

The Turkish mapping system consists of 178 mapping rules and 227 mapping lexicon entries.

Reference-contexts: The information structure of a sentence captures and encodes the speaker's communicated information relative to his/her beliefs about the hearer's information state <ref> [18] </ref>. This information is captured by three main indicators: 1. the topic, 2. the focus, and 3. the background. In free word order languages, these are indicated by order variations, contrary to fixed word order languages, in which intonation, stress, and/or clefting are used [5].
