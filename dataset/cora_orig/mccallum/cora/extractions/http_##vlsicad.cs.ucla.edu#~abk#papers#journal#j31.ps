Abstract: Elmore delay has been widely used to estimate the interconnect delays in the performance-driven synthesis and layout of VLSI routing topologies. For typical RLC interconnections, Elmore delay can deviate significantly (by up to 33% or more) from SPICE-computed delay, since it is independent of inductance. Here, we develop an analytical delay model based on first and second moments to incorporate inductance effects into the delay estimate for interconnection lines. Delay estimates using our analytical model are within 10% of SPICE-computed delay across a wide range of interconnect parameter values. We also extend our delay model for estimation of source-sink delays in arbitrary interconnect trees. Even for the small tree topology considered, we observe significant improvement of at least 20% in the accuracy of delay estimates when compared to the Elmore model, even though our estimates are as easy to compute as Elmore delay. The speedup of delay estimation via our analytical model is several orders of magnitude compared to simulation methodology such as SPICE.

Reference-contexts: The coefficients of the transfer function are obtained from Equation (10). By contrast, the Elmore delay at the sink is equal to the first moment, or the first coefficient b 1 of the transfer function of the source-sink main path <ref> [14] </ref>. The 90% threshold delay using the first moment is simply T ED (i) = 2:3 fl M 1 (12) which we emphasize can be inaccurate despite its wide use, since it ignores inductance of the interconnect line.
