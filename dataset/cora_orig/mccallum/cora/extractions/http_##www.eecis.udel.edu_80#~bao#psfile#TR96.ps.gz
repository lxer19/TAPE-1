Abstract: The major task of a network is to provide transmission service to different applications with diversified QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. Due to the increasing dynamics of traffic in current network applications, dynamic QoS control is needed to ensure both QoS satisfaction and resource efficiency. In this paper, we present a dynamic QoS control scheme|Buffer-Directed Dynamic QoS Control|which can be used in real-time to adjust the resource allocation based on the feedback of QoS performance. The method can satisfy a diversified combination of delay bound and loss ratio requirements. It is a simple, general QoS control scheme which can be used on a variety of sources. The paper will also discuss how to achieve different control granularities using this method. Simulations show that the scheme can effectively control diversified QoS in an accurate way with good resource efficiency.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic resource allocation needs to be applied to provide real time control of QoS. Bolla, et al. presented a dynamic resource allocation scheme for ATM networks by monitoring the QoS feed 3 back <ref> [RFFM93, BDL + 92] </ref>: the bandwidth allocation is adaptively changed by an allocation con-troller by minimizing a cost function, which takes the overall cell loss and the number of refused connections into consideration.

Reference-contexts: An improved variation of HoL is HoL-PJ (HoL Priority with Priority Jumping), in which the priority of a packet can be changed according to the experienced waiting time in the queue. Chen and Stavrakakis <ref> [CS96] </ref> generalized the HoL-PJ and showed that by tuning the waiting time needed for priority change, one can get desired delay and loss ratio for each class as requested. However, the analysis is based on geometric distribution arrivals and it is computationally intensive even for 2 priorities.

Reference-contexts: However, the analysis is based on geometric distribution arrivals and it is computationally intensive even for 2 priorities. In another variation <ref> [CU95] </ref>, two priorities are assigned to each flow: the departing priority affects the delay performance and the discarding priority affects the loss ratio performance. Scheduling schemes are usually used to satisfy the delay bound/deadline requirements, which is important for real-time traffic.

Reference-contexts: It was also proved that VirtualClock provides conditional delay guarantee for each flow. A delay guarantee exists only when the flow itself is a well-behaved flow, and this delay guarantee does not depend on any other flow <ref> [LX95, GL94] </ref>. For bursty traffic or unpredictable traffic, static resource allocation based on statistical nature of the traffic may not be able to guarantee the QoS performance requirements. Dynamic resource allocation needs to be applied to provide real time control of QoS.

Reference-contexts: It is a flexible scheme for QoS control. GPS (General Processor Sharing) [KG93] is an implementation of weighted fair queueing.

Reference-contexts: It breaks the "absolute" advantages of high priority in the HoL priority method. In rate-based QoS control schemes, a source's traffic is parameterized by a set of statistics such as average rate, maximum rate or peak rate, and burstiness <ref> [KG93] </ref>, which can be checked by the network along with the requested QoS to see if a new source can be accommodated. Once the new source is admitted, the network ensures that the agreed-upon values of traffic parameters are not violated. <p> Stop-and-go queueing preserves the smoothness property as packets travel inside the network and guarantees a worst case delay for each flow. A weakness of the stop-and-go method was pointed out by Parekh and Gallager <ref> [KG93] </ref>: since the delay in stop-and-go is bounded by T |the frame size| which is a global network constant, this method is not flexible in controlling QoS. When T is too small, it ends up as peak rate bandwidth allocation, which results in poor efficiency. <p> Weighted fair queueing divides the server capacity among the flows and the server portions can be adjusted dynamically among the flows. It is a flexible scheme for QoS control. GPS (General Processor Sharing) <ref> [KG93] </ref> is an implementation of weighted fair queueing.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, static QoS control schemes based on some simple traffic descriptors cannot ensure the QoS in an efficient way. Some network 1 applications, such as the newly emerging interactive video and the future residential broadband services <ref> [Kow95] </ref>, may be incapable of predicting their own bandwidth requirements. It is impossible to set a specific amount of resources aside for these applications before the start of transmission to ensure QoS.
