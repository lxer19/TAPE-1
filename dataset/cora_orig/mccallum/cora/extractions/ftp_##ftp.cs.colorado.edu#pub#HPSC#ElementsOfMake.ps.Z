Reference-contexts: Similarly, make assumes a macro named $SHELL that is equivalent to /bin/sh by default. On some of the newer UNIX operating systems, it is possible to change this, by redefining the macro variable: SHELL = /bin/csh 12 Further information For further information on make, you might refer to <ref> [Feldman 86] </ref> or the man pages. This utility is discussed in some C and UNIX textbooks, e.g., [Sobell 84] and [Kay & Kummerfeld 88].
