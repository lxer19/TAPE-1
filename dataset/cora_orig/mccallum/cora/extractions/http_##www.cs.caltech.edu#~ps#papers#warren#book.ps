Reference-contexts: then F defines the infinite sequence of shapes, G i+1 = F (G i ): If F is "well-behaved", then there exists a limit shape G that is a fixed point of F , G = F (G): A good example of this technique are the fractal methods of Barnsley <ref> [Bar93] </ref>. The function F is a collection of affine transformations. If each of the affine transformations in F is contractive (reduces the size of the shape in each dimension), then F has a unique fixed point, G = F (G): G is the fractal associated with F .

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the original scheme is C 1 continuous. 28 CHAPTER 3. CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS FOR UNIFORM SUBDIVISION Chapter 4 Subdivision over irregular knot sequences An extensive theory of univariate subdivision has been developed that relates the combinations used to the smoothness of the corresponding limit curve. <ref> [CDM91, Dyn92] </ref> give a comprehensive survey of this theory. However, this theory was developed with the assumption that the parameterization underlying the subdivision method is uniform, that is the ith control point is associated with a parameter value proportional to i. <p> If the scheme has linearly dependent basis functions, several powers of two may be repeated. This result is a generalization of a similar result for uniform subdivision in <ref> [CDM91] </ref>. 44 CHAPTER 5. UNIVARIATE STATIONARY SUBDIVISION Since the regular four point rule produces C 1 functions, we can now use theorem 14 to show that the irregular four point rule also produces C 1 functions. <p> If n is regularly spaced, then S [n] must be uniform due to affine and index invariance. Since the subdivision rules are locally defined and n has a single non-uniformity, only a finite number of columns of S [n] can deviate from the uniform case. For the uniform case, <ref> [CDM91] </ref> and [DGL94] show that the polynomial t can be reproduced by a vector that is a sample of a linear function over a regular knot sequence.

Reference-contexts: C is a circulant matrix, that is a a matrix in which C i;1 = C (i+k1 mod n)+1;k for all 0 k &lt; n. The spectral properties of circulant matrices are well-understood. Theorem 30 <ref> [Dav] </ref> Let ! be the nth root of unity. Then the circulant matrix C has eigenvalues P n 8.3.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 19 Let ^ D D be a maximal set of direction vectors that do not span R d . Then, the basis function N D (t) is a C k function where k = jDj j ^ Dj 2: For a proof, we refer the interested reader to <ref> [dBHR93] </ref>. If every set of d vector in D are linearly independent , then j ^ Dj = d 1 and N D (t) has smoothness of order jDj d 1. Note that this smoothness is maximal since the basis function is a piecewise polynomial of degree jDj d.

Reference-contexts: Each control 26 CHAPTER 3. CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS FOR UNIFORM SUBDIVISION polygon interpolates the vertices of previous control polygons. Consider the subdivision scheme of <ref> [DGL87] </ref> with generating function S (z) = 16 A portion of subdivision matrix S associated with this process is 0 B B B B B B B B 1 9 9 16 0 0 0 0 1 9 9 16 0 0 0 0 1 9 9 16 0 0 0 <p> This subdivision scheme is simply piecewise linear interpolation. For r = 1, the nonzero portion of the mask m i is ( 16 9 ; 16 1 ): This subdivision scheme is the four-point rule of <ref> [DGL87] </ref>. This method converges to C 1 continuous function. For irregularly spaced n, this scheme has not been studied. Of course for r = 0, the scheme produces piecewise linear interpolation. For r = 1, this scheme produces an irregular four point rule that depends on the local knot spacing.

Reference-contexts: If S j and ffff j are sparse, then Q j is sparse. Unfortunately, the analysis filters derived from the inverse of the matrix need not be sparse. For interpolating subdivision schemes such as linear subdivision and the C 1 "butterfly" scheme of Dyn et. al. <ref> [DGL90] </ref>, the situation is much improved. Such interpolating schemes have the property that S j O is exactly the identity matrix. In this case, equation 9.6 simplifies greatly.

In the case of B-splines of degree n &gt; 0, this theorem can be used to show that the function L [n j ; p j ](t) converge to the B-spline function.

Reference-contexts: Since the subdivision rules are locally defined and n has a single non-uniformity, only a finite number of columns of S [n] can deviate from the uniform case. For the uniform case, [CDM91] and <ref> [DGL94] </ref> show that the polynomial t can be reproduced by a vector that is a sample of a linear function over a regular knot sequence. Since this representation is unique (as assumed at the start of the section), l i must agree with the uniform analysis for large jij.

However, this theory was developed with the assumption that the parameterization underlying the subdivision method is uniform, that is the ith control point is associated with a parameter value proportional to i. <p> Of course, other types of multi-variate subdivision processes are possible besides box splines. In the case of box splines, the generating function S (z) always split into linear factors. If S (z) does not factor, what properties does the subdivision scheme possess? <ref> [Dyn92] </ref> gives a nice analysis of this case using matrix subdivision. If one wishes to derive the box spline basis functions are the limit of the subdivision process, then the coefficients are assigned parameter values over a regular grid.

Reference-contexts: This cascade of analysis steps is often referred to as a filter bank algorithm. The use of multi-resolution representations for curve editing was recently demonstrated by Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [FS94] </ref>. The idea is to allow for changes in the overall sweep of the curve by modifying broad-scale wavelet coefficients; fine-scale changes can similarly be made by modifying only fine-scale wavelet coefficients, as shown in figure 9.2. 9.2 Nested spaces We next derive the general components of multi-resolution analysis.

Reference-contexts: Each neighborhood gives rise to a different subdivision rule for the derivative scheme. The lower portion of the figure shows the two types of subdivision rules associated with the derivative scheme. This derivative scheme is the C 1 cubic half-box spline described in <ref> [Goo90, pp. 359] </ref>. Theorem 27 gives a very general method for constructing difference schemes. Of course, we still must prove that these schemes converge to the appropriate set of derivatives. Unfortunately, we have a proof of such convergence only in the C 0 and C 1 cases.

Reference-contexts: To this end, we use an approach similar to that of Gregory and Qu in <ref> [GQ92, GR94] </ref>. The key is to construct a differencing operator that behaves like a discrete derivative. maps a set of control points for S to a new set of control points for D.

Reference-contexts: However, each new vertex is positioned using a fixed convex combination of the vertices of the original mesh. The final limit surface has a continuous tangent plane. * Figure 1.5 shows an extension of Loop's method by Hoppe et al. <ref> [HDD + 94] </ref> that incorporates sharp edges into the final limit surface. The vertices of the initial polyhedron of the left are tagged as belonging on a face, edge or vertex of the final limit surface. Based on this tag, different averaging masks are used to produce new polyhedra. <p> As in the unbounded case, we have no geometric characterization of when this spectral condition is satisfied. In the pure geometric case, more general types of subdivision rules are possible along boundaries. Hoppe et al. <ref> [HDD + 94] </ref> give an interesting extension of Loop's method. A simple chain of edges on the boundary of a triangular mesh is tagged. Subdivision rules for cubic B-splines are applied on the interior of this chain. The endpoints are interpolated.

Reference-contexts: Each triangular face is split into four subtriangles. New vertices are placed at the midpoints of old edges. 7 * Figure 1.4 shows a subdivision scheme developed by Loop <ref> [Loo87] </ref>. Again, each triangle of a triangular mesh is split into four triangles. However, each new vertex is positioned using a fixed convex combination of the vertices of the original mesh. <p> Of course, these rules should produce a limit surface that is locally the graph of a C k function. In practice, creating a C 1 manifold at the extraordinary points is relatively straightforward. <ref> [Loo87] </ref> gives one such rule for use with the three direction quartic box spline rules mentioned above. [DS78, CC78] give rules for extraordinary points arising during the subdivision of quadrilateral meshes. Proving that the resulting limit surface is a C 1 manifold is fairly difficult.

Lane and Riesenfeld's algorithm <ref> [LR80] </ref> for subdividing a degree n uniform B-spline is roughly as follows: * Replicate each coefficient once. * Apply midpoint averaging to this new sequence n times.

Reference-contexts: Proving that the resulting limit surface is a C 1 manifold is fairly difficult. A reliable proof for quadrilateral method was only recently given in <ref> [Rei94] </ref>. We next derive a class of subdivision masks for extraordinary points that includes Loop's rule. We then sketch a proof that these rules produce a C 1 manifold in a neighborhood of the extraordinary point. <p> Therefore, the triangulation in A k must be 1 1. A similar argument applies to larger annuli. Small annuli can be checked by hand. 2 Checking whether the triangulation forms a 1 1 covering of the parameter plane is the equivalent of Reif's Jacobian condition in <ref> [Rei94] </ref>. We can now precisely characterize the final limit surface. Let L [n; p](t) be the piecewise linear function defined by the parameterization n = (x 1 ; x 2 ).

Reference-contexts: For this particular transformation, the vertices of the new polygon are placed 1 4 and 3 of the way between the old vertices. Applying this process repeatedly yields a polygon with a great number of segments that closely approximate a smooth curve. What is this smooth curve? Reisenfeld <ref> [Rie75] </ref> shows that the curve is a uniform quadratic B-spline whose control points are the original polygon. * Figure 1.3 depicts piecewise linear subdivision. Each triangular face is split into four subtriangles.

CONVERGENCE OF SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS 21 of the functions f j (t) do not necessarily converge to the derivative of their pointwise limit. <ref> [Tay55, Ch. 18] </ref> gives several good examples of this behavior (and is the source for much of the material in this subsection). The reason for this weakness is in the definition of pointwise convergence. Given an *, each value of t has a distinct k associated with it. <p> However, g j (t) g j (0) also converges to g (t) g (0). So, Z t h (s)ds + g (0) for any t. Thus, h (t) is the derivative of g (t). 2 This theorem is a slight variant of theorem IV on page 599 of <ref> [Tay55] </ref>.

The control points for this curve were computed from the original control points by applying . j (t) and h j (t) 50 CHAPTER 5.
