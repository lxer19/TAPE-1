Abstract: Chemically Amplified Resists (CARs) are much less observable than their i-line counterparts due to the absence of photoresist actinic absorbency. CARs however, exhibit resist thinning during the Post-Exposure Bake process (PEB). A Design of Experiments (DOE) technique was employed around the exposure and the PEB temperature for a commercial DUV photoresist. A Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) technique was used to measure the deprotection of the CARs after the PEB step while standard interferometry techniques were used for exposed area thickness loss measurements after the PEB step. Our analysis indicates that exposed area thickness loss is strongly correlated to the deprotection of the photoresist, so that thickness loss can serve as a reliable deprotection indicator and can hence be possibly used as an observable for control of the photolithography sequence.

Reference-contexts: In the quenching stage, the H+ ions are slowly quenched by anything more basic than the acid such as the additives and the by-products of the reaction. In short, the t-BOC blocked polymer undergoes acidolysis to generate the soluble hydroxyl group in the presence of acid and heat <ref> [1] </ref>. [FIGURE 1] The blocking group is such an effective inhibitor of dissolution that nearly every blocked site on the polymer must be deblocked in order to obtain significant dissolution. Thus the photoresist is usually made more sensitive by only partially blocking the resin.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, increasing the PEB temperature increases the amount of reaction between the H+ ions and the side chains and hence the deprotection. It has become common practice to employ Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) for off-line quantification of the photoacid-induced deprotection of positive chemically amplified photoresists <ref> [7] </ref>. 3. EXPERIMENT 3.1 Experimental Design The process inputs for this experiment were the exposure dose and the PEB temperature while the response variables were the amount of deprotection and the exposed area resist thickness loss.

In addition, the identification of easy to measure observables would allow the use of simple broadband reflectometry as an in-situ sensor rather than a FTIR tool which would be difficult to integrate into lithography equipment as an in-situ sensor.
