Title: Linguistic Relativity and Word Acquisition: A Computational Approach

Abstract: Language plays a pervasive role in our day-to-day experience and is likely to have an effect on other non-linguistic aspects of life. At the same time, language is itself constrained by the world. In this paper we study this interaction using Playpen, a connectionist model of the acquisition of word meaning. We argue that the interaction between linguistic and non-linguistic categories depends on the pattern of correlations in the world and on their relation to the correlations defined by words. We then discuss three kinds of possible interactions and present simulations of each using Playpen, a neural-network model of the acquisition of word meaning.

Reference-contexts: This is also consistent with findings that in Tzeltal, a Mayan language with an apparently complicated system for expressing spatial relations, context-specific spatial relation words are learned earlier than the more abstract spatial prepositions <ref> (Brown, 1994) </ref>. Experiment 2 Highlighting dimensions The goal of the second simulation is to verify that the networks trained on the Hard language do in fact pay more attention to the relevant than to the irrelevant dimension. To test this we presented the trained networks with novel perceptual input patterns.

Reference-contexts: The Model Playpen <ref> (Gasser & Colunga, 1997) </ref> is a connectionist model of the acquisition of word meaning. For the purposes of this paper, the following features of the model are relevant: 1. The network is a generalization of a continuous Hopfield network. Units are updated randomly until the network settles. 2.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a model must be able to learn relational correlations <ref> (Gasser & Colunga, 1998) </ref>. Third, the model can be run in both the comprehension and the production directions, allowing for the possibility of mutual effects of language and perception on one another.

Reference-contexts: Second, the model is designed to deal with relational knowledge. Languages vary more in the way in which they express relational information than in the way they ex-press information about objects, so it is more likely that effects of language will be found in relational words <ref> (Gentner & Boroditsky, 1998) </ref> While we do not model these properties of relation words, they argue for focusing on relation words as a possible site of relativistic effects, and modeling these effects would require a system capable of handling relations.

Reference-contexts: Because concrete nouns in most languages are organized mainly in terms of shape, this attentional bias helps them generalize correctly. The shape bias appears only after the child has learned roughly 50 nouns, most of them naming categories of things that are similar in shape <ref> (Jones et al., 1992) </ref>. This suggests that it is the learning of words that drives the learning of the bias. The way in which the linguistic categories correlate with perceptual dimensions apparently causes the learner to attend to particular dimensions, at least in the context of linguistic tasks.

Reference-contexts: Relation words take the form of MRUs. Each MOU has a single phase angle; each MRU has two phase angles, one for each of the objects it relates. 4. Connection weights are adjusted via the contrastive Heb bian learning rule <ref> (Movellan, 1990) </ref>. 5. Non-linguistic features and relation words interact through one or more intermediate layers of MRUs. Three characteristics of Playpen make it especially well suited to the study of the interaction between language and perception. First, linguistic meaning and non-linguistic concepts are not rigidly distinguished.

Reference-contexts: First, some words could be rendered easier to learn than others. In fact, some categories of words are consistently learned before others, an effect which cannot be explained by frequency. Across languages nouns are learned before verbs <ref> (Nelson, Hampson, & Shaw, 1993) </ref> and instrument verbs are learned before other verbs (Huttenlocher, Smiley, & Char may be associated with words, represented by squares, in such a way that the words agree with non-linguistic categories (squiggly pattern), disagree with non-linguistic categories (solid pattern), subdivide non-linguistic categories (cross-hatched pattern), or combine

Reference-contexts: Does language affect thought; that is, do linguistic categories influence general cognitive categories? More generally, how do linguistic and non-linguistic categories interact? The Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, associated most closely with Benjamin Lee Whorf <ref> (Whorf, 1956) </ref>, concerns the first question. The claim, in its strongest form, is that linguistic categories exert a direct influence on general cognitive categories.

Reference-contexts: It is by now clear that they learn a great deal about how the world works during this time (Baillargeon, 1994; Spelke, Breinlinger, Macomber, & Jacobson, 1992). One aspect of this learning is the discovery of correlations between features along different dimensions <ref> (Younger, 1990) </ref>. These nonlinguistic correlations define what we will call non-linguistic categories. In its second year, the child begins to learn language, which introduces its own categories, defined in terms of the correlations between words and non-linguistic dimensions. The linguistic categories may agree or disagree with the non-linguistic categories.
