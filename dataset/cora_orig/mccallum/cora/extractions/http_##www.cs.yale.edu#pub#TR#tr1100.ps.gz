Title: Mixing Times for Uniformly Ergodic Markov Chains  
Author: David Aldous and Laszlo Lovasz and Peter Winkler 
Keyword: Markov chain, stopping time, mixing time, minorization.  
Abstract: Consider the class of discrete time, general state space Markov chains which satisfy a "uniform ergodicity under sampling" condition. There are many ways to quantify the notion of "mixing time", that is time to approach stationarity from a worst initial state. We prove results asserting equivalence (up to universal constants) of different quantifications of mixing time. This work combines three areas of Markov theory which are rarely connected: the potential-theoretical characterization of optimal stopping times, the theory of stability and convergence to stationarity for general-state chains, and the theory surrounding mixing times for finite-state chains.

Reference-contexts: Theorems 1 and 3 reflect the spirit of Theorems B and C in dealing with inequalities. The orem A is in the spirit of standard results on maximal coupling and minimal strong stationary times (see section 6.2) giving "optimal constructions" or "min-max characterizations".
