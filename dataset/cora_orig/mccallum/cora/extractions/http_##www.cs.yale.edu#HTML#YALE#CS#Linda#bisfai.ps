Abstract: What's so great about connectionism? From the philosopher's point of view, one attribute stands out as particularly important, an attribute that is usually called "emergent schemata." We'll use the term "strong emergent schemata" to distinguish the real thing from a weaker version that might be advertised as emergent schemata but doesn't meet all the criteria that are philosophically significant. Philosopher Andy Clark [Cla89] is a representative but particularly clear-spoken advocate of the view that strong emergent schemata are important, and that achieving this behavior is connectionism's most impressive accomplishment. Our theses here are the following. (1) Clark, Paul Churchland and others are right that strong emergent schemata are crucial to intelligent behavior. But (2) strong emergent schemata have nothing whatsoever to do with connectionist or PDP approaches. They are exactly as attainable within symbol processing or "semantically transparent" systems as they are within connectionist systems. We will demonstrate that this is true by showing a symbolic AI program (the FGP machine) displaying exactly "strong emergent schemata" behavior.
