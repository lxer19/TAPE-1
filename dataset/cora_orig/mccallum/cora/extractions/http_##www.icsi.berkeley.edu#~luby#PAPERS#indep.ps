Title: Approximately Counting Up To Four (Extended Abstract)  
Author: Michael Luby Eric Vigoda 
Note: for some constant c &gt; 0.  
Abstract: We present a fully-polynomial scheme to approximate the number of independent sets in graphs with maximum degree four. In general, for graphs with maximum degree 4, the scheme approximates a weighted sum of independent sets. The weight of each independent set is expressed in terms of a positive parameter 1 3 , where the weight of independent set S is jSj . We also prove complementary hardness of approximation results, which show that it is hard to approximate the weighted sum for values of &gt; c

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The hard-core model in statistical physics is a simple representation of a gas as a graph G = (V; E) <ref> [2] </ref>. Vertices represent possible sites for the non-negligible sized particles and adjacent sites cannot simultaneously be occupied to prevent overlapping particles.

Reference-contexts: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first example where the general counting problem is provably easier than the corresponding optimization. Independently, Bubley and Dyer <ref> [3] </ref> have results on approximately counting independent sets. Their results are incomparable to ours. 2 Machinery Before getting in to the proof, we need to overview some background material and machinery.

Reference-contexts: The transitions of the chain are based on edges of the input graph. We use a coupling argument to show rapid mixing. Recently, there have been several successful uses of coupling to show rapid mixing of Markov chains, e.g., see <ref> [4] </ref>, [7], and [12]. There were no efficient methods for computing the partition function for any class of graphs including those of most interest to physicists such as the Cartesian lattice.

Reference-contexts: Dobrushin <ref> [5] </ref> showed that such a measure is not unique for above a critical threshold. This critical threshold is not known for most graphs, even the Cartesian lattice, and there are few rigorous bounds. It is quite conceivable that rapid mixing occurs iff is below the critical threshold.

Our proof follows that of <ref> [14, Theorem 1.17] </ref>. Consider a graph G with maximum degree four for which we can not approximate the size of the maximum independent set within a factor of 1 + *, * &gt; 0. <p> Notice that if we want to optimize the constant we simply need the ratio of Z L to Z S to be 1=poly (n). Unless RP = N P , this implies there is no f pras for computing the partition function. It is shown in <ref> [14] </ref> that an algorithm which approximates Z within a polynomial factor can be boosted to obtain a f pras for Z. 7 Remarks Consider when the graph G is infinite.
