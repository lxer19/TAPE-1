Reference-contexts: We'll start with the general definition of B-splines, then specify how to make uniformly spaced, endpoint-interpolating B-splines from these. (More detailed derivations of these and other splines appear in a number of standard texts <ref> [1, 7] </ref>.) Given positive integers d and k, with k d, and a collection of non-decreasing values x 0 , : : : , x k+d+1 called knots, the nonuniform B-spline basis functions of degree d are defined recursively as follows. <p> = 1, : : : , d, let 0 ae 0 otherwise N i (x) := x i+r x i r1 x i+r+1 x N i+1 (x). (Note: The fractions in these equations are taken to be 0 when their denominators are 0.) The endpoint-interpolating B-splines of degree d on <ref> [0, 1] </ref> result when the first and last d + 1 knots are set to 0 and 1, respectively.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we develop a mathematical framework known as multires-olution analysis for studying wavelets <ref> [2, 11] </ref>. Our examples will continue to focus on the Haar basis, but the more general mathematical notation used here will come in handy for discussing other wavelet bases in later sections. Multiresolution analysis relies on many results from linear algebra.

Reference-contexts: There are a variety of ways to construct wavelets with k continuous derivatives. One such class of wavelets can be constructed from piecewise-polynomial splines.

The Haar basis is in fact the simplest instance of spline wavelets, resulting when the polynomial degree is set to zero. In the following, we briefly sketch the ideas behind the construc tion of endpoint-interpolating B-spline wavelets.

Either the standard construction or the nonstandard construction described in Part 1 for Haar basis functions can be used to form a two-dimensional basis from a one-dimensional B-spline basis.
