Abstract: The star graph S n is a graph with S n the set of all permutations over f1; : : :; ng as its vertex set; two vertices 1 and 2 are connected if 1 can be obtained form 2 by swapping the first element of 1 with one of the other n 1 elements. In this paper we establish the genus of the star graph. We show that the genus, g n of S n , is exactly equal to n!(n 4)=6 + 1 by establishing a lower bound and inductively giving a drawing on a surface of appropriate genus.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [1] </ref> Akers, Harel and Krishnamurthy introduced the star graph as a computational network for parallel computing. It was also shown that the star graph has many properties which are desirable for practical networks; such as low diameter, low degree, symmetry and low fault diameter. <p> They also designed efficient routing algorithms on the star graph. Since then some work has been done to design efficient parallel algorithms for the star graph [6]. In this paper we are concerned with the genus of this graph. Akers, Harel and Krishnamurthy <ref> [1, 2] </ref> conjectured that the genus of the star graph is n 3.

We want to study Cayley graphs of familiar groups. Therefore, S n the group of permutations of f1; : : : ; ng is a natural choice.

Reference-contexts: The genus of a graph may be considered as a measure of non-planarity. Hence if we can draw a graph on a plane without any edge crossings then its genus is 0. Graphs with high genus are "extremely non-planar." For more formal treatment of this subject see <ref> [3, 4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this section our goal is to prove the following theorem: Theorem 3.1 For n 3, the genus of the star graph S n is given by, g n = 6 Our method is based on that of Beineke and Harary <ref> [5] </ref>, who computed the genus of the n-cube. To show the above result we first establish a lower bound for g n which follows from the Euler characteristic formula.
