Abstract: Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as a "working draft" or "work in progress." Abstract This memorandum describes a protocol called RTP suitable for the end-to-end network transport of real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data for both multicast and unicast transport services. The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) designed to provide minimal control and identification functionality particularly in multicast networks. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and bridges. Within multicast associations, sites can direct control messages to individual sites. The protocol does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of-service for real-time services.

Reference-contexts: A single packet of the underlying protocol may contain several RTP packets if permitted by the encapsulation method. A (protocol) port is the "abstraction that transport protocols use to distinguish among multiple destinations within a given host computer. TCP/IP protocols identify ports using small positive integers." <ref> [1] </ref> The transport selectors (TSEL) used by the OSI transport layer are equivalent to ports. A transport address denotes the combination of network address, e.g., the 4-octet IP Version 4 address, and the transport protocol port, e.g., the UDP port. <p> Schulzrinne/S.

Reference-contexts: Several consecutive RTP packets may have equal timestamps if they are generated at once. The timestamp consists of the middle 32 bits of a 64-bit NTP timestamp, as defined in RFC 1305 <ref> [5] </ref>. That is, it counts time since 0 hours UTC, January 1, 1900, with a resolution of 65536 ticks per second. (UTC is Coordinated Universal Time, approximately equal to the historical Greenwich Mean Time.) The RTP timestamp wraps around approximately every 18 hours.

Reference-contexts: In most cases, it will be obvious to the person receiving the data if he or she does not possess the right encryption key. 4 For a description of certificates see, for example, RFC 1422 or <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Schulzrinne/S. Casner Expires 11/01/93 [Page 17] INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-avt-rtp-03.ps September 15, 1993 source-specific keys offer no advantage. The descriptor value zero is reserved for a default mode using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm in CBC (cipher block chaining) mode, as described in Section 1.1 of RFC 1423 <ref> [7] </ref>. The padding specified in that section is to be used. The 8-octet initialization vector (IV) may be carried unencrypted within the ENC option, generated anew for each packet.

Reference-contexts: (indicated by an option length of one), the fixed RTP header is used as the initalization vector. (Using the fixed RTP header as the initialization vector avoids regenerating the initialization vector for each packet and incurs less header overhead.) For details on the tradeoffs for CBC initialization vector use, see <ref> [8] </ref>. Support for encryption is not required. Implementations that do not support encryption should recognize the ENC option so that they can avoid processing encrypted messages and provide a meaningful failure indication.

Reference-contexts: Carrying several RTP packets in one network or transport packet reduces header overhead and may simplify synchronization between different streams. 8.2 ST-II When used in conjunction with RTP, ST-II <ref> [11] </ref> service access ports (SAPs) have a length of 16 bits. The next protocol field ("NextPCol", Section 4.2.2.10 in RFC 1190) is used to distinguish two encapsulations of RTP over ST-II. The first uses NextPCol value TBD and directly places the RTP packet into the ST-II data area.
