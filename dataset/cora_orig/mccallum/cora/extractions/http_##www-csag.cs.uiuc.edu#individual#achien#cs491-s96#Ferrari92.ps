Title: REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION IN AN INTERNETWORK

Abstract: Can end-to-end communication performance be guaranteed by a packet-switching internetwork? This paper addresses the question by examining the feasibility of extending to an internetwork the Tenet approach to real-time communication service design. The conditions to be satisfied by an internetwork so that the approach can be extended to it are investigated. These include conditions for the scheduling discipline to be used in the nodes of the internetwork. The original Tenet approach to real-time communication applies to a network consisting of hosts, homogeneous nodes (or switches), and physical links connecting nodes and hosts in an arbitrary topology. The nodes are store-and-forward, and are scheduled by a multi-class version of the Earliest Due Date deadline-based policy. The discussion presented in this paper results in extendibility conditions that are quite broad; hence, the Tenet approach may be used to establish and run real-time channels in a vast class of internetworks. A case study is also discussed, involving a simple network, whose nodes are scheduled by FCFS-based disciplines, and the connection of such a network to an internetwork with deadline-based and hierarchical round robin scheduling. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Cooperative Agreement NCR-8919038 with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Hi-tachi, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., Pacific Bell, the University of California under a MICRO grant, and the International Computer Science Institute.

Reference-contexts: Since the ATM switches are scheduled by the Hierarchical Round-Robin discipline [KaKK90], the delay on the ATM backbone is bounded, and such a bound can be computed <ref> [BaKe92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, for a bounded-jitter channel, jitter must obviously be controlled; hence, the end-to-end bound J max is not subdivided, but, in a simple network, is only compared to the jitter introduced by the last node (node N) [VeZF91] <ref> [Ferr91] </ref>. The two probability bounds Z min and W min cannot be decomposed into sums of per-node terms. <p> If the delay bounds are deterministic, and clocks can be kept in synchrony, that is, if any differences between simultaneous readings of the clocks are known and do not vary appreciably during the lifetime of a packet in the network, jitters can also be bounded deterministically <ref> [Ferr91] </ref> [Part91]. <p> More complex logical links may have variable delays: if we consider the upper bounds of the delays in the decomposition of D max , we introduce additional jitter in the corresponding segments. This can be compensated for by a suitable jitter control mechanism (see for example <ref> [Ferr91] </ref>). If jitter control is not implemented, then the client-specified jitter bound must be decomposed in the same way as the end-to-end delay bound. <p> policy certainly influences the amount of buffer space a channel needs in a node for guaranteeing a given loss probability bound, but the necessary amount of space can be computed from the values of the local delay bound and of the maximum jitter at the input to the node [FeVe90b] <ref> [Ferr91] </ref>. Thus, as long as we can compute these values for a given scheduling policy, we can ignore loss probabilities in our discussion. <p> In a hierarchical internetwork, this number is given by R J x min d max,m + j in,m hhhhhhhhhhhh H J where the node being considered is the m-th on the channel's route, and j in,m is the maximum jitter for the channel's packets at the input to that node <ref> [Ferr91] </ref>. <p> An improvement can be obtained by using a distributed jitter control scheme such as the one described in <ref> [Ferr91] </ref>, which, under the same assumptions on which (10) is based, reduces the maximum jitter at the input to node m to Expression (9) is still valid, as long as the value of j in,m in it is replaced by that of j in,m given by (14).

Reference-contexts: Simple tests for the traffic characterization described in Section 2 and for a node obeying either of the models shown in Figure 2, and scheduled by Multi-Class EDD, can be found in <ref> [FeVe90a] </ref>, [FeVe90b], and [VeZF91]. The tests, if successful, are accompanied by computations, some of whose results are transmitted to the destination of the channel. <p> The Multi-Class EDD discipline satisfies Conditions (3) and (4)a, as well as (2)b; when coupled with an admission control scheme (Condition (1)) like the one described in <ref> [FeVe90a] </ref>, it can be used to build a real-time service. There are, however, many other policies that satisfy the above conditions.
