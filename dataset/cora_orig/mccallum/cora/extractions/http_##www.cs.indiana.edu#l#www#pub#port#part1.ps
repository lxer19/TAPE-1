Abstract: We have discovered that if English speakers are asked to repeat a phrase or short text containing two or more stressed syllables over and over, they tend to adjust the timing such that important syllable onsets (eg, stressed syllables) occur at times that are harmonic fractions of each other that is, the inter-event time intervals have a strong tendency to exhibit simple ratios close to 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, etc. This behavior is robust and easily obtained although there appear to be major differences between languages in how this timing is arranged. We demonstrate the basic effect in English and in Japanese and explore a little about the conditions under which the effect occurs in English. The harmonic timing effect is so strong, it may prove to be manipulable in ways that will be useful for research on issues like phonetic time measurement, the study of stress, typological differences between languages and possibly other matters.

Reference-contexts: Of more interest, however, is the relationship of this regularity to rhythm. Are these global constraints on stress timing a direct manifestation of rhythm in speech production? The observed constraints share many features with rhythmic patterns measured during cyclic activity of the limbs in walking, tapping and waving <ref> (Cummins and Port, 1996) </ref>. Among the characteristics of rhythmic organization are entrainment among constituents, as evidenced by stable, simple phase relations (Kelso, 1995). In our speech data, we found strong preferences for the medial syllable to be placed at roughly 1 3 ; 1 3 of the overall repetition cycle.

Reference-contexts: This should be in approximate correspondence with the time point in the syllable which a subject would use for aligning one syllable with respect to another stimulus, and thus be close to the syllable's "P-center". Based in part on Scott's model for P-center location <ref> (Scott, 1993) </ref>, and Marcus' original model (Marcus, 1981), we used the following algorithmic definition of a syllable's acoustic `beat:' After recording the speech at 8000 samples per second directly onto disk, it was passed through a simple auditory filtering model using the Lutear software package.

Reference-contexts: The tendency of produced phases to closely resemble those of the preceding trials is further evidence of an underlying system of coupled oscillatory processes. Both empirical observation of coupled processes (Buchanan and Kelso, 1993; Diedrich and Warren, 1995) and mathematical models of coupled oscillators <ref> (Thompson and Stewart, 1986) </ref> show that systems which have found a stable coupling relationship will persevere in that coupling mode in the face of external perturbation (here, the changing target phase).

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, there is evidence for the claim that interstress intervals in English are governed in part by global constraints. For example, Williams and Hiller <ref> (Williams and Hiller, 1994) </ref> found that the "foot compression effect" and a foot-dependent syllable shortening effect were nonrandom property of metrical feet, as opposed to random groups of syllables. They conclude that "it is indeed worth attempting to measure rhythmicality, as this has been shown not to be random" (p.438).
