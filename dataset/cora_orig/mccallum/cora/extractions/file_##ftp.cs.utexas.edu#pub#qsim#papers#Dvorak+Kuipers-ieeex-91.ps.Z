Reference-contexts: Mimic focuses primarily on determining the state of the physical system, but most of these expert systems have the broader scope of trying to advise the operator on corrective actions. Escort <ref> [2] </ref>, an exemplar of this group, gets its knowledge of faults and anomalies and corrective actions through the usual process of codifying human expertise in rules; Escort does not encode a predictive model of the physical system as Mimic does.

Reference-contexts: that we share: "dynamic process behavior yields considerably more information on process faults than can be achieved in the static case." A number of expert systems have been built which share the same operational goal as Mimic | that of relieving some of the burden of monitoring from process operators <ref> [4] </ref>. Mimic focuses primarily on determining the state of the physical system, but most of these expert systems have the broader scope of trying to advise the operator on corrective actions.

Reference-contexts: For each remaining suspect, each of its other operating modes is tested for compatibility with the observations. Whatever model variations survive this test are added to the tracking set. For a more detailed description of model-based diagnosis, see <ref> [8] </ref>. Unlike many diagnostic methods, model-based diagnosis does not rely on a set of symptom-fault patterns. The problem with relying on such patterns is that they are often incomplete since it is difficult for an expert to anticipate all possible faults and their symptoms, especially the symptoms of interacting faults.

Reference-contexts: Such information can be used to refute some hypotheses, which Mimic can do because the semi-quantitative model that it uses during tracking pro 18 vides such information. Isermann's model-based approach to process fault diagnosis <ref> [9] </ref>, like Mimic, uses dynamic mathematical models and measurable input and output signals to allow estimation of unmeasurable internal quantities, which can then be used for fault detection.

Reference-contexts: Semi-quantitative simulation provides this capability. Furthermore, when the observations match the predictions of two (or more) distinct behaviors, we want to track both hypotheses until they 7 diverge, which Mimic does. Qualitative simulation <ref> [14] </ref>, the foundation for semi-quantitative simulation, has two important characteristics for our application. First, it uses a qualitative level of description that permits imprecise knowledge to be expressed. This purely qualitative description uses no numbers (but can take advantage of quantitative information when available, as we shall soon see).

Reference-contexts: Second, qualitative simulation generates all of the qualitatively distinct behaviors attainable from a starting state, consistent with the given imprecise knowledge. This property is essential in monitoring a physical system, whether healthy or faulty. Quantitative refinement of qualitative simulation <ref> [15] </ref> takes advantage of quantitative knowledge when it is available, which is always the case in process plants.

Reference-contexts: A behavior is a path through the directed graph and consists of a sequence of states alternating between states that represent an instant of time and states that represent an interval of time. Tracking, also called measurement interpretation <ref> [16, 17] </ref>, is the process of using the observations to follow a path (a behavior) through the behavior graph.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the simulation, just like the physical system, is made to react to changes in independent variables. * Through progressive step-size refinement of the semi-quantitative simulation, a desired precision can be attained for the quantitative predictions <ref> [18] </ref>. Specifically, the time interval between qualitative time points can be used to refine the step-size of the quantitative simulation, inserting new quantitative states having time points within that interval. <p> Similarly, the effects of proposed control actions can be determined by simulating from the current state. The three technologies that Mimic builds upon continue to be active areas of research, and Mimic stands to inherit the benefits of this research. For example, recent research by Berleant and Kuipers <ref> [18] </ref> and Kay and Kuipers [27] have improved quantitative reasoning mechanisms to provider 20 tighter bounds on predictions of semi-quantitative models. Also, research by Fouche and Kuipers [23] on reasoning about energy has eliminated an important source of spurious behaviors in qualitative simulation.

Reference-contexts: However, before the model is discarded, an attempt is made to modify it to bring its predictions into agreement with the observations. This is similar in intent to the Debug phase of the Generate-Test-Debug (GTD) paradigm <ref> [19] </ref>, though GTD and Mimic differ in many other ways. Using the structural model (the model of components, connections, and parameters), the algorithm traces upstream from the site of the discrepancies to identify all components and parameters that could have contributed to the discrepancy (dependency tracing).

Reference-contexts: Even if the symptom-fault patterns are collected from exhaustive fault-model simulations, it is not necessarily more efficient to use 11 such patterns, as Davis has argued <ref> [20] </ref>. Another important property of model-based diagnosis is that it handles failed sensors and missing data in a natural way, not as a special case. A sensor is just another component that affects an observation; dependency tracing will identify it as a suspect in the usual way.

Reference-contexts: Another important property of model-based diagnosis is that it handles failed sensors and missing data in a natural way, not as a special case. A sensor is just another component that affects an observation; dependency tracing will identify it as a suspect in the usual way. As Scarl <ref> [21] </ref> observes, model-based reasoning avoids combinatoric problems in handling failed sensors and unavailable data because it matches against predictions rather than symptomatic patterns. If a sensor is bad and thus gives readings different than predicted, the sensor becomes a suspect simply because it is upstream of the discrepancy.

Reference-contexts: However, this problem has been substantially reduced in qualitative simulation by the introduction of several global constraints | constraints that eliminate spurious behaviors through global consistency checks, such as the non-intersection constraint applied to 17 trajectories in qualitative phase space <ref> [22] </ref>, the automatic derivation of en-ergy constraints by recognizing conservative and non-conservative forces [23], and the use of higher-order derivative constraints [24]. The Qsim algorithm guarantees that all behaviors are predicted, and only under a qualitative level of description does this give a tractable set of possibilities.

Reference-contexts: In simple cases (such as the water heater) this is tractable in practice as well as in theory. For more complex systems, controlling the size of the hypothesis set is still a potential problem. 5 Related Work Kay <ref> [25] </ref> has demonstrated the Mimic approach in monitoring the pump-down phase of a vacuum system for semiconductor fabrication, where ultra-high vacuums are required (10 9 Torr). Since there is no practical theory for the sorption of gases, it is difficult to model the process numerically.

Reference-contexts: Kay's semi-quantitative model, with dynamic envelopes that bounded the expected observations, permitted reasoning with uncertainties and still achieved detection of faults early in the pump-down phase. Abbott's approach to monitoring and diagnosis <ref> [32] </ref>, like sc Mimic, takes advantage of the sequence in which symptoms appear, although the mechanisms are somewhat different. Draphys detects symptoms (discrepancies) by comparing sensor readings to expected values computed from a numerical simulation model of the fault-free system.
