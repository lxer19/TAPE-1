Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 (Chinese Remainder Theorem, version 1, Theorem 5.5.2 in <ref> [1] </ref>) Let m 1 ; m 2 ; : : :; m k be positive integers that are pairwise relatively prime. Let m = m 1 m 2 m k . <p> fl Note that the subscripted 3 above indicates that we are looking for the coefficient 7 fl of f i found by running the extended Euclidean algorithm. 8 e i f i f 1 9 x x + (e i a i ) 10 return x Corollary 2 (5.5.3 in <ref> [1] </ref>) Assume that all m i &gt; 1 and that all m i are pairwise relatively prime. Then we can find a solution in O ((lg m) 2 ) bit operations. Sketch of proof: Based on the assumptions, we know that k = O (lg m). <p> + log 2 i=1 !! = O ((lg m) 2 ): Similarly, we can prove the bit complexity of the other steps in the algorithm are O ((lg m) 2 ). 2.3 The Algebraic Form of the Chinese Remainder Theorem Theorem 3 (Chinese Remainder Theorem, version 2, Theorem 5.5.4 in <ref> [1] </ref>) Let m 1 ; m 2 ; : : :; m k be positive integers that are pairwise relatively prime.
