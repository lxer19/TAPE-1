Abstract: The Tenet Scheme specifies a real-time communication service that guarantees performance through network connections with reserved resources, admission control, and rate control. Within this framework, we develop and evaluate algorithms that find routes for these multicast connections. The main goals are to maximize the probability of successful establishment of the routed connection, to maximize the useful utilization of the network, and to be timely. The primary problem to be solved is finding a minimum cost tree where each source to destination path is constrained by a delay bound. This problem is NP-complete, so heuristics based mainly on minimum incremental cost are developed. Algorithms we develop use those heuristics to calculate minimum cost paths that are then merged into a tree. We evaluate our design decisions through simulation, measuring success through the number of successfully established connections. These experiments demonstrate that our evaluation methodology is a useful tool for the development of robust routing algorithms for real-time channels.

Reference-contexts: Other protocols for network QoS guarantees either do not address routing, or they make a simple attempt at routing. The ST-II protocol builds a multicast distribution tree from unicast routing tables, while RSVP relies on the underlying network for routes [MiESZ93]. The Session Reservation Protocol (SRP) <ref> [DiGen93] </ref> makes resource reservation on the Internet, but relies on IP routing to provide its route. 8.0 Conclusions In this project, we set out to learn how to develop a routing algorithm in a real-time multicast connection-oriented environment, specifically the Tenet Scheme 2 from the University of California at Berkeley.

Reference-contexts: Rounding a 10 msec propagation delay up to 1 msec is not a problem with one or two hops, but, with 50 hops, a 500 msec actual end-to-end propagation delay is modeled as a 50 msec delay, which increases the chance for the path to be artificially rejected. <ref> [DoaLes93] </ref> has looked into strategies for adding new members to heuristically derived (unconstrained) Steiner Trees.

Reference-contexts: 1.0 Introduction The growing speed of wide-area networks has spawned much interest in new kinds of communication-based applications, which require more predictable performance from the network. The Tenet Group at the University of California has been addressing the problem of providing a communication service with real-time guarantees <ref> [FeBaZh92] </ref>. The initial design, known as Scheme 1, provides a communication abstraction called a real-time channel, which is a simplex unicast end-to-end connection with performance guarantees and restrictions on traffic.

Reference-contexts: A client may request the establishment of a simplex multicast channel, which has a single source and an arbitrary number of destinations. The client must characterize the data traffic that will ow through this channel throughout its lifetime using the following parameters <ref> [Fer90] </ref>: X min - the minimum packet inter-arrival time X ave - the worst-case average packet inter-arrival time 1. The design of Scheme 2 is work-in-progress, so we did not address features that are not yet mature.

Reference-contexts: We will need to make compromises to reduce the running time of the algorithms in the face of the growing scale of network communication. We need to support upcoming Scheme 2 features such as sharing relationships between channels and routing within a partition of resources. <ref> [FerGup93] </ref> 35 We need to look at real-life network configurations to ensure that we are not over-engineering a solution. Simple networks may only require simple solutions.

For each destination, add it to a cluster if it is within distance internode_distance of another cluster member and if it doesnt make the cluster width larger than cluster_width.

Reference-contexts: Currently under development is Scheme 2, the next generation of algorithms which will add support for multi-party communication and for a more flexible client-service interface <ref> [Hef94] </ref>. To this end, the real-time channel abstraction has been redefined as a multicast (one-to-many) connection. A basic requirement for the establishment of real-time channels is a route between the source and destination (s).

Reference-contexts: The timeliness of the channel establishment phase is important to us (especially its scalability), but it is beyond the scope of this study. 11.

Reference-contexts: Kompella <ref> [Komp93] </ref> has defined the problem of finding a minimum cost tree under the end-to-end delay constraints the Constrained Steiner Tree (CST) problem, and he has proven it to be NP-complete as well. <p> The example in Figure 3 shows how, even in the simplest of networks, the union of two constrained paths 18 can result in an improper tree. One solution would be to run a minimum delay spanning tree algorithm on the union of the complete set of paths <ref> [Komp93] </ref>, which would have running times of around O (E lg E) or O (E lg V) [CoLeRi90]. Our approach is to make locally optimal decisions that keep costs down, but with the added expense of detecting and breaking deadlocks. <p> One semantic clarification we must make is with the meaning of successful establishment. The Tenet Scheme allows for partial success in channel establishment, meaning that not necessarily all destinations 9. The CST problem is intractable but not impossible. The solution requires a systematic enumeration of spanning trees <ref> [Komp93] </ref>, giving it an exponential running time; nonetheless, it certainly is solvable. 22 have to be included in the 1 by N multicast channel for the channel to be considered active. <p> We expect the planned research in hierarchical routing to deal with this issue. 7.0 Related Work Very little work has been done in the area of multicast routing for connection-oriented networks with performance constraints. The most relevant work to date is by Kompella <ref> [Komp93] </ref>, whose CMCT algorithm treats delay strictly as a constraint, a position we agree with. The algorithm creates a closure graph of collapsed minimum cost constrained routes between the source and every destination, on which it constructs a minimum spanning tree (again subject to constraints).

Reference-contexts: The computation is centralized at the source of the channel, at one of the destinations, or even a third-party node. There are several advantages to source routing <ref> [Moran93] </ref>: 1. It is easier to control construction of the tree. One of the primary functions of the routing algorithm is to constrain the end-to-end delay of the paths. <p> To remedy these anomalous situations, we can try a greedy approach to ordering. With the Adaptive Ordering heuristic <ref> [Moran93] </ref>, we select the next destination based on the absolute minimum incremental cost we can achieve. <p> In addition, the unconstrained algorithms rely on the well known Floyd-Warshall Shortest Paths algorithm. We knew of no constrained single source shortest-path algorithms, so we developed one based on the well known Bellman-Ford algorithm.[CoLeRi90] 5.2.1 Constrained Bellman-Ford The Constrained Bellman-Ford (CBF) <ref> [Moran93] </ref> algorithm finds independent minimum cost paths between a source and a set of destination nodes subject to each destinations delay constraint. That is, the path will have the lowest cost possible without violating the delay constraint. <p> Similarly, for the probability of future establishments, we could repeatedly interrupt a set sequence of establishments with a single random establishment, and then measure how long it takes to reach saturation <ref> [Moran93] </ref>. One semantic clarification we must make is with the meaning of successful establishment. The Tenet Scheme allows for partial success in channel establishment, meaning that not necessarily all destinations 9. The CST problem is intractable but not impossible.

Reference-contexts: The DCM Routing Algorithm [ParFer93] is a unicast algorithm for the Tenet Scheme 1. It solves the problem of finding constrained routes using a constrained version of the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm. 34 Because the algorithm is based on the Rate-Controlled Static Priority scheduling discipline <ref> [ZhaFer92] </ref>, and because it only calculates minimum hop paths, it cannot be extended for our purposes. Other protocols for network QoS guarantees either do not address routing, or they make a simple attempt at routing.
