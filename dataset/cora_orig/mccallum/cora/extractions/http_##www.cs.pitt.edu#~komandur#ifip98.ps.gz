Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction & Motivation Multicast service is an important aspect of any routing architecture. An important role of multi-cast service is to provide group abstraction <ref> [1] </ref>. ISPs and major carriers are building the necessary infrastructure to support multicast and service differentiation capabilities. The popularity of applications that need multicast service is evident in the success of the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBONE)[2]. There are two main approaches to multicasting.

Reference-contexts: The choice of multicast tree affects almost all of the above metrics. Recent studies suggest that shared trees (STs) are very scalable in terms of bandwidth consumption, network resources, join latency, membership management complexity and operating system overhead <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>. The importance of STs and increasing deployment of ATM in WANs makes it imperative that we support multipoint-to-multipoint (mp-mp)[5, 6, 7] connections efficiently and scalably in ATM networks. The Public Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI)[8] is a hierarchical routing protocol designed to scale efficiently to large networks.

Reference-contexts: The Public Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI)[8] is a hierarchical routing protocol designed to scale efficiently to large networks. While PNNI specifies point-to-point routing, multicast routing has been left unspecified. The work in <ref> [9] </ref> provides signaling support for the point-to-multipoint (p-mp) connection but mp-mp routing in ATM networks has not yet been studied in depth. This paper tackles this problem. <p> This facilitates efficient/speedy implementations. Group Join: Assuming a multicast group address is known, when a host intends to join the mp-mp call, there are two options available. It can directly send the Leaf-Initiated Join (LIJ <ref> [9] </ref>) request to the PGL, which in turn forwards it to the DS, or obtain the DS address from the PGL and send the join request directly to the DS. The DS uses its view to establish a path to the new member based on QoS or policy constraints.

Reference-contexts: It is used to lessen the router state required for the current Internet, fl This work was performed when the author was at the Computer Science Department, University of Pittsburgh. but it inherently suffers from the same scaling limitations as DVMRP. There was an attempt to extend Doar's <ref> [14] </ref> p-mp work on naive multicast in Hierarchical PIM (HPIM)[15]. HPIM primarily addresses the problems associated with the Rendezvous-point (RP) of PIM, but its performance is yet to be evaluated. The above protocols take a soft state approach, in which the unicast routing determines the current multicast routing.

Reference-contexts: As discussed above, we deal with this as two different issues: where to send the join request and where to join the new member. We assume that the multicast group address can be obtained (perhaps through a hierarchical version of Session Directory <ref> [24] </ref>) and that the DS address is obtained through interaction with PGL. When a join request is received at an on-tree switch, then the switch simply forwards the request towards the DS.
