Abstract: Image intensity variations can result from several different object surface effects, including shading from 3-dimensional relief of the object, or paint on the surface itself. An essential problem in vision, which people solve naturally, is to attribute the proper physical cause, e.g. surface relief or paint, to an observed image. We addressed this problem with an approach combining psychophysical and Bayesian computational methods. We assessed human performance on a set of test images, and found that people made fairly consistent judgements of surface properties. Our computational model assigned simple prior probabilities to different relief or paint explanations for an image, and solved for the most probable interpretation in a Bayesian framework. The ratings of the test images by our algorithm compared surprisingly well with the mean ratings of our subjects.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction When people study a picture, they can judge whether it depicts a shaded, 3-dimensional surface, or simply a flat surface with markings or paint on it. The two images shown in Figure 1 illustrate this distinction <ref> [1] </ref>. To many observers re-arrangement of the local features of 1a, yet it does not give an impression of shape or depth. There is no simple correct answer for this problem; either of these images could be explained as marks on paper, or as illuminated shapes.

Reference-contexts: Each of our 18 naive observers was given a 4 page survey showing the images in a different random order. To explain the problem of image interpretation quickly to naive subjects, we used a concrete story (Adelson's Theater Set Shop analogy <ref> [2] </ref> is a related didactic example). The survey instructions were as follows: Pretend that each of the following pictures is a photograph of work made by either a painter or a sculptor.

Reference-contexts: We noted that many of the shapes inferred from paint-like images showed long ridges coincidently aligned with the assumed light direction. The assumption of generic light direction can be applied in a Bayesian framework <ref> [3] </ref> to penalize such coincidental alignments.

Reference-contexts: A machine that could interpret images as people do would have many applications, such as the interactive editing and manipulation of images. Finally, there is a large body of computer vision work on "shape from shading"-inferring the 3-dimensional shape of a shaded object <ref> [4] </ref>. Virtually every algorithm assumes that all image intensity changes are caused by shading; these algorithms fail for any image with reflectance changes. To bring this body of work into practical use, we need to be able to disambiguate shading from reflectance changes.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to modeling the human judgements is Bayesian. We begin by formulating prior probabilities for shapes and reflectance images, in the spirit of recent work on the statistical modeling of images <ref> [5, 8, 11] </ref>. Using these priors, the algorithm then determines whether an image is more likely to have been generated by a 3D shape or as a pattern of reflectance. <p> To find the most probable interpretation, given an image, we need to assign prior probabilities to shape and reflectance configurations. There has been recent interest in characterizing the probabilities of images by the expected distributions of subband coefficient values <ref> [5, 8, 11] </ref>. The statistical distribution of bandpass linear filter outputs, for natural images, is highly kurtotic; the output is usually small, but in rare cases it takes on very large values. This non-gaussian behavior is not a property of the filter operation, because filtered "random" images appear gaussian.

Reference-contexts: For our computational experiments we seek a rendering model for shapes which simplifies the mathematics, yet maintains the essential ambiguities of the problem. We use the ap proximations of linear shading <ref> [6] </ref>. This involves two sets of approximations. <p> Despite this simplicity, images rendered under linear shading appear fairly realistically shaded <ref> [6] </ref>. 3 Psychophysics We used a survey to assess subjects' image judgements. We made a set of 60 test images, using Canvas and Photoshop programs to generate and manipulate the images. Our goal was to create a set of images with varying degrees of shadedness.

Reference-contexts: rating scale to indicate whether each image was made by the painter (P) or sculptor (S): S, S?, ?, P?, P. 3.1 Survey Results We examined a non-parametric comparison of the image ratings, the rank order correlation (the linear correlation of image rankings in order of shapeness by each observer) <ref> [7] </ref>. Over all possible pairings of subjects, the rank order correlations ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, averaging 0.65. All of these correlations were statistically significant, most at the 0.0001 level.

Reference-contexts: To bring this body of work into practical use, we need to be able to disambiguate shading from reflectance changes. There has been very little work on this problem. Sinha and Adelson <ref> [9] </ref> examined a world of painted polyhedra, and used consistancy constraints to identify regions of shape and reflectance changes. Their consistancy constraints involved specific assumptions which need not always hold and may be better described in a probabilistic framework. In addition, we seek a solution for more general, greyscale images.
