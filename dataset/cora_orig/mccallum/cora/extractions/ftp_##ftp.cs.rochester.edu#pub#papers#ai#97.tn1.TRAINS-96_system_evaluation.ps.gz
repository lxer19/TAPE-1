Title: TRAINS-96 System Evaluation cooperatively solve a given problem. Success is measured in terms of task
Author: Amanda J. Stent and James F. Allen 
Note: The evaluation uses the same task-based methodology as was used for the TRAINS-95 evaluation [7], in which the user and computer  1

Abstract: In this report we describe an experiment designed to: * evaluate the performance of the TRAINS-96 system as a whole * examine the utility of a new robust post-parser module, recently added to the TRAINS system * explore the benefit to the user of receiving system feedback on speech input

Reference-contexts: For example, "I want to go to Chicago" is parsed as having speech-act type tell. The post-parser changes this to id-goal. The post-parser currently has about 80 verb templates, corresponding to the verb types in <ref> [1] </ref>. Only a very small fraction of these have actually been used and tested, because very few verbs are needed in the current version of the TRAINS system. <p> 2 32 Suggestions for the TRAINS system Subject Suggestions 3 [6] The train was not allowed to change plans and if you tried one route and then switched it, it would try and use that path and the new one, so it went out of its way a lot. 4 <ref> [1] </ref> Couldn't get the trains to go back to the cities they came from to try a different path.
