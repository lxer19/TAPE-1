Abstract: A significant collection of two-point boundary value problems is shown to give rise to linear systems of algebraic equations on which Gaussian elimination with row partial pivoting is unstable when standard solution techniques are used.

Reference-contexts: Higham and Higham <ref> [2] </ref> present a number of dense matrices that arise naturally in applications for which the growth factors are between n=2 and n when both partial and complete pivoting are used. They point out that large growth factors do not necessarily imply large backward errors in the computed solution.

Reference-contexts: We conclude that for multiple-shooting coefficient matrices arising from (13), the observed growth factor during Gaussian elimination may be as large as approximately 2 N+1 . 4. Discussion. In <ref> [7] </ref>, Trefethen writes with reference to real k fi k matrices: "Perhaps large growth rates like 2 k1 correspond to unstable `modes' that are themselves somehow unstable, in the sense that computations tend to drift away from them towards stabler configurations." The "drifting away" is precisely what fails to happen for

Reference-contexts: The highly specialized structure of the matrices (9) and (10) accounts for the difference between our experience with randomly generated examples (reported below) and the experience of Trefethen and Schreiber <ref> [8] </ref>, who worked with randomly generated dense matrices and observed an average growth rate of k 2=3 for real k fi k matrices when partial pivoting was used.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. It is well known that when Gaussian elimination with row partial pivoting is applied to a k fi k real matrix, a growth factor of up to 2 k1 may be observed in the upper triangular factor. A matrix which achieves this upper bound, due to Wilkinson <ref> [9, p.212] </ref>, has passed into the folklore of numerical linear algebra.

Reference-contexts: Since element growth in row partial pivoting is at worst exponential in the bandwidth, the type of growth depicted above cannot occur. Alternative stable and efficient means for producing factorizations of the matrices (9) are available. Wright <ref> [10] </ref> has described a structured QR factorization scheme for these matrices and proved its stability. (A later modification of this scheme, based on Givens rotations rather than Householder transformations, is stable while being not much less efficient than the LU algorithm discussed above.)
