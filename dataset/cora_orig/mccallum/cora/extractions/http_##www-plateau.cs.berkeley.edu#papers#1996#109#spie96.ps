Abstract: Many image and video compression schemes perform the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to represent image data in frequency space. An analysis of a broad suite of images confirms previous finding that a Laplacian distribution can be used to model the luminance AC coefficients. This model is expanded and applied to color space (Cr/Cb) coefficients. In MPEG, the DCT is used to code interframe prediction error terms. The distribution of these coefficients is explored. Finally, the distribution model is applied to improve dynamic generation of quantization matrices.

Reference-contexts: The graph on the right (b) presents the data from the table on the left (a). The image distributions are Laplacian, according to the Kolmogorov test <ref> [1] </ref>. Hypothesis tests were performed using the distribution data and the derived distribution parameters. The Kolmogorov test works by comparing the order statistics of the sample distribution with the theoretical distribution, and testing the largest difference against a theoretically determined difference.

An IEEE compliant floating point implementation of the DCT was employed for these tests. These data files were analyzed to find the appropriate parameter for each distribution.

Reference-contexts: A table of perceptually weighted coefficients can be determined from experiments measuring the detectability of the cosine basis functions and normalizing the coefficients (or using techniques like <ref> [9] </ref>). Then, to find a base matrix, multiply each MSE-optimal Q by the perceptual weighting, and collect them in a matrix.
