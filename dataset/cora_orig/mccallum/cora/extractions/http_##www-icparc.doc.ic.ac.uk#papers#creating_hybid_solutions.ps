Abstract: This paper presents an ongoing research in developing hybrid algorithms suitable for complex optimisation problems in CHIC-2 project (Esprit Project 22165). We present the modelling and solving of the Bouygues' application by two project partners: IC-Parc and Bouygues. The Bouygues' application is an inventory management problem which consists of two subproblems: a resource allocation subproblem and a maintenance scheduling subproblem. We demonstrate hybrid approaches which improve significantly the current results with respect to cost, quality, and integration.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the time period is not too long, so that the data can be considered certain. 2 2 Different Approaches 2.1 Resolution without decomposition The data model used by Bouygues is an object-oriented implementation in the CLAIRE language <ref> [1] </ref>. Concerning input data, order requests, resource types, and resources are defined as instances of the corresponding classes. The constraints are not explicitly represented. The verification is done during the solution search.

Reference-contexts: The IC-Parc's algorithm is a hybridisation of constraint logic programming and mixed integer programming (MIP). The problem is solved by combining two solvers: the finite domain solver in ECLiPSe [3] and the MIP solver in CPLEX <ref> [2] </ref>. Constraint logic programming is used as a modelling language for both solvers. The problem is defined in ECLiPSe and the program is unfolded into the conjunction of linear constraints which represent a mathematical programming model [5].

Reference-contexts: The resource allocation part (the core problem), can be regarded as an extension of a multi-dimensional knapsack problem. Several branch-and-bound algorithms with good average-case performance on knapsack problems have been presented in the literature <ref> [4] </ref>. Mixed integer programming is a good candidate for solving this problem. On the other hand, the scheduling part is usually better to solve with constraint reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Constraint logic programming is used as a modelling language for both solvers. The problem is defined in ECLiPSe and the program is unfolded into the conjunction of linear constraints which represent a mathematical programming model <ref> [5] </ref>. Since the ECLiPSe platform uses CPLEX as a MIP solver, the linear constraints are automatically considered by CPLEX which solves the problem and returns the optimal solution to ECLiPSe.

Reference-contexts: Mixed integer programming is a good candidate for solving this problem. On the other hand, the scheduling part is usually better to solve with constraint reasoning. Finite domain solvers have been successfully used on scheduling applications <ref> [6] </ref>. 3 The decomposition applied by Bouygues and IC-Parc consists in resolv-ing the core problem (to optimality if possible) and then trying to place maintenance times. However the resolution of the core problem and the maintenance scheduling is completely different in both approaches.
