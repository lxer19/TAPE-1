Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The pursuit of low-power applications that exploit the theory of energy recovery <ref> [1] </ref> has focussed upon two means for viably delivering and recovering CMOS circuit energies: stepwise charging and resonant charging. The key advantages of stepwise charging over resonant charging have been modularity, low-cost integration, and asynchronous operation. A practical application of stepwise charging is described elsewhere in these proceedings [2].

Reference-contexts: The key advantages of stepwise charging over resonant charging have been modularity, low-cost integration, and asynchronous operation. A practical application of stepwise charging is described elsewhere in these proceedings <ref> [2] </ref>. Conversely, the potential advantage of resonant charging is succinctly demonstrated in the graph of Figure 1. The provably best way to charge and discharge a capacitance through a resistance is via constant-current charging. takes the voltage level at the load to reach 95% of its swing.

Reference-contexts: The caveat is that the input voltage must exceed that of the maximum output voltage swing. Also plotted in this graph are laboratory measurements from a stepwise-charged pad-driver implementation ( ns, ns) and a resonant clock driver, called the blip circuit ( ns) <ref> [3] </ref>. The latter is an all-resonant circuit topology which generates the clock timing signals depicted in Figure 2c.

Reference-contexts: The third design was the most aggressive in attempting energy recovery. It derived all of its operating power from its two clock lines using bootstrapped circuit techniques <ref> [4] </ref>. All three designs were carried out to the level of layout using the tool Magic and the MOSIS scalable CMOS design rules. They were simulated in HSPICE from extracted layout. The CMOS technology was a 2 m m n-well Orbit process offered through MOSIS 2. <p> A block diagram for the dual-rail full adder is shown in Figure 3. The full adder consists of two And gates, two Exor gates, one half-cycle Delay, and a special Carry-Generate gate. All logic gates were implemented using bootstrapped logic <ref> [4] </ref>. The schematic for the Exor gate is shown in input is latched on the falling edge of the first (input) phase and the output is driven on the second (output) phase. All inputs must be driven on the input phase of the gate.

Reference-contexts: The filter taps were 1/8, 3/4, and 1/8. All terms added to the output were shifted, sign-extended versions of the input, i.e., the middle 3/4 tap was implemented as 1/2 plus 1/4 <ref> [7] </ref>. The entire design required only two basic cells: a carry-save adder and a delay element. Carry-save adders were used to avoid a six-cycle delay in each adder.

Reference-contexts: The non-recoverable energy of the charge isolated at the gate nodes of the bootstrapped nFETs may be crucial to frequency-versus-power performance, as has been the case in other bootstrapped circuit experiments <ref> [8] </ref>. A second investigation of the bootstrapped circuit approach based on minimizing this effect is the subject of further research. The resonantly-clocked design attempted to balance energy recovery with conventional techniques.
