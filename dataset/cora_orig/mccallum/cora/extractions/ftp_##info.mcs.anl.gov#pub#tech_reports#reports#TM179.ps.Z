Reference-contexts: a scientific method for comparing functions and their graphs goes back to the French mathematician Henri Poincare, who, in the first volume of his monograph Les methodes nouvelles de la mecanique celeste (1892), established a theoretical framework for the asymptotic approximation by series that are divergent in the customary sense <ref> [1, Chapter 7] </ref>. Divergent series had received the attention of various mathematicians in the eighteenth and nineteenth century; in fact, it is still instructive to consider Euler's 1 publication [2] of 1754 on the subject. <p> Readers who are interested in oscillatory functions are referred to the literature on the subject; we mention the monographs of Nayfeh [8] and Roseau [9, 10]. Exercises 1. Find the asymptotic expansion of f, defined by f (*; x) = (1 *x=(1 + *)) 1 for x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, with respect to the asymptotic sequence (a) f (*=(1 + *)) n : n = 0; 1; : : :g, and (b) f* n : n = 0; 1; : : :g. 9 7 Regular Initial Value Problems We conclude this chapter with an example to illustrate the concept

Reference-contexts: Divergent series had received the attention of various mathematicians in the eighteenth and nineteenth century; in fact, it is still instructive to consider Euler's 1 publication <ref> [2] </ref> of 1754 on the subject. Euler discussed the series S (x) = n=0 which diverges for all x 2 R except x = 0.

Reference-contexts: Du Bois-Reymond singled out the crucial notion of "asymptotic scales," which was eventually given its rigorous and definitive form by Hardy <ref> [3] </ref>. References to Du Bois-Reymond's articles are given in [3, Appendix 1]. Thus, although the development of asymptotic analysis cannot be traced back to the Babylonians, there existed at least a considerable body of knowledge related to the subject 2 prior to Poincare. <p> Du Bois-Reymond singled out the crucial notion of "asymptotic scales," which was eventually given its rigorous and definitive form by Hardy [3].

But the honors certainly go to Poincare, who introduced the concept of an asymptotic expansion. <p> The notation O and o goes back to Pfeiffer [4, p. 1-21], Bachmann [5, p. 401], and Landau [6, p. 61]; O and o are known as the Landau symbols. Sometimes, we shall use a notation due to Hardy <ref> [3] </ref>, writing f g instead of f = O (g) and f OE g instead of f = o (g). The symbol O ] is denoted O s in Eckhaus [7]. <p> The following theorem, essentially due to Du Bois-Reymond, shows that this is not the case <ref> [3] </ref>. Theorem 2 For every asymptotic sequence fffi n : n = 0; 1; : : :g there exists an order function ffi 2 O such that ffi = o (ffi n ) for all n. Proof.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes, we shall use a notation due to Hardy [3], writing f g instead of f = O (g) and f OE g instead of f = o (g). The symbol O ] is denoted O s in Eckhaus <ref> [7] </ref>. If f = O ] (g), then there exist positive constants C 1 and C 2 such that C 1 g (*) &lt; f (*) &lt; C 2 g (*) for all * 2 (0; * 0 ). We often omit the quantifier "as * # 0." Exercises 1. <p> The set of all order functions is denoted by O. The set O is sufficient for the asymptotic study of all continuous positive-valued functions, as the following theorem shows. The theorem was first formulated by Eckhaus <ref> [7] </ref>. Theorem 1 For every continuous positive-valued function f on (0; * 0 ) there exists an element ffi 2 O such that f = O ] (ffi). Proof. If lim *#0 f (*) exists and is (finite and) positive, it suffices to take ffi (*) = 1.
