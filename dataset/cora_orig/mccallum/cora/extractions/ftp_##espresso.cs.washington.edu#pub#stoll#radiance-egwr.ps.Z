Title: Wavelet Radiance

Affiliation: University of Washington  
Abstract: In this paper, we show how wavelet analysis can be used to provide an efficient solution method for global illumination with glossy and diffuse reflections. Wavelets are used to sparsely represent radiance distribution functions and the transport operator. In contrast to previous wavelet methods (for radiosity), our algorithm transports light directly among wavelets, and eliminates the pushing and pulling procedures. The framework we describe supports curved surfaces and spatially-varying anisotropic BRDFs. We use importance to make the global illumination problem tractable for complex scenes, and we use a final gathering step to improve the visual quality of the solution.

Reference-contexts: Radiance L (y ! z) is defined as the power emanating from y, per unit solid angle in the direction towards z, per unit projected area perpendicular to that direction. At equilibrium, radiance satisfies the following transport equation <ref> [10] </ref>: L (y ! z) = L e (y ! z) + x In this equation, L e (y ! z) is the emitted radiance from y in the direction towards z, and dx is an infinitesimal area around point x. <p> Christensen, E. Stollnitz, D. Salesin and T. DeRose The main algorithm calls on a refinement oracle, described in Sect. 4.3, to refine the radiance transport matrix. Just as in previous hierarchical radiosity algorithms <ref> [10] </ref>, the matrices e T, e L, and e L e are never formed explicitly. Entries of e L and e L e are associated with the surface patches, while entries of e T are stored as "links" between radiance coefficients.

Reference-contexts: In the course of numerically approximating a transport coefficient, the geometric term and the BRDF are sampled at a number of points. The reflectance for each point is determined by a look-up in a texture map, multiplied by the angular variation given by Ward's model. Gershbein et al. <ref> [12] </ref> present an alternative approach, using wavelet decompositions of textures for radiosity. 5.3 Light Sources By storing the wavelet decomposition of an image as the initial coefficients on a patch, we can model a light source that emits a spatially-varying radiance (like a television screen).

This "refinement image" verifies that most work is performed in areas that are both bright and important. 5.5 Final Gather Following the ideas that Reichert <ref> [19] </ref> used for radiosity, we have implemented a final radiance gathering step. For each pixel in the image, we perform a final gathering of light to the surface point that corresponds to the midpoint of the pixel.

These functions have the advantage of being naturally defined on the sphere, thereby eliminating the need for projection to the plane. <p> There are many possible extensions to the present algorithm. Wavelet bases are not suited to the representation of ideal specular reflections. Instead, a ray tracing step for ideal specular reflection could be incorporated in the same fashion as in Sillion et al. <ref> [22] </ref>. Furthermore, surfaces that transmit light in addition to reflecting it could be incorporated into our algorithm by using a wavelet basis defined for the entire sphere of directions.

Reference-contexts: Christensen, E. Stollnitz, D. Salesin and T. DeRose of wavelets rather than scaling functions. Our method does not require the pushing and pulling procedures. We also incorporate importance-driven refinement, as described by Smits et al. <ref> [23] </ref> for radiosity, to avoid unnecessary work in computing viewpoint-dependent solutions of complex scenes. In addition, our implementation supports curved surfaces and anisotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution functions. The framework we describe naturally accommodates spatial variations, described by texture maps, in both emission and reflectance. <p> Importance was described in Smits et al. <ref> [23] </ref> for radiosity and in Christensen et al. [6], Aupperle and Hanrahan [3], and Pattanaik [18] for radiance. Briefly, importance measures the fraction of light leaving a point that will reach the eye. <p> Importance can therefore be discretized in the same manner as radiance and transported by the same links. The only difference between importance and radiance is that radiance is emitted by light sources, while exitant directional importance is emitted by the eye. Smits et al. <ref> [23] </ref> showed that importance gives a substantial speed-up for a Wavelet Radiance 13 complex diffuse scene.

Reference-contexts: When no confusion can arise, we suppress the arguments and simply write L = BL. In the original formulation of radiosity, piecewise-constant functions were used as a basis [13]. In subsequent work on radiosity, Zatz [26] and Troutman and Max <ref> [24] </ref> used orthogonal polynomials, and Gortler et al. [14] used wavelets. In the more general context of radiance, the distribution of light leaving a patch has both spatial and angular variation. Immel et al. [16] used piecewise-constant basis functions for both spatial and angular variation.

Reference-contexts: Our implementation currently handles tensor-product Bezier patches and quadrilaterals. It would also be striaghtforward to add non-uniform rational B-spline surfaces. The images in Fig. 3 show a teapot consisting of 28 Bezier patches. 5.2 Reflection Models and Texture Maps We use the Ward isotropic and anisotropic reflection models <ref> [25] </ref> since they are physically valid and fast to evaluate. Examples of this reflection model can be Wavelet Radiance 11 (a) (b) (c) Fig. 3.
