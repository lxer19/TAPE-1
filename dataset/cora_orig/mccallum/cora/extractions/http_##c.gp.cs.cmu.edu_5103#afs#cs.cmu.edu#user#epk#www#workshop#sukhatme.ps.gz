Abstract: Evaluation of mobile robots is a multidimensional problem. There are many performance indices that can be used to compare and evaluate mobile robots. Examples are speed, stability etc. A natural framework for the evaluation of mobile robots is multicriteria evaluation the science of evaluation functions whose output is nonscalar. In this paper we present a methodology for mission oriented mobile robot evaluation using a multicriteria framework. The methodology is illustrated by implementation on a four wheeled micro-rover class robot for mobility performance in a simulated Martian terrain. Our methodology makes use of nondimensional quantities which measure rover mobility with respect to its surroundings so that rovers of different sizes may be meaningfully compared. Ongoing and future work is discussed with regard to implementing the methodology on another robot built in our lab and predicting the values of the evaluation functions using validated simulations.

Of particular interest is the issue of evaluating mobile robots for space applications such as planetary exploration. <p> The main problem with doing isolated tests and then assigning a composite score using a weighted combination technique is that it presupposes the existence of a good model for the combination and involves some amount of arbitrary assignment of weights. Gat <ref> (Gat 1995) </ref> proposed an evaluation technique that is both statistical and mission oriented using Rocky IV as a testbed on simulated Martian rock distributions (both physical and computer simulations).

The result may then be compared against several runs of the real robot.

Reference-contexts: The two main achievements of this method were its independence of scale and easy reproducibility. Its chief drawback was that it used a simple obstacle geometry and did not evaluate the entire system in a mission oriented way. Lietzau <ref> (Lietzau 1993) </ref> proposed a set of benchmarks to assess the performance of a Mars microrover. These benchmarks were divided into five categories namely, mobility, navigation and control, science, autonomy and environmental.

Of particular interest is the issue of evaluating mobile robots for space applications such as planetary exploration. <p> We propose two evaluation metrics here which form the two criteria. We discuss how such 2-vectors may be compared and ranked using techniques from the mul-ticriteria evaluation literature. In December 1996 NASA will launch the pathfinder mission to Mars <ref> (Matthies et al. 1995) </ref>. The mission will deploy an autonomous microrover on the surface of Mars. The robot's primary mission is to do spectroscopic analysis on Martian rocks of interest to scientists on Earth. <p> The evaluation function is also not based on multiple cost functions with all their attendant complexities (such as dealing with vector outputs).

Reference-contexts: Mobile Robot Evaluation Static evaluation techniques are designed for measuring stability when the robot is stationary or when it is moving in a statically stable fashion. The primary method of choice is an energy based stability measure. Early work on robot stability was due to McGhee et al. <ref> (McGhee & Frank 1968) </ref> who defined the support polygon as the convex hull of the projections of all contacting points on a horizontal plane. A walker was considered stable if the projection of center of gravity on the horizontal plane lay within the support polygon.

Reference-contexts: Both use the amount of energy needed to destabilize the walking robot as a measure of the stability of the robot. The energy stability margin was defined in <ref> (Messuri & Klein 1986) </ref> as the minimum work that must be done on a robot walker to tip it over an edge of a support boundary.

Reference-contexts: Indeed wheel slip is not detected at this stage. Such a navigation scheme suffers from the classical problem of drift in dead-reckoning. The different rock placements used for the trials reported here were all drawn from a standard model of expected rock distribution on Mars <ref> (Moore & Jakosky 1989) </ref>. The model is an exponential decay in the diameter of the rocks given in the following equation. N is the cumulative number of rocks per unit area and D is rock diameter.

Reference-contexts: A walker was considered stable if the projection of center of gravity on the horizontal plane lay within the support polygon. In work by Nagy et al. <ref> (Nagy, Desa & Whittaker 1994) </ref> two modes of walker stability are characterized namely stance stability and walker stability. Both use the amount of energy needed to destabilize the walking robot as a measure of the stability of the robot.

Reference-contexts: Research in multicriteria evaluation has focussed largely on generating the so called noninferior set which separates the feasible solutions from the infeasible ones and leaving the final choice of solution to a human designer/specialist. The notion of the non-inferior set was introduced by Pareto <ref> (Pareto 1971) </ref> in the context of a multitude of objectives in economics. The non-inferior set is called the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Literature on methods to find the noninferior set is extensive; (Cohon & Marks 1974) is an example.

Reference-contexts: As an example Skellam <ref> (Skellam 1951) </ref> studied the spread of muskrats over Central Europe. He was able to show that the dispersal of this species over time is a diffusive process with no drift. In other words over small periods of time muskrats effectively execute a random walk.
