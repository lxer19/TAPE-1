Title: Callon Page i Use of OSI IS-IS for Routing in TCP/IP and Dual Environments Status
Note: this memo is unlimited. Comments should be sent to isis@merit.edu-. Contents  
Abstract: This RFC specifies an integrated routing protocol, based on the OSI Intra-Domain IS-IS Routing Protocol, which may be used as an interior gateway protocol (IGP) to support TCP/IP as well as OSI. This allows a single routing protocol to be used to support pure IP environments, pure OSI environments, and dual environments. This specification was developed by the IS-IS working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. The OSI IS-IS protocol has reached a mature state, and is ready for implementation and operational use. The most recent version of the OSI IS-IS protocol is contained in ISO DP 10589 [1]. The proposed standard for using IS-IS for dual routing will therefore make use of this version (with a minor bug correction, as discussed in Annex B). We expect that future versions of this proposed standard will upgrade to the final International Standard version of IS-IS when available.

Reference: [1] <institution> Intermediate System to Intermediate System Intra-Domain Routeing Exchange Protocol for use in Conjunction with the Protocol for Providing the Connectionless mode Network Service (ISO 8473)-, ISO DP 10589, </institution> <month> February </month> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: This specification presents an alternate approach, which makes use of a single integrated protocol for interior routing (i.e., for calculating routes within a routing domain) for both protocol suites. This integrated protocol design is based on the OSI Intra-domain IS-IS routing protocol <ref> [1] </ref>, with IP-specific functions added. This RFC is considered a companion to the OSI IS-IS Routing spec, and will only describe the required additional features. By supporting both IP and OSI traffic, this integrated protocol design supports traffic to IP hosts, OSI end systems, and dual end systems. <p> For example, such routers would not be able to forward OSI CLNP packets. RFC 1195 OSI ISIS for IP and Dual Environments December, 1990 Callon Page 2 An OSI-only router is defined to be a router which uses IS-IS as the routing protocol for OSI, as specified in <ref> [1] </ref>. Generally, OSI-only routers may be expected to conform to OSI standards, and may be implemented independent of this specification. <p> The specific topological restrictions which apply in this latter case are described in detail in section 1.4 (Support of Mixed Routing Domains). The use of IS-IS for support of pure OSI domains is specified in <ref> [1] </ref>. This protocol specification does not constrain which network management protocol (s) may be used to manage IS-IS-based routers. <p> This reduces the potential n-squared links to n links. In addition, only the pseudonode LSP includes the list of end systems on the LAN, thereby eliminating the potential duplication (for further information on designated routers and pseudonodes, see <ref> [1] </ref>). The IS-IS provides for optional Quality of Service (QOS) routing, based on throughput (the default metric), delay, expense, or residual error probability. This is described in greater detail in section 3.5, and in [1]. 1.3 Overview of the Integrated IS-IS The integrated IS-IS allows a single routing protocol to be <p> the LAN, thereby eliminating the potential duplication (for further information on designated routers and pseudonodes, see <ref> [1] </ref>). The IS-IS provides for optional Quality of Service (QOS) routing, based on throughput (the default metric), delay, expense, or residual error probability. This is described in greater detail in section 3.5, and in [1]. 1.3 Overview of the Integrated IS-IS The integrated IS-IS allows a single routing protocol to be used to route both IP and OSI packets. This implies that the same two-level hierarchy will be used for both IP and OSI routing. <p> With the S.I.N. approach, completely separate routing protocols are used for IP and for OSI. For example, OSPF [5] may be used for routing IP traffic, and IS-IS <ref> [1] </ref> may be used for routing OSI traffic. With S.I.N., the two routing protocols operate more or less independently. However, dual routers will need to implement both routing protocols, and therefore there will be some degree of competition for resources. <p> The OSI IS-IS <ref> [1] </ref> allows for LSPs and CSNPs to be split into multiple packets. This is independent of ISO 8473 segmentation, and is also independent of IP fragmentation. <p> The Integrated IS-IS makes use of the same multiple packet function, as defined in <ref> [1] </ref>. IP-specific fields in IS-IS packets may be split across multiple packets. <p> For determination of the shortest path, if a route on which the specified TOS is supported is available, then the specified TOS metric is used, otherwise the default metric is used. Amongst routes of equal cost, loadsplitting may be performed as specified in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> For determination of the shortest path, if a route on which the specified TOS is supported is available, then the specified TOS metric is used, otherwise the default metric is used. Amongst routes of equal cost, loadsplitting may be performed as specified in <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.10.2 Order of Preference of Routes in Level 2 Routing For those level 2 routers which also take part in level 1 routing, routes learned via level 1 routing, using either the requested TOS or the default TOS, are always prefered to routes learned through level 2 routing. <p> For determination of the shortest path, if a route on which the specified TOS is supported is available, then the specified TOS metric is used, otherwise the default metric is used. Amongst routes of equal cost, loadsplitting may be performed as specified in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> For determination of the shortest path: (i) Routes with a smaller announced external metric are always prefered. (ii) Amongst routes with an equal external metric, routes with a shorter internal metric are prefered. Amongst routes of equal cost, loadsplitting may be performed as speci fied in <ref> [1] </ref>. For level 2 routers which are announcing manually configured summary addresses in their level 2 LSPs, in some cases there will exist IP addresses which match the manually configured addresses, but which do not match any addresses which are actually reachable via level 1 routing in the area. <p> In this case, the IS-IS Hello transmitted on that interface may omit the IP Interface Address field, or may include the IP Interface Address field with zero entries. 4.3 LANs, Designated Routers, and Pseudonodes The maintenance of designated routers and pseudonodes is specified in <ref> [1] </ref>, and is not changed by this proposal. In the case that IP-only and dual routers (or OSI-only and dual routers) are mixed on the same LAN in a pure IP area (or a pure OSI area, respectively), any router on the LAN may be elected designated router. <p> Specifically, the same packet types are used as in IS-IS <ref> [1] </ref>, and all fixed fields remain the same. Additional variable length fields are defined in this section. 5.1 Overview of IS-IS PDUs The packets used in IS-IS routing protocol fall into three main classes: (i) Hello Packets; (ii) Link State Packets (LSPs); and (iii) Sequence Number Packets (SNPs). <p> In general, an IS-IS PDU may contain multiple variable length fields, some of which contain OSI-specific information (specified in <ref> [1] </ref>) and some of which contain IP-specific information (specified below). Except where explicitly stated otherwise, these variable length fields may occur in any order. <p> Where a particular field may be present in more than one type of PDU, the field is repeated for each type of PDU to which it applies. Bit and octet numbering is the same as in <ref> [1] </ref>. In particular, octets in a PDU are numbered starting from 1, in increasing order. Bits in an octet are numbered from 1 to 8, where bit 1 is the least significant bit and is pictured on the right.

Reference-contexts: This approach does not change the way that IP packets are handled. IP-only and dual routers are required to conform to the requirements of Internet Gateways <ref> [4] </ref>. The integrated IS-IS protocol described in this report outlines an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) which will provide routing within a TCP/IP routing domain (i.e., autonomous system). Other aspects of router functionality (e.g., operation of ICMP, ARP, EGP, etc.) are not affected by this proposal. <p> The pseudonode LSP does not specify the IP addresses which are reachable on the LAN (i.e., does not contain the the IP reachability field). As specified elsewhere (see the forthcoming update to the Requirements of IP Gateways <ref> [4] </ref>), routers may send ICMP redirects only if: (i) the IP packet is being forwarded over the same physical interface over which it arrived; and (ii) the source address of the forwarded IP packet, the IP address of this router's interface (as indicated by the source address of the ICMP redirect),

Reference-contexts: RFC 1195 OSI ISIS for IP and Dual Environments December, 1990 Callon Page 8 An alternative approach is known as Ships In the Night (S.I.N.). With the S.I.N. approach, completely separate routing protocols are used for IP and for OSI. For example, OSPF <ref> [5] </ref> may be used for routing IP traffic, and IS-IS [1] may be used for routing OSI traffic. With S.I.N., the two routing protocols operate more or less independently. However, dual routers will need to implement both routing protocols, and therefore there will be some degree of competition for resources.
