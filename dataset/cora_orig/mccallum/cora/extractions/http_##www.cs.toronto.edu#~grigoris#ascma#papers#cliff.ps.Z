Reference-contexts: Gas have been used for parameter optimization in a wide variety of problem domains [25]. The usage described below is reminiscent of some work in evolving parameters affecting back-propagation learning in artificial neural networks (e.g., <ref> [36, 2] </ref>), but the only connection between zip traders and back-propagation networks is that both are based on use of the Widrow-Hoff learning rule with momentum.

In Smith's experiments, human subjects were told to be either buyers or sellers. Each seller was given a number of units of an arbitrary commodity to sell and each buyer was given the right to buy some units, and some currency. <p> The values for start low, but increase to around 0.4-0.6 over the first 40 generations, falling down to '0.1 over generations 40-60.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The continuous double-auction (cda) is a powerful market mechanism, noted for its speed and efficiency <ref> [22] </ref>, and is the mechanism underlying the organization of open-outcry `trading pits' at major international derivatives markets. <p> Cliff & Bruten [10, 13] demonstrated that Gode & Sunder's result only holds in very specific circumstances and that, in general, some `intelligence' in the 2 For example, the following 30 texts approvingly cite Gode & Sunder's 1993 JPE paper on ZI traders: [3, pp.230-231], [5, pp.253, 258], [21, p.19], <ref> [22, p.xxiii] </ref>, [32, pp.292, 294], [39, pp.160-161, 175], [19, p.132], [33, p.2], [26, p.1082], [43, p.310], [1, p.186], [4, p.674] [27, 81], [45, p.475], [6, pp.1318, 1333], [17, p.678], [18, p.383], [29, p.276], [20, p.623], and [24, pp.604-605]. form of adaptivity or sensitivity to previous and current events in the market

Reference-contexts: Although it may seem intuitively obvious that some form of `intelligence' or adaptation is necessary in trader-agents, Gode & Sunder <ref> [23] </ref> presented results that appear to indicate that zero-intelligence agents can exhibit human-like behavior in cda markets. Gode & Sunder's zero-intelligence trading agents simply generated random prices for bids or offers, subject to the constraint that they could not enter into loss-making deals. <p> In these publications, the dynamics of markets populated by zip traders were explored using various simple experimental supply and demand curves similar to those used by Smith [41] or Gode & Sunder <ref> [23] </ref>. Cliff & Bruten [10, 12] presented results illustrating zip traders operating successfully in cda markets where Gode & Sunder's [23] zero-intelligence traders fail. These examples include markets where there are asymmetric supply and demand functions and imbalances between the number of buyers and sellers. <p> publications, the dynamics of markets populated by zip traders were explored using various simple experimental supply and demand curves similar to those used by Smith [41] or Gode & Sunder <ref> [23] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These agents give very good performance on standard measures of trading activity such as allocative efficiency, Smith's <ref> [41] </ref> `ff' measure of price convergence, and profit dispersion, but only when parameters governing the adaptation mechanism are set to appropriate values. Determining good or optimal combinations of parameters by hand is possible, but can be labor-intensive. <p> Yet, in a series of experiments commencing in the late 1950's, Smith (e.g. <ref> [41] </ref>) demonstrated that markets consisting of surprisingly small numbers of human traders could rapidly converge on the theoretical equilibrium price given by the intersection of the market's supply and demand curves. <p> In these publications, the dynamics of markets populated by zip traders were explored using various simple experimental supply and demand curves similar to those used by Smith <ref> [41] </ref> or Gode & Sunder [23]. Cliff & Bruten [10, 12] presented results illustrating zip traders operating successfully in cda markets where Gode & Sunder's [23] zero-intelligence traders fail.

This convergence is quantified in Fig. 3, where summary statistics for zip performance in the market of Fig. 1 are shown: in each experiment, Smith's <ref> [41] </ref> ff measure of convergence 4 is calculated for each day; Fig. 3 shows the mean and standard deviation of ff in each day over 50 such experiments.
