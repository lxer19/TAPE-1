Reference-contexts: SAIF/ZIP is a conceptually simple format in which SAIF data objects are stored in a SAIF dataset as compressed ASCII OSN (the SAIF language for expressing data). The OSN is compressed and decompressed using off the shelf software compatible with the ZIP standard as defined in <ref> [1] </ref>. The SAIF/ZIP format also allows for files of an arbitary format to be bundled with SAIF data and transported or archived as a unit. Developers using the SAIF Toolkit need not be aware of the details of this document, though an understanding of the terminology is useful.

Reference-contexts: The SAIF Toolkit stores and retrieves data on behalf client applications to and from SAIF/ZIP datasets in the format described in this document. This document supplements the material in the Compression Study Final Report <ref> [2] </ref> and the Concept Paper [3], and builds on the Sequential Compressed File Structure [4] notes prepared by SRMB. This document is part of the SAIF Toolkit Design Document set. Section 2 defines terms which are used in the discussion of the SAIF/ZIP format.

Reference-contexts: SAIF/ZIP has replaced SAIF/XDR as the recommended encoding method for SAIF data exchange. To understand this document, readers must be familiar with SAIF. Document <ref> [5] </ref> contains the formal description of SAIF. SAIF/ZIP is a conceptually simple format in which SAIF data objects are stored in a SAIF dataset as compressed ASCII OSN (the SAIF language for expressing data). <p> This file is optional. If there is no importing of objects then it may not be present in the SAIF dataset. 3.7 Arbitrary files The SAIF/ZIP format allows arbitrary files to be embedded in a SAIF dataset. Such files are referenced by instances of the ExternalReference defined in <ref> [5] </ref>. This facility can be used to package imagery with a SAIF/ZIP dataset. When a file is embedded into a SAIF/ZIP dataset, an ExternalReference will be created for it. The address field of the ExternalReference will be set to STK_EMBEDDED_FILE:filename to indicate that the file was embedded in the dataset.
