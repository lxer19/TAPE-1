Title: An Implementation of the Contract Net Protocol Based on Marginal Cost Calculations

Abstract: This paper presents a formalization of the bidding and awarding decision process that was left undefined in the original contract net task allocation protocol. This formalization is based on marginal cost calculations based on local agent criteria. In this way, agents having very different local criteria (based on their self-interest) can interact to distribute tasks so that the network as a whole functions more effectively. In this model, both competitive and cooperative agents can interact. In addition, the contract net protocol is extended to allow for clustering of tasks, to deal with the possibility of a large number of announcement and bid messages and to effectively handle situations, in which new bidding and awarding is being done during the period when the results of previous bids are unknown. The protocol is verified by the TRACONET (TRAnsportation COoperation NET) system, where dispatch centers of different companies cooperate automatically in vehicle routing. The implementation is asynchronous and truly distributed, and it provides the agents extensive autonomy. The protocol is discussed in detail and test results with real data are presented. 1

Reference-contexts: In our system, each item (task set) is different and task sets of different announcements are highly interdependent. In the equilibrium approach of <ref> (Kuwabara and Ishida 1992) </ref>, at each iteration, the seller sets the price based on demand and the buyers state the quantity they want to buy. Section 2 presents the architecture of our implementation. Section 3 discusses the local control strategy of an agent.

Reference-contexts: This is how a solution closer to the global optimum is reached although no global optimization run is performed. The use of contract nets as opposed to centralized problem solving is most fruitful in operative decision making in volatile domains such as ours and the factory domain of <ref> (Parunak 1987) </ref>. The negotiation is real-time since after each contract is made the exchange of deliveries is made immediately. Thus, between individual negotiations some delivery orders may have been dispatched, new orders may have arrived, and the available vehicles may have changed. <p> Each agent is implemented as one HP-UX (UNIX) process. The agents negotiate over the file system and share no memory. sense that an announcement is not sent to all other agents <ref> (Parunak 1987) </ref>, fig.1. The agents have no fixed hierarchy among themselves. An agent can act both as a manager and a contractor of delivery sets, but it does not have to take both roles, nor is it required to negotiate with all other agents.

Reference-contexts: Every delivery has to be included in the route of some vehicle. The local problem of each agent is a heterogeneous fleet multi-depot routing problem, where the vehicle attributes include cost per kilometer, maximum route duration, maximum route length, maximum load weight and maximum load volume <ref> (Sandholm 1992a) </ref>. The objective is to minimize the transportation costs. In solving the problem, each dispatch center - represented by one intelligent agent 2 - first solves its local 2 Another choice would be that each agent represented one vehicle. <p> A detailed presentation of these experiments is given in <ref> (Sandholm 1992a) </ref>. Table 1 provides results of one example experiment. As can be seen, the negotiations led to considerable transportation cost savings in reasonable time even in such a large problem. In the experiment, company A owned the first three centers and company B owned the last two. <p> In the experiment, company A owned the first three centers and company B owned the last two. The centers were located around Finland. The agents had similar local optimization modules and each agent's original local routing solution was acquired heuristically using a parallel insertion algorithm <ref> (Sandholm 1992a) </ref>. Each agent executed on its own HP 9000 s300 workstation. The profit of each contract was divided in half between the agents, i.e., the actual price of a contract was half way between the maximum price mentioned in the announcement and the bid price.

Reference-contexts: The announcing methods differ from each other in the number of tasks (deliveries) to be clustered into each announcement, and in whether a delivery set that has already been announced can be reannounced <ref> (Sandholm 1992b) </ref>. Reannouncing leads to better results, but the negotiations are considerably longer. This, however, is not a serious problem, if we assume that actual deliveries are being done during the negotiations and reannouncing is not done immediately. <p> To solve it, TRACONET's more refined announcer algorithms use domain dependent heuristics. These algorithms and experiments with them in a domain, where all deliveries originate at a common factory have been discussed in <ref> (Sandholm 1992b) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is usually the case, if the network has many agents. In the original CNP, an agent could have multiple bids concerning different contracts pending concurrently in order to speed up the operation of the system <ref> (Smith 1980) </ref>. We have followed this approach for the same reason, although negotiations over only one contract at a time allow a more precise bid price.

Reference-contexts: Agents in the same negotiation network can use different local optimization algorithms tuned to the requirements of each center separately.

Reference-contexts: Thus, between individual negotiations some delivery orders may have been dispatched, new orders may have arrived, and the available vehicles may have changed. There is no iteration among the agents until an equilibrium is reached unlike the approach of <ref> (Wellman 1992) </ref>, where the bids include a number of the similar items an agent wants to buy and it is assumed that the purchase of one type of items is independent of the purchase of other types of items. <p> This is because in this domain, both economies of scale (implying c all add (T b ) ) and diseconomies of scale (implying c non add (T b ) &lt; c a l l add (T b ) ) are present. In <ref> (Wellman 1992) </ref>, only diseconomies of scale are present. The cost c n o n add (T b ) is faster to compute than c all add (T b ), and it gives a better approximation of c add (T b ) when bids are seldom awarded to the agent.
