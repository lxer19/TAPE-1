Now we can appeal to the following completeness assumption: Axiom (2) characterizes all the conditions under which action a leads to y being broken.

Reference-contexts: A plan to achieve a certain goal G (s) is obtained as a side effect of a proof of (9s)G (s) from premises axiomatizing the domain of application and conditions holding in the initial state S 0 (Green <ref> [2] </ref>). Any binding for the variable s as a result of such a proof is a successful plan.

We illustrate Schubert's approach with an example. Consider the fluent holding, and suppose that both holding (r; x; s) and :holding (r; x; do (a; s)) are true.

Reference-contexts: The plausibility of this transformation relies solely on the assumed completeness of the fluent preconditions. Notice also the intimate connection between the completeness assumption and the so-called qualification problem (McCarthy <ref> [4] </ref>). By assuming complete information about fluent preconditions, we are effectively assuming no qualifications about these preconditions. Equivalently, if there are any unstated qualifications, we are taking them to be false. The completeness assumption makes no such claims about possible qualifications for the action preconditions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Ever since it was first pointed out by McCarthy and Hayes in 1969 <ref> [5] </ref>, the frame problem has remained an obstacle to the formalization of dynamically changing worlds. Despite many attempts, no completely satisfactory solution has been obtained. <p> :broken (y; do (repair (r; x); s)): Here, repair (r; x; s) is hasglue (r; s) ^ broken (x; s), the precondition for robot r to repair object x in state s. " repair (r; x; y; s) is y = x. 2.2 Frame Axioms As has been long recognized <ref> [5] </ref>, axioms other than effect axioms are required for formalizing dynamic worlds. These are called frame axioms, and they specify the action invariants of the domain, i.e., those fluents unaf fected by the performance of an action.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, we have two objectives in this chapter: 1. To provide an analysis of two recent proposals for dealing with the frame problem in the situation calculus (Pednault <ref> [6] </ref>, Schubert [9]) and to show how they can be combined, under a suitable closure assumption that is appropriate in settings when the effects of all actions on all fluents can be specified. 2. <p> We follow this by a survey of two different approaches to solving the frame problem, namely, the proposals of Pednault <ref> [6] </ref> and Schubert [9].

Reference-contexts: It follows that the axiomatization of this chapter provides a specification for database updates, and that 21 Theorem 2 yields a sound and complete query evaluation mechanism for databases after arbitrary updates. A companion paper (Reiter <ref> [7] </ref>) will describe in greater detail how the formalism described here characterizes update transactions in databases.

Reference-contexts: To show how the axioms arising from the analysis of 1. provide a systematic treatment of goal regression (Waldinger [10]) for plan synthesis, together with natural conditions under which regression is provably sound and complete. Proofs for all results in this chapter may be found in (Reiter <ref> [8] </ref>). 1 2 2 Axiomatizing Change In this section, we describe a class of axioms that characterize the effects of actions on fluents. We follow this by a survey of two different approaches to solving the frame problem, namely, the proposals of Pednault [6] and Schubert [9]. <p> The ideas of this chapter can be extended in several ways: 1. Composite actions are sequences of primitive actions. For any such composite action, we wish to determine the action precondition and successor state axioms for each fluent. It turns out (Reiter <ref> [8] </ref>) that these axioms can be characterized in terms of the regression operator, which also provides a means for computing them. It is also possible to prove various properties of composite actions, e.g., equivalence, impossibility, etc. 2.

Sherlock Holmes, A Study in Scarlet This section provides foundations for a systematic, backward-reasoning-style proof theory for plan synthesis, usually called goal regression (Waldin-ger <ref> [10] </ref>). The approach substantially generalizes some ideas of Pednault [6], who considers goal regression within the setting defined by his solution to the frame problem. Our objective is a method for establishing that F j= (9s)G (s) ^ ex (s) whenever F is a suitable axiomatization of a dynamic world.
