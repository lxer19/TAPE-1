Abstract: We examine the rationale for and systems aspects of using layered coding for the transmission of images and video over heterogeneous communication networks. We advocate Multi-resolution Layered Coding (MLC) and present architectural alternatives that can support it within the scope of existing standards and technologies. Since the premise of layered coding is controlled loss, the issues of error control and concealment are central. We demonstrate that MLC exhibits good error tolerance, effectively compensating for errors in situations where traditional error concealment schemes, based on the interpolation of pixels in adjacent blocks, are ineffective. In particular, MLC yields a higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) than two-layer coding when packet loss occurs in the base layer. Finally, we show that MLC can effectively exploit efficient network error control strategies which distribute redundancy non-uniformly and provide unequal levels of protection across layers.

Reference-contexts: Packet loss during transmission can damage a sequence of blocks and this is exacerbated when the coding scheme uses run-length encoding, as most schemes do. Numerous techniques for error concealment have been developed, all of them consistently exploiting the spatial and possibly temporal redundancy of the picture components <ref> [3] </ref>. In intracoded frames, spatial interpolation methods are used to conceal errors, replacing pixels in damaged blocks with interpolated pixel values from surrounding blocks.

Reference-contexts: Reduced bandwidth transmission: High quality images can be transmitted faster over low-bandwidth chan nels, at lower resolution. 4. Resolution refinement: This is the ability to produce still images at higher resolution than when viewed in motion <ref> [4] </ref>. If the various frames in a motion video are hierarchically coded, then only the acceptable resolution components can be decoded at the receiver, while the higher resolution components can be cached, to be used only for still frame display. This reduces the decoding time for the common case. 5.

Reference-contexts: Despite considerable efforts to perfect concealment schemes exploiting spatial and temporal redundancies for non-layered coding, only a few efforts have been reported specifically for LC, most concentrating on video.

Indeed, most authors assume that the base layer can be adequately protected. However, errors in the base layer cannot be effectively concealed in the absence of a reference picture and accurate motion vectors.

Reference-contexts: Facilitating translation at the receiver through synthesis of the signal from separate components can be achieved through LC. In addition, admission control and routing algorithms may take into account the different needs and capabilities of the destinations by, for example, forwarding only usable components to select destinations <ref> [6] </ref>. Furthermore, there is an interesting interaction between LC and multicasting. MLC enables destinations to adjust the quality of the signal they receive each, independently and without the source actually being aware of this adjustment (of course, the adjustment is only possible towards lower quality).

Reference-contexts: Now consider a MLC image with a resolution of (W; H). Each layer in the image pyramid is recursively generated by convoluting the original image L with the interpolation kernel h (m; n) <ref> [8] </ref>. The image is first decimated and reduced in resolution by a factor of r in each dimension through downsampling.

Reference-contexts: An inefficient sampling filter can cause further error corrections in the following layers and lead to a lower compression ratio. initial results, 4 reported in <ref> [9] </ref>. Note also that compression ratio also depends on image content and quantization level. We have observed that downsampling of reasonable size images (from 200fi150 and up) by 2 both horizontally and vertically yielded almost as acceptable image quality as the full-resolution image (Fig. 2). <p> The mean size for 2-layer HJPEG coding increases by 10.8% (over BJPEG) with a standard deviation of 0.78% for 2 layers. The corresponding numbers for 3 and 4 layers are 14.7% with a 4 In <ref> [9] </ref> comparison was made between a 3-layer HJPEG image (downsampled by 2 in each direction for each layer) and the progressive mode of JPEG. The HJPEG image has about 33% overhead over the image coded with the progressive mode. <p> In addition, a new priority structure, potential support for reservations and QoS guarantees, etc., are introduced with IPv6 and related technologies such as RSVP [32] and others. 10 HAN & POLYZOS IV. Error Control and Concealment A. Past Work on Error Concealment Many compression standards such as JPEG <ref> [9] </ref>, MPEG [33], and H.261 [34] and its variants, use the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) applied to blocks of image samples. The coefficients after the DCT are then quantized and entropy coded in order to increase the compression efficiency. <p> The relative frequency of restart flags can be increased leading to increased robustness at the expense of coding efficiency; this is a basic design trade-off. Note, however, that recovery is not possible from all error conditions; in particular, header information loss is catastropic <ref> [9] </ref>. The impact of the loss of synchronization with various coding schemes is depicted in Fig. 6. A restart flag every 8 lines is used in this case. We observe that with proper use of resynchronization schemes, the decoding process can maintain synchronization, despite errors leading to block loss. <p> However, the precision of the differential input can be reduced by point transform, which restricts coding-decoding difference at a significantly lower cost <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To prevent the propagation of the quantization error from a layer, an error feedback loop can be used as shown in Fig. 1.

For example, sudden congestion at a network point would lead to complete disruption of service, i.e., freezing of the video and audio.

Reference-contexts: Given a solution to the inter-media synchronization problem that allows for independent media streams, the extension to multiple layers, with each layer using a separate stream is straightforward. A survey of synchronization techniques is presented in <ref> [17] </ref>. The only concern then is the added complexity of synchronizing a larger number of streams.

Reference-contexts: C.1 Congestion Control Layered coding can increase the efficiency of high-speed networks. The main issue for high-speed packet-switching network architectures (e.g., ATM) is the significant congestion control problems that can arise due to the statistical multiplexing of very high burstiness signals <ref> [18] </ref>. A key property of any solution (that is not based on resource reservation at the peak rate of the sources) is the ability to shed load quickly without causing an avalanche of retrans-missions of dropped traffic [19].

Reference-contexts: A key property of any solution (that is not based on resource reservation at the peak rate of the sources) is the ability to shed load quickly without causing an avalanche of retrans-missions of dropped traffic <ref> [19] </ref>. With LC of CM, when network congestion arises it is possible to drop the less important signal components without causing service interruption, and without the need for retransmissions, but instead with a temporary reduction in service quality (which may be unnoticeable in many cases).

Reference-contexts: Schemes proposed for providing ex plicit Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees are rather inefficient <ref> [20] </ref> or depend on the existence of low-priority, "best-effort" traffic in order to improve efficiency. Therefore, efficiency can be considerably increased if the portion of the traffic which requires stringent QoS guarantees is minimized and part of the signal can be transported as "best-effort" traffic.

Reference-contexts: In multicasting, a sender communicates explicitly with a "group," rather than with individual actors which happen to be members of the group. Consequently, the sender need not be knowledgeable of group membership, and in fact, the group membership may change over time <ref> [21] </ref>. A number of dynamic control mechanisms in protocols employ feedback from the receiver to the sender. However, with multicast, how to provide feedback efficiently (or whether it should be provided at all) is a non-trivial question. There are four basic approaches: 1. <p> In point-to-point computer network links, error-free communication is usually achieved by error detection and retransmission. Error control is particularly difficult with multipoint connections because of the feedback related problems (e.g., ACK implosion, conflicting requests, etc. <ref> [21] </ref>). Physical layer error control corrects errors using block or convolutional coding. Essentially, channel error control techniques can be thought of as reducing noise levels.

Reference-contexts: Distribute the control mechanism over the nodes of a multicast tree (typically the same tree used for traffic distribution). 4. Take preventive action to minimize reliance on feedback.

Reference-contexts: Distribute the control mechanism over the nodes of a multicast tree (typically the same tree used for traffic distribution). 4. Take preventive action to minimize reliance on feedback. For example, for error control this means using FEC [22], <ref> [23] </ref> to anticipate errors and provide redundancy, allowing the receivers to reconstruct the information without requiring the sender to retransmit. <p> This is mainly due to signal decomposition and scrambling. Second, because errors have different impact at the various layers (as we will see, again, in section 4), the level of protection provided to each layer, through FEC (e.g., the PET scheme <ref> [23] </ref>) or other means can (and should) be tailored to the importance of the layer in the final image quality. The result of this added protection is that the residual error-rate is different for the various layers.

Reference-contexts: The cost is the additional complexity due to these anticipatory schemes. A communication abstraction promoting open-loop control and providing a service analogous to that of a television broadcast channel is the Multimedia Multicast Channel <ref> [24] </ref>.

The MMC design is independent of specific technologies, such as IP or ATM, but compatible with MLC and network architectures that provide services with different QoS guarantees. A.

Reference-contexts: To support heterogeneity, each receiver may tailor the selected streams to meet individual needs through the use of filters, which, if compatible, can propagate upstream and combine in order to economize on resources <ref> [25] </ref>. C.3 Terminal Heterogeneity Many types of (multimedia) terminals and media representation standards exist and it is expected that the heterogeneity will persist.

Reference-contexts: These schemes are media transparent and errors are corrected perfectly as long as the error rate is within the design range of the codes applied, but they seem to perform poorly for video transmission over wireless links <ref> [26] </ref>. Some of their drawbacks are the following. First, it is impractical to correct all errors, therefore they cannot be considered by themselves complete solutions, particularly for wireless networks which are highly noisy. Second, FEC introduces considerable overhead in bit rate.

Reference-contexts: III. Transport Architecture for MLC Media The advantages of LC are best exploited when the networking architectures support differential treatment of traffic. Even though priorities and labeling for different types of traffic have been a part of the Internetworking Protocol (IP) since its original design <ref> [27] </ref>, they have seldom been implemented in network system software or used in production mode on the Internet. The situation has been similar for most other wide-area networks. Local Area Network (LAN) specifications, notably FDDI, have been at the fore front of supporting priorities and Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. <p> Explicit flows, on the other hand, are included in the specification for the next generation of IP (IPv6), through a new IP packet format <ref> [27] </ref>, [31]. In addition, a new priority structure, potential support for reservations and QoS guarantees, etc., are introduced with IPv6 and related technologies such as RSVP [32] and others. 10 HAN & POLYZOS IV.

Reference-contexts: The traditional mapping of LC to ATM service has been through the use of the Cell Loss Priority (CLP) bit in the ATM cell header, as defined in the ATM specification (e.g., see <ref> [28] </ref>). ATM switches that experience congestion are expected to first drop cells that have the CLP bit set. This action should relieve congestion and thus protect cells that have not been designated as candidates for dropping.

Reference-contexts: Note that the demultiplexing cost for receiving multiple VCs arriving at a receiver (as opposed to the signal processing cost for synthesizing the final presentation signal from its components) is minimal based on our experimental findings reported in <ref> [29] </ref>. B. Internet Similar techniques can be applied in IP networks. The current IP specification (IPv4) has two (related) mechanisms that can be used for traffic labeling and prioritization: the type-of-service field and an explicit priority field that allows eight levels of priority to be specified.

However, errors in the base layer cannot be effectively concealed in the absence of a reference picture and accurate motion vectors. A simple zero or mean substitution will not be effective for a damaged base layer <ref> [36] </ref>. Further, in the case of hierarchical coding with variable spatial resolutions, these techniques usually aggravate the situation. B. Decoder Resynchronization With variable length coding, loss of even a single packet can lead to loss of decoder synchronization, which can damage an image catastrophically.

Reference-contexts: However, an increased bit rate follows due to the lower coding gain resulting from the less precise prediction values of this approach. A 8%-15% overhead is reported in [36]. In interframe coded video, the use of motion vectors for concealing errors is common <ref> [37] </ref>, [38]. This approach can be very effective when the estimation of motion in subsequent frames can be achieved accurately. Thus, one of the standard assumptions used in the literature is that motion vectors will be delivered error-free.

Reference-contexts: Each MLC image is obtained by aggregating differential layers with neutral gray background. C.1 Error Performance of MLC with Unequal Protection Levels For our experiments described here we use the luminance components (only) of the following two image sequences: Football <ref> [39] </ref>, in almost CIF resolution (360 fi 243 for luminance), and Salesman [40], in CIF standard resolution (352 fi 288 for luminance). Each test sequence has 80 frames and is coded with the HJPEG coder we have implemented [10].
