Title: trading function in action  
Author: Bruce Jacob and Trevor Mudge 
Address: Michigan  
Affiliation: Advanced Computer Architecture Lab EECS Department, University of  
Abstract: This paper describes a commercial software and hardware platform for telecommunications and multimedia processing. The software architecture loosely follows the CORBA and ODP standards of distributed computing and supports a number of application types on different hardware configurations. This paper is the result of lessons learned in the process of designing, building, and modifying an industrial telecommunications platform. In particular, the use of the trading function in the design of the system led to such benefits as support for the dynamic evolution of the system, the ability to dynamically add services and data types to a running system, support for heterogeneous systems, and a simple design performing well enough to handle traffic in excess of 40,000 busy-hour calls.

Reference-contexts: An object requiring a service therefore requests the print service or the fax service. Requests go to the central trader , where they are inserted into a timeout queue similar to the callout table in Unix <ref> [Bach86] </ref>. Thus, an object needing a particular service only needs to know the name of the service, the interface of the service, and the address of the trader. Fig 2 illustrates the primary components of the software architecture at a lower level of abstraction.

Reference-contexts: Implemented systems include RPC systems such as the Distributed Computing Environment from OSF [OSF91], the Information Bus [Oki93], and Birrells Network Objects <ref> [Birrell93] </ref>. DCE assigns unique ids to service interfaces and requires a client to program for the interface and include the interface description at compile time. A client must know either a servers authentication id or a shared location in the CDS namespace before attempting to bind.

Reference-contexts: A client receives all information on the network of the types to which the client subscribes. Birrells network objects are similar to other distributed object systems such as Opal <ref> [Chase92] </ref> and Emerald [Jul88], but simplify the designs by restricting mobility and copy nonstationary objects over the network by pickling. Objects export their methods under whatever name they desire, so it is possible for a client object to find a server object by a descriptive name.

Reference-contexts: Software design Fig 1 illustrates the software architecture at a high level of abstraction. It is an example of the active object model , using a popular taxonomy <ref> [Chin88] </ref>. The system is made up of numerous interacting objects, each of which is a collection of methods bound to service names. The service names are globally visible, and advertised through a central point.

Reference-contexts: The software architecture of the system loosely follows the CORBA and ODP standards of distributed computing <ref> [OMG93, ITU92] </ref> and supports a number of applications on many hardware organizations. The system is organized around the principle of the ODP trading function. <p> By contrast, support for an Internet connection is nonobvious; sev eral years ago few could have predicted the rapid commercial rush to the Internet and the WorldWide Web. The trading function of the CCITT ODP Recommendation <ref> [ITU92, ITU94] </ref> is a simple concept that indirectly addresses these concerns. In the trading function, a trader acts as a yellow pages directory for services. Server objects that wish to offer services advertise, or export , their capabilities to the trader. <p> CORBA [OMG93] from the Object Management Group describes the use of objects, including standard definition languages and methods for storing and retrieving the interfaces. CORBA allows objects to invoke methods indirectly through the Object Request Broker, which can translate between client and server protocols. ODP <ref> [ITU92, ITU94] </ref> from CCITT (now ITU, the International Telecommunication Union) describes the trading function in which servers export service offers to a trader and clients import those offers.
