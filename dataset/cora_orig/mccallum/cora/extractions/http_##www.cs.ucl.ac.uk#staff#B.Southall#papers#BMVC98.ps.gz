Abstract: Kalman's optimum linear filter has proved to be immensely popular in the field of computer vision. A less often quoted contribution of Kalman's to the control theory literature is that of the concepts of controllability and observability which may be used to analyse the state transition and observation equations and give insights into the filter's viability. This paper aims to highlight the usefulness of these two ideas during the design stage of the filter and, as well as presenting the standard solutions for linear systems, uses a practical vision application (that of tracking plants for an autonomous crop protection vehicle) to illustrate a useful special case where these methods may be applied to a non-linear system. The application of tests for controllability and observability to the practical non-linear system give not only confirmation that the filter will be able to produce stable estimates, but also gives a lower bound on the number of features required from each image for it to do so.

Reference-contexts: state estimates, but they also give a lower bound on the number of observed features required from each image of a sequence. 2 Controllability and observability in linear systems The definitions and results given here for controllability and observability of linear systems may be found in any standard textbook, e.g. <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. <p> Proofs for both cases may be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> observability is given by: A system with state vector x of dimension n is observable if the observability matrix O = 6 6 6 6 4 HA HA i HA n1 7 7 7 7 5 has row rank n (i.e. n linearly independent rows) The proof of this test <ref> [4] </ref> uses (1) and (2) to determine the value of z (k) for 0 k n 1 in terms of x (0) and the known control inputs u (k) during that time period. <p> It is then straightforward to show that x (0) can be completely determined (and is therefore observable) if the matrix O has full row rank. A test for observability between time steps k 0 and k 1 for linear time varying systems may be found in <ref> [4] </ref> (and relates to the rank of the matrix H (k)(k; k 0 )). 3 Implications for Kalman filtering The above tests for controllability may be applied to stochastic systems which provide the Kalman filter prediction and observation equations: x (k + 1) = Ax (k) + Bu (k) + Vv

Reference-contexts: Although such an approach may at first seem a little curious, there is sometimes good reason to allow the variance of an estimate to collapse to zero. In <ref> [8] </ref> the mean of a process is estimated; clearly a mean is a single, fixed quantity which does not vary with time.

Reference-contexts: The extended Kalman filter described below is based upon that in <ref> [9] </ref>, but has been altered to address some of the problems highlighted in that work. The system model is illustrated and the controllability and observability of the system is discussed. <p> It should be noted that the plant centres are assumed to be on the ground plane (z w = 0). It is stressed that the model describes the grid on which individual plants should lie, rather than the actual location of the individual plants. In <ref> [9] </ref>, the quantities estimated by the Kalman filter are t x , Y and , whilst the model parameters r and l are assumed fixed (the imperfect plant positioning British Machine Vision Conference 7 being somewhat inappropriately modelled as observation noise). <p> The middle trace shows the state estimate, the upper and lower traces showing the estimate 2 standard deviations. Left: controllable system output. Right: uncontrollable system output. 4.4 Observability in a non-linear system The system described above is observed as plant centres in a perspective image <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> However, in this application, where there is one state prediction (prior) for a set of many features, it is possible to incorporate all the measurements in parallel, as in <ref> [9] </ref>, where the features observed in each image are incorporated simultaneously in batches.

This perspective projection leads (by using (12) and (13) with the imaging model of Tsai <ref> [10] </ref>) to the following non-linear observation system: z (k; m; n) = h [k; x (k); m; n; w (k)] = x f (x (k); m; n) where (x f ; y f ) is the image position in pixels of a plant centre on the ground plane: x f (x;

In [11], where the covariance matrix is used to provide partial constraints on aligning patches of range data, it is noted that in certain degenerate cases there are problems with their algorithm, although this is not named as a controllability problem.
