Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION TO EASE-GRID A task fundamental to advancing global change research is the availability of a standard reference system for direct digital comparison and interuse of remote sensing data sets on varying spatial and temporal scales <ref> [1] </ref>. The availability of a standard gridding scheme is an essential requirement for systematic time-series studies.

Reference-contexts: SSM/I EASE-GRID PROCESSING EASE-Grid images represent spatially interpolated data. For SSM/I data, the interpolation technique maximizes the radiometric integrity of original brightness temperature values, maintains high spatial and temporal precision, and involves no averaging of original swath data. Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation <ref> [2] </ref> is used to artificially increase (16 times) the density of brightness temperature measurements in the satellite swath reference frame (sample interval of 25.0 km for 19, 22, and 37 GHz, and 12.5 km for 85 GHz).

Reference-contexts: Overlapping orbit data are separately retained for the highest possible temporal resolution, and data for specific pixels can be extracted. The modular processor also simplifies testing of alternative resampling and gridding algorithms. The EASE-Grid is a standard gridding scheme now used with a variety of satellite datasets <ref> [3] </ref>, including SSM/I data, its original application. Although the specific method used to interpolate from native sensor coordinates to a fixed earth grid is unique to each sensor, the fundamental projection and grid-ding concept of the EASE-Grid provides the basis for a standard interuse gridding method.

Galantowicz and A.W. </author> <title> England, The Michigan Earth Grid: Description, Registration Method for SSM/I Data and Derivative Map Projections, </title> <type> Technical Report 027396-2-T, </type> <institution> Radiation Laboratory, University of Michi-gan, </institution> <address> Ann Arbor, MI, </address> <year> 1991. </year>
Reference-contexts: This method is based on the earlier work of Galantowicz and England <ref> [4] </ref> and Poe [8]. The brightness temperature for a given EASE-Grid cell is obtained from the oversampled array by the nearest neighbor method. No averaging of original swath data is employed (e.g., no drop-in-the-bucket). The Backus-Gilbert technique also allows resolution enhancement, but with a noise penalty.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the SSM/I EASE-Grid is composed of two fundamental parts: 1) a grid and projection scheme <ref> [5] </ref> and, 2) a specific method to interpolate SSM/I data from swath space to earth gridded coordinates. The projection and gridding scheme is independent of the satellite sensor or data type.

Reference-contexts: Automatic processing of thousands of files is possible. 4.1. Pre-EASE-Grid Processing The first phase consists primarily of filters and data validation. Three programs supplied with our data tapes ssmitdrlatlon, ss-mitdrta, ssmitdrtb <ref> [6] </ref> were used to spatially subset and convert the binary TDR files into ASCII Brightness Temperature (Tb) files (henceforth referred to as TDR files). orbit strip converts multi-orbit TDR files into multiple partial-orbit TDR files by splitting the data on the boundaries between ascending and descending scans.

Reference-contexts: PROCESSOR DESCRIPTION In this section, we provide an overview of the custom processor's operation. A major principle underlying our solution was to make the EASE-Grid processing easier to customize. Our approach was to encapsulate EASE-Grid functionality and to design modular extensions <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the starting point for the EASE-Grid processing for the standard CD-ROM product is so-called Wentz format data from Remote Sensing Systems, Inc. <ref> [9] </ref>. Alternative sources of SSM/I swath data exist. Data in TDR format can be obtained easily and at low cost for small quantities from the National Climatic Data Center, the Global Hydrology Resource Center (Huntsville, AL), and the National Geophysical Data Center.
