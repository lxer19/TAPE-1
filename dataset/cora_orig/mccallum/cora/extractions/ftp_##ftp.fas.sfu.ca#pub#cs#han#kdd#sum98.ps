Abstract: Our work has been focused on the integration of data mining and OLAP technologies and the development of scalable, integrated, and multiple data mining functions. A data mining system, DBMiner, has been developed for interactive mining of multiple-level knowledge in large relational databases and data warehouses. The system implements a wide spectrum of data mining functions, including characterization, comparison, association, classification, prediction, and clustering. It also builds up a user-friendly, interactive data mining environment and a set of knowledge visualization tools. In-depth research has been performed on the efficiency and scalability of data mining methods. Moreover, the research has been extended to spatial data mining, multimedia data mining, text mining, and Web mining with several new data mining system prototypes constructed or under construction, including GeoMiner, MultiMediaMiner, and WebLogMiner. This article summarizes our research and development activities in the last several years and shares our experiences and lessons with the readers.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The research into data mining in our lab started in early 1989, when we proposed an efficient knowledge discovery method, attribute-oriented induction <ref> [4] </ref>. Since then, we have investigated a set of interesting data mining methods for mining relational data, data warehouse data, spatial data, data formed with complex objects, text data, and multimedia data.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we summarize our study and point out some future research directions in Section 5. 2 OLAP + Data Mining ! On-Line Analytical Mining On-line analytical processing (OLAP) is a powerful data analysis method for multi-dimensional analysis of data 1 warehouses <ref> [5] </ref>. Motivated by the popularity of OLAP technology, we develop an OnLine Analytical Mining (OLAM) mechanism for multi-dimensional data mining in large databases and data warehouses. We believe this is a promising direction to pursue based on the following observations. 1. <p> There have been many studies on 2 efficient computation and access of multidimensional databases, such as <ref> [1, 5, 33] </ref>. Our early development of attribute-oriented induction method [13] adopts two generalization techniques: (1) attribute removal, which removes attributes which represent low-level data in a hierarchy, and (2) attribute generalization, which generalizes attribute values to their corresponding high level ones. <p> A spatial data cube [21] consists of both spatial and nonspatial dimensions and/or measures and can be modeled by the star or snowflake schema, resembling its relational counterpart <ref> [5] </ref>. Since a spatial measure may represent a group of aggregated spatial objects, whereas multi-dimensional spatial aggregation may produce a great number of such aggregated spatial objects, it is impossible to precompute and store all of such spatial aggregations. <p> Therefore, selective materialization of aggregated spatial objects is a reasonable tradeoff between storage space and on-line computation time. A method for selective materialization of spatial objects in spatial data cube computation is studied in <ref> [5] </ref>. Spatial data mining can be performed in a spatial data cube as well as in a spatial database. A spatial OLAP and spatial data mining system prototype, GeoMiner, is constructed based on our studies.

Similar heuristics and some additional techniques can be applied to parallel and/or distributed mining of association rules so that locally large itemsets can be mined in each partition, and with minimal message passing, one may compute the globally large itemsets without redistributing data to different sites.

Reference-contexts: We believe this is a promising direction to pursue based on the following observations. 1. Most data mining tools need to work on integrated, consistent, and cleaned data, which requires costly data cleaning, data transformation, and data integration as preprocessing steps <ref> [9] </ref>. A data warehouse constructed by such preprocessing serves as a valuable source of cleaned and integrated data for OLAP as well as for data mining. 2. Effective data mining needs exploratory data analysis.

For user-specified given period, such as per day, per week, per quarter, etc., the potential activity patterns can be aggregated with respect to the given period along the time dimension in a data cube. <p> For mining periodic patterns with arbitrary periods, similar OLAP-based methods can apply with the augmentation of some cycle merging properties. Notice also with OLAP-based cube manipulation, one can drill-down, roll-up, slice and dice the time-related cuboids to find such periodicity patterns on-the-fly. A detailed study is presented in <ref> [11] </ref>. 3.5 Wavelet technique for similarity-based time-series analysis Similarity-based time-series analysis is to find similar time-related patterns (trends, segments, etc.) in a large time-series database, such as stock market database. Traditional trend analysis techniques, such as Fourier transformation, are adopted in most previous analyses of similarity-based time-series [2].

For example, instead of presenting bulky answers, one can present a summary of answers and allow users to manipulate such a summary by drilling or dicing. One can present related answers or rules in the form of 8 associations or correlations based on association mining results.

Reference-contexts: Data level analysis, i.e., the analysis of database contents, should be taken into serious consideration. With generalization-based data mining, a multi-layer database model can be constructed by utilizing some common data access API and generalizing database contents from primitive level to multiple, higher levels <ref> [19] </ref>. A set of mutually related, generalized databases form a multi-layer database. Such a multi-layer database not only provides a useful architecture for intelligent query answering but also helps information exchange and interoperability among heterogeneous databases. <p> This is because the low-level heterogeneous data can be transformed into high-level, relatively homogeneous information which can be used for effective communication and query/information transformation among multiple databases. Methods for construction and maintenance of multiple-layer databases and for information exchange among heterogeneous databases are studied in <ref> [19] </ref>. 4 Towards On-Line Analytical Mining of Complex Types of Data It is challenging to extend the on-line analytical mining method to complex types of data, such as complex data objects, spatial data, text and multimedia data and Web-based data.

Reference-contexts: A generalization-based data mining method is proposed which generalizes complex objects, constructs a multi-dimensional object cube, and performs analytical mining in such an object cube <ref> [20] </ref>. Notice that objects with complex structures can be generalized to high-level data with relatively simple structures. For example, an object identifier can be generalized to the class identifier of the lowest class where the object resides.

A data cube-based clustering analyzer must effectively deal with large amount and high dimensionality of data and find interesting clusters. Moreover, most of the existing data clustering methods can only handle numeric data or cannot produce good quality results in the case where categorical domains are present.

Some foundational issues of constrained association mining are examined systematically in <ref> [27] </ref> by putting a rich set of constraint constructs, including domain, class, and SQL-style aggregate constraints into the same framework and discovering two properties of constraints that are critical to pruning: anti-monotonicity and succinctness. <p> A systematic study on what kinds of constraints are anti-monotonic and/or succinct is performed in <ref> [27] </ref> which also presents an efficient algorithm for constraint pushing. 3.4 Mining periodicity patterns Many patterns are periodic or approximately periodic in nature, e.g., seasons change periodically by year, temperatures change periodically by day, etc.

Reference-contexts: This distribution allows the user to view, for each class, the predicted probability that the object can belong to that class. There have been many classification methods studied, including decision-tree methods, such as ID-3 and C4.5 <ref> [28] </ref>, statistical methods, neural networks, rough sets, as well as some recently proposed database-oriented classification methods [25]. <p> Attribute relevance analysis is performed based on the analysis of an uncertainty measurement, a measurement which determines how much an attribute is in relevance to the class attribute. Other measurements, such as entropy-based information gain <ref> [28] </ref> and Gini index [25], can be used for relevance analysis as well. Several topmost relevant attributes are retained for classification analysis; whereas the weakly or irrelevant attributes are not considered in the subsequent classification process.

Reference-contexts: There have been many studies on mining association rules in transaction databases <ref> [3, 29, 15] </ref>. Data cube offers additional flexibility and efficiency in association rule mining. Two kinds of associations can be mined in a data cube: inter-dimension association and intra-dimension association.

With the popular adoption of wavelet transformation and analysis methods, we examine the wavelet transformation-based similarity mining methods for discovery of trends and/or similar curves or curve segments <ref> [30] </ref>. Template segments can be specified by users based on the given curve segments or using template primitives. Then wavelet transformation techniques can be used for curve smoothing and approximation, scaling, and translation, and then fragment-based pattern matching analysis.

Reference-contexts: Clustering analysis has many interesting applications. For example, it can be used to help marketers discover distinct groups in their customer bases and develop targeted marketing programs.

Reference-contexts: There have been many studies on 2 efficient computation and access of multidimensional databases, such as <ref> [1, 5, 33] </ref>. Our early development of attribute-oriented induction method [13] adopts two generalization techniques: (1) attribute removal, which removes attributes which represent low-level data in a hierarchy, and (2) attribute generalization, which generalizes attribute values to their corresponding high level ones. <p> The cube is precomputed using a chunk-based multiway array aggregation technique similar to <ref> [33] </ref>. However, when the cube has a large number of dimensions, it becomes very sparse with a huge number of chunks. In this case, a relational structure is adopted to store and compute the data cube, similar to the ROLAP implementation.
