Abstract: Twenty years ago anarchy threatened floating-point arithmetic. Over a dozen commercially significant arithmetics boasted diverse wordsizes, precisions, rounding procedures and over/underflow behaviors, and more were in the works. Portable software intended to reconcile that numerical diversity had become unbearably costly to develop. Ten years ago, when IEEE 754 became official, major microprocessor manufacturers had already adopted it despite the challenge it posed to implementors. With unprecedented altruism, hardware designers rose to its challenge in the belief that they would ease and encourage a vast burgeoning of numerical software. They did succeed to a considerable extent. Anyway, rounding anomalies that preoccupied all of us in the 1970s afflict only CRAYs now. Now atrophy threatens features of IEEE 754 caught in a vicious circle: Those features lack support in programming languages and compilers, so those features are mishandled and/or practically unusable, so those features are little known and less in demand, and so those features lack support in programming languages and compilers. To help break that circle, those features are discussed in these notes under the following headings: Insofar as this is a status report, it is subject to change and supersedes versions with earlier dates. This version supersedes one distributed at a panel discussion of Floating-Point Past, Present and Future in a series of San Francisco Bay Area Computer History Perspectives sponsored by Sun Microsystems Inc. in May 1995.
