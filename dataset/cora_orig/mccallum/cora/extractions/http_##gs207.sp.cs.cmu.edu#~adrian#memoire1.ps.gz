Abstract: This document presents the advantages, but also the problems and dangers associated with a possible introduction of digital cash. After a brief review of the history of the monetary system in use today and a short introduction to cryptography, the key elements that should be considered when designing a digital cash system are discussed. The various attempts which are already practiced today and those which are currently in development are carefully analysed, highlighting their weaknesses and strengths. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of electronic monetary systems are discussed.

The goal of ecash was to provide an anonymous, on-line digital money scheme that was easy to implement and to use. Implementation RSA (public key) cryptography is the basis of the ecash security. <p> DigiCash currently follows a non-exclusive licensing policy, allowing multiple parties to issue ecash with their own, competitive, pricing structure. Until this moment, ecash does not yet support Off-line capabilities or divisible coins. In <ref> [CFN88] </ref>, David Chaum presented ideas to have Off-line capable coins and divisible electronic money. We can expect in the future that ecash will be extended to implement these properties as well. Critique Ecash is at the moment the only payment scheme which is truly anonymous.

Reference-contexts: What if the chosen cryptographic algorithm is not safe? Most algorithms used in these monetary systems have been around for many years already (DES <ref> [DP92] </ref>, RSA [RSA78]), and some of the best cryptology experts tried to break them using sophisticated methods without success. Although one can never exclude the possibility that someone invents a new brilliant way to attack a given algorithm, chances that this might happen are still very small.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this scheme is not anonymous, as it relies on credit card transactions. 6.5 First Virtual Desired Properties and Design Goals FIRST VIRTUAL (FV) uses a very different approach to digital money. No encryption techniques are used. FV writes <ref> [Vir95] </ref>: With FV, encryption isn't needed. Encryption is almost always cumbersome and difficult. And it always adds an additional step, and something else to worry about. Rather than use encryption, we decided to design a system in which it wouldn't be necessary.

Reference-contexts: The fees for digital cash transactions are likely to be smaller than for today's cards because of smaller operating costs for the issuer. 12 In 1993, card fraud cost English banks about 130 million pounds <ref> [WCP + 95] </ref>. Projet STS Jorg Kienzle and Adrian Perrig 32 Disadvantages of Digital Money There would also be less vandalism, since with infrared interfaces, there are no slots or contacts. Ticket vending machines could use electronic receipts rather than printers. This would reduce maintenance costs.
