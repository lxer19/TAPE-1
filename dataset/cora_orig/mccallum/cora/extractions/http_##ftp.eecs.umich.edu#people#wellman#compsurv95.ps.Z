Abstract: To take an economic approach to anything typically invokes three premises. First, that the fundamental problem to be solved is one of resource allocation. Second, that it is useful to model behavior in terms of a rationality abstraction. And third, that it is essential to consider how authority and activity may be decentralized. All three of these premises are being increasingly adopted (explicitly or implicitly) in artificial intelligence, and growing numbers of AI researchers are working within the economic paradigm. Computer scientists like to view a program as an abstract specification of a machine, describable behaviorally in terms of the input/output relationship resulting from its computation. The machines product is its output, representing the value of a function at the point represented by its input. Often we find it helpful to view this product at a higher level, say, as the solution to some well-posed problem. Inevitably, this problem bears on what we are to do, that is, some course of action to be embarked upon. (Conceptions of computation as answering questions are a relic of the era when human intermediaries were necessary to perform the transduction from computation to action.) In this view, the computer is a decision machine, where a decision is the resolution of a distinction among potential courses of action. Without loss of generality, every decisionhence every computation (Doyle, 1992)is really about resource allocation. Choosing to do something entails an allocation of attention and other activity resources to that thing in lieu of others. Conversely, an allocation of resources defines the activities done and not done. Making such choices appropriately involves weighing the benefits of the activities done against the opportunity cost of forgoing those not done. So far, we have only tautologies. Sure, every problem can be cast as one of resource allocation, but what is the concomitant advantage? The answer is that without considering resources explicitly, it is difficult to express the range of courses of action available, as defined by configurations of resources devoted to the various activities. Perhaps even more seriously, without
