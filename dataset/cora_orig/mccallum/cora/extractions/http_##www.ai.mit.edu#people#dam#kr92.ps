Abstract: New Results on Local Inference Relations Abstract We consider the concept of a local set of inference rules. A local rule set can be automatically transformed into a rule set for which bottom up evaluation terminates in polynomial time. The local rule set transformation gives polynomial time evaluation strategies for a large variety of rule sets that can not be given terminating evaluation strategies by any other known automatic technique. This paper discusses three new results. First, it is shown that every polynomial time predicate can be defined by an (unstratified) local rule set. Second, a new machine recognizable subclass of the local rule sets is identified. Finally we show that locality, as a property of rule sets, is undecidable in general. This paper appeared in KR-92.

Reference-contexts: The process for generating feedback templates is defined as a ground process | it only deals with ground instances of clauses in R. The ground process can be "lifted" using a lifting transformation. Since lifting is largely mechanical for arbitrary ground procedures <ref> [ McAllester and Siskind, 1991 ] </ref> , the lifting operation is only discussed briefly here. <p> Lifting can be formalized as a mechanical operation on arbitrary nondeterministic ground procedures <ref> [ McAllester and Siskind, 1991 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Clearly, if ` R then ` R . But the converse does not hold in general. By definition, if the converse holds then R is local. Definition ( <ref> [ McAllester, 1993 ] </ref> ): The rule set R is local if the restricted inference relation ` R is the same as the unrestricted relation ` R . <p> 0 to be the rule set containing the following clauses. * Input 0 (x 1 ; : : : x k ; x 1 ; : : : x k ) 3 An analysis of the order of running time for decision procedures for local inference relations is given in <ref> [ McAllester, 1993 ] </ref> . 11 * All clauses of the form Q 0 Q 0 W 0 (x 1 ; : : : x k ; s 1 ; : : : s j ) where the clause Q 1 (t 1;1 ; : : : t 1;m 1 )^ <p> This implies ` R 0 . 5 ANOTHER CHARACTERIZATION OF LO CALITY In this section we give an alternate characterization of locality. This characterization of locality plays an important role in both the definition of bounded local rule sets given in <ref> [ McAllester, 1993 ] </ref> and in the notion of inductively local rule sets given here. Definition: A bounding set is a set of ground terms such that every subterm of a member of is also a member of . <p> By abuse of notation, a feedback event will be written as ` R;[fffg . Lemma ( <ref> [ McAllester, 1993 ] </ref> ): R is local if and only if there are no feedback events for R. Proof: First note that if R has a feedback event then R is not local | if ` R;[fffg then ` R but if 6` R; then 6` R .
