Definition 4.11 Strong confluence <ref> [Hue80] </ref> A relation ! is strongly confluent (SCR) if ; ! ! = ; (see Figure 2). Informally, the tiler can choose the side of the splitting. Although a direct proof that strong confluence implies confluence is easy, we want to reduce this problem to Theorem 4.6. <p> The solution is to make a distinction between vertical and horizontal reductions and to order horizontal steps above vertical ones. 11 2 2 1 Requests = = Corollary 4.12 Strong confluence lemma <ref> [Hue80] </ref> Let A = def (A; !) be an ARS. If A is strongly confluent, then A is confluent. Proof Define the ARS B = def (A; h ! h ; ! v i ) by ! h = def ! v = def !.

Reference-contexts: A typical way to check confluence is to investigate in which way computation steps interact. A number of criteria sufficient for confluence can already be stated on the level of abstract reduction systems (see Klop <ref> [Klo91] </ref>). Many of these criteria are in fact local confluence constraints, i.e. they put constraints on the converging reduction sequences needed to reach a common result after two diverging computation steps (see for example Figure 2).
