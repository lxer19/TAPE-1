Reference-contexts: In the later sections of this document, the learning capabilities and cognitive aspects of Soar are described. This document is not intended to serve as a reference for Soar. Instead, it is meant as a companion to the manual <ref> [Congdon1996] </ref>. We will suggest ways to explore Soar and new things to try. We strongly encourage you to make heavy use of the manual to find out different parameters for the various commands, and to find out new things that you can do with them. <p> After the problem solving aspects of Soar are described, we will introduce the practical aspects of learning and cognitive modeling in Soar. For further information on these and other aspects of Soar, please see these helpful references <ref> [Congdon1996, Laird et al.1987, Newell1990] </ref>. Important note The coloring book assumes that you have version 7 of Soar.

Reference-contexts: These models then also include "submodels" of the operations that are involved in the activities of perception and action as well as cognitive processing. 10.2 The simulator Soar 7, the latest version of Soar, is now compatible with Tcl/Tk <ref> [Ousterhout1994] </ref>, greatly easing the development of graphical interfaces for Soar models. Figure 14 shows the interface for a blocks world simulator that we'll now use in this tutorial. The simulator contains a simulated gripper which travels around the world moving blocks with its suction cup grip. <p> If the task requires a large amount of user interaction, or if some sort of graphical display is appropriate, then tcl I/O should be used. Tcl, the task command language <ref> [Ousterhout1994] </ref>, extends the range of output possibilities in Soar. For example, Tk, the Tcl "took kit," provides a relatively simple way to create buttons, and menus, and graphical displays. The external interaction interface described in section 10 used tcl I/O. <p> It does not, however, describe tcl/TK. For information on this programming language, we refer you to <ref> [Ousterhout1994] </ref> and/or [Welch1995]. 17.2.1 Basic I/O The main advantage of doing I/O with tcl is that you have much greater control over the formatting of the output.
