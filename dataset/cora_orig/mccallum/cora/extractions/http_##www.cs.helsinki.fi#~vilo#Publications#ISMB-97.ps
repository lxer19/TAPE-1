Abstract: We have examined methods and developed a general software tool for finding and analyzing combinations of transcription factor binding sites that occur relatively often in gene upstream regions (putative promoter regions) in the yeast genome. Such frequently occurring combinations may be essential parts of possible promoter classes. The regions upstream to all genes were first isolated from the yeast genome database MIPS using the information in the annotation files of the database. The ones that do not overlap with coding regions were chosen for further studies. Next, all occurrences of the yeast transcription factor binding sites, as given in the IMD database, were located in the genome and in the selected regions in particular. Finally, by using a general purpose data mining software in combination with our own software, which parametrizes the search, we can find the combinations of binding sites that occur in the upstream regions more frequently than would be expected on the basis of the frequency of individual sites. The procedure also finds so-called association rules present in such combinations. The developed tool is available for use through the WWW.

Reference-contexts: The research aimed towards the analysis of the "second order" features of TRUs has been started only very recently. Several databases containing information about TRUs basically collected from the literature have been published: EPD <ref> (Bucher 1996) </ref>, COMPEL (Kel et al. 1995b), and TRRD (Kel et al. 1995a), but none of these databases contain a class of entries specifically for yeast.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a tool for the analysis of the upstream regions (of different length) of putative genes of the complete yeast genome taken from MIPS database (Goffeau et al. 1996) for all occurring combinations of transcription factor binding sites as given in Information Matrix Database <ref> (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995) </ref>. We are interested in finding combinations that occur relatively frequently in upstream regions and whose occurrence pattern in the genome is different from what might be statistically expected by chance. Such combinations may be parts of promoter classes. <p> Several algorithms have been presented for searching the given consensus sites in sequences (Frech, Herrmann, & Werner 1993; Prestridge 1991; Quandt et al. 1995), but an acknowledged problem in using these search algorithms is the high rate of false positives. As noted in <ref> (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995) </ref> some of the site sequences in the databases may be longer than the actual binding sites, while some others may be shorter. A list of known yeast proteins, which include the transcription factors, is given in MIPS database. <p> However, an easier electronic access to yeast transcription factor binding sites can be obtained through specialized transcription factor databases. Two transcription factor databases: TFD (Ghosh 1990) and TRANSFAC (Wingender 1994; Win-gender et al. 1996), and the transcription site information matrix database IMD <ref> (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995) </ref> are widely known. TFD database (release 7.5) contains 45 transcription factors and 179 site sequences of S.Cerevisiae. TRANSFAC database (release 3.0) contains 116 factor entries and 308 site entries with 279 site sequences for this organism. <p> TRANSFAC database (release 3.0) contains 116 factor entries and 308 site entries with 279 site sequences for this organism. Most of the site sequences are obtained by in vitro experiments, though there are also consensus patterns included. The Information Matrix Database IMD <ref> (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995) </ref> is a database containing the position weight matrices constructed from TFD and TRANSFAC as well as from the original references in the following way. <p> The matches by TFD sites gave similarly wide spectrum. This statistics supports the observations discussed in <ref> (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995) </ref> that these site entries have rather varying properties. Therefore for further research we decided to use the matrix representation of IMD database (release 1.0) and the related software MATRIX SEARCH 1.0 (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995). <p> This statistics supports the observations discussed in <ref> (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995) </ref> that these site entries have rather varying properties. Therefore for further research we decided to use the matrix representation of IMD database (release 1.0) and the related software MATRIX SEARCH 1.0 (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995). We run MATRIX SEARCH against the complete yeast genome and marked the positions of matches of each of the given 39 yeast transcription factor matrices. <p> This notion can be defined in various ways we use the definition from <ref> (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995) </ref>: t = i=1 M (ff [i]; i) + 0:01 where p (a) is the probability (the relative frequency) of the character a in the total sequence (or in the database).

Reference-contexts: In this paper we are trying to close this gap by using data mining techniques. Data mining is the most nontrivial step of an automated knowledge discovery process in databases. The task of data mining (see <ref> (Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro, & Smyth 1996) </ref>) is to extract potentially interesting, statistically unexpected phenomena from the data, and in this way to generate hypotheses for exploration by domain experts.

This gives enormous amount of information for the studies of how the genome as the whole is organized and how it functions. <p> Our work is aimed towards this goal. We have developed a tool for the analysis of the upstream regions (of different length) of putative genes of the complete yeast genome taken from MIPS database <ref> (Goffeau et al. 1996) </ref> for all occurring combinations of transcription factor binding sites as given in Information Matrix Database (Chen, Hertz, & Stormo 1995). <p> Finally, we will discuss the results and the possible future research directions. Background The information about the 16 chromosomes of S.Cerevisiae are publicly available in MIPS database <ref> (Goffeau et al. 1996) </ref>. MIPS database essentially contains two types of objects: the chromosome sequences, and their annotations providing the information, for instance, about the positions of the predicted genes. Totally 6275 open reading frames (ORFs) have been annotated. <p> Information Gathering and Preprocessing Phase Our aim was to develop a tool for finding the transcription factor binding site combinations that have high support, goodness and unexpectedness ratios in the yeast genome. We retrieved the sequences and annotations from MIPS <ref> (Goffeau et al. 1996) </ref> database (the latest update was done on January 29, 1997).

Reference-contexts: The union of all factors from TFD and TRANSFAC that have at least two binding site sequences has been taken, and a position weight matrix has been constructed for each such factor from the given binding sites by maximization of the information content <ref> (Hertz & Stormo 1994) </ref>. Totally there are 39 matrices for yeast factors. A program MATRIX SEARCH 1.0 for searching IMD matrices in a given sequence is also provided with the database. The research aimed towards the analysis of the "second order" features of TRUs has been started only very recently.

Reference-contexts: Note that implementing of data mining via storing precomputed information in a specially created database, and thus, effectively reducing later data mining to mere querying the new database has been proposed for instance in <ref> (Imielinski & Mannila 1996) </ref>. Knowledge Discovery Phase We developed a program Transcription Factor Combination Discoverer (TFCD) for extracting the combinations with specified parameters from the created files. The TFCD is implemented as a WWW site (http://www.cs.Helsinki.FI/~vilo/Yeast/) allowing queries via simple user interface on the Web.

Reference-contexts: The last category contains 390 ORFs, leaving 5885 ORFs as likely candidates for protein genes. It is widely assumed that in yeast TRUs rarely extend more than 1500 bp upstream from the coding region of a gene and is often contained within 500 bp <ref> (Mellor 1993) </ref>. By creating an appropriate software for parsing the annotations it is possible to extract all the sequences of a specified length upstream to all putative ORFs of a given level of confidence.

Reference-contexts: In general, for almost all lengths there is a slight preference of 5% to 10% of total occurrences of sites in upstream regions vs. random regions. Next we transformed the output of MATRIX SEARCH into the format that can be used by the data mining program of <ref> (Toivonen 1996) </ref> to find frequent combinations of sites present in upstream regions, and the association rules between these sites. (In principle a relatively straightforward enumeration of combinations is also possible, but it would be much less efficient and technically more difficult as using efficient general purpose software for this aim.
