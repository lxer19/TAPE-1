Reference-contexts: replacing it with a Null manager so that Netscape allows file access through Java applets. (Note that Java applets are not supposed to be able to read and write arbitrary files.) This can be done by changing a few bytes of Netscape's executable file with any sort of hex editor. <ref> [Back, 1996] </ref> Jumping firewalls with Java: Researchers at Princeton have discovered a serious security problem with Netscape Navigator's 2.0 Java implementation. (The problem is also present in the 1.0 release of the Java Development Kit from Sun.) A Java applet is normally allowed to connect only to the host from which

Reference-contexts: This section briefly describes some of the issues that we encountered while converting a C/C++ code coverage 4 See URL http://www.pure.com/products/pureperformix/index.html for more information. 4 tool for use on Java code. Our successful conversion resulted in the first code coverage tool suitable for use in testing Java applets <ref> [Binns and McGraw, 1996] </ref>. Many proficient C and C++ programmers find coming up to speed in Java a fairly straightforward task. However, these programmers have become accustomed to having a large set of development tools at their fingertips.

Reference-contexts: CGI security holes: CERT reports that a security vulnerability has been reported in example Common Gateway Interface (CGI) code, as provided with the NCSA httpd 1.5a-export and APACHE httpd 1.0.3 (and possibly previous distributions of both servers) <ref> [CERT, 1996] </ref>. The example code contains a library function that contains a vulnerability. As a result of this problem, a remote user may retrieve any world readable files, execute arbitrary commands, and create files on the server with the privileges of the httpd process that answers HTTP requests. <p> This may be used to compromise the http server and under certain configurations gain privileged access. Several workarounds are possible and are listed in the CERT Alert <ref> [CERT, 1996] </ref>. Major Java Security Hole: [Dean et al., 1996] The same researchers at Princeton who discovered the Firewall Jumping problem have discovered another serious security flaw in the Java programming language.

Also see the related CERT Alert document CA-96.05. </note>
Reference-contexts: The firewall will fail to defend against attacks on internal networks, because the attack originates behind the firewall. Netscape has made a patch available to cure this security problem <ref> [Dean et al., 1996] </ref>. CGI security holes: CERT reports that a security vulnerability has been reported in example Common Gateway Interface (CGI) code, as provided with the NCSA httpd 1.5a-export and APACHE httpd 1.0.3 (and possibly previous distributions of both servers) [CERT, 1996]. <p> This may be used to compromise the http server and under certain configurations gain privileged access. Several workarounds are possible and are listed in the CERT Alert [CERT, 1996]. Major Java Security Hole: <ref> [Dean et al., 1996] </ref> The same researchers at Princeton who discovered the Firewall Jumping problem have discovered another serious security flaw in the Java programming language. This one allows a malicious Java applet running under Netscape Navigator (version 2.0 or 2.01) to execute arbitrary machine code. <p> This one allows a malicious Java applet running under Netscape Navigator (version 2.0 or 2.01) to execute arbitrary machine code. Using this hole, they have implemented an applet that exploits the flaw to remove a file. No fix for this hole has been issued as of March 28, 1996 <ref> [Dean et al., 1996] </ref>. It is clear that security concerns for web-based products are legitimate, and are not just so many cries of "wolf". The existence of such holes points out a real need for some sort of automated security testing geared toward use on web products.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, Netscape's implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm was buggy. David Wagner of Berkeley discovered a mistake in Netscape's pseudo-random number generator that could be exploited to break the encryption. The Netscape encryption algorithm has since been patched <ref> [Levy, 1996] </ref>. 6 Bypassing Netscape's security manager: Godmar Back, a Computer Science student at the University of Utah, has published a webpage explaining how to circumvent Netscape's security manager.
