Abstract: The Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) is seeking a new information system to replace its legacy system for youth case management. The major goal of the new information system is to improve the process of juvenile case management, and thus deliver more effective services to youths, by better facilitating the tracking of case information and the production and handling of case-related documents. The primary challenge in designing the new system is to integrate optimally the appropriate components of existing processes, information, and documents. Our approach has shown that fostering user discussion and review of existing documents is extremely valuable in defining existing processes and information requirements, and effectively highlights areas where valuable process changes can be made and what system features are needed to support them. Subsequently linking user requirements for documents with innovative graphic user interface techniques can integrate diverse information for users and can affect additional positive changes to organizational processes.
