Abstract: Realization of autonomous behavior in mobile robots, using fuzzy logic control, requires formulation of rules which are collectively responsible for necessary levels of intelligence. Such a collection of rules can be conveniently decomposed and efficiently implemented as a hierarchy of fuzzy-behaviors. This article describes how this can be done using a behavior-based architecture. A behavior hierarchy and mechanisms of control decision-making are described. In addition, an approach to behavior coordination is described with emphasis on evolution of fuzzy coordination rules using the genetic programming (GP) paradigm. Both conventional GP and steady-state GP are applied to evolve a fuzzy-behavior for sensor-based goal-seeking. The usefulness of the behavior hierarchy, and partial design by GP, is evident in performance results of simulated autonomous navigation.

Reference-contexts: It can be thought of in ethological terms as a motivational tendency of the behavior. Fuzzy rules for coordination are formulated to include weighting consequents which modulate the DOAs of lower-level primitives. The DOA, ff j 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, of primitive behavior j is specified in the consequent of applicability rules of the form IF x is ~ A i T HEN ff j is ~ D i (2) 2 Time delays between Earth and Mars can be anywhere between 6 and 41 minutes. where as in (

Reference-contexts: This requires formulation of a large and complex set of fuzzy rules. In this situation a potential limitation to the utility of the monolithic fuzzy controller becomes apparent. Since the size of complete monolithic rule-bases increases exponentially with the number of input variables <ref> [2] </ref>, multi-input systems can potentially suffer degradations in real-time response. This is a critical issue for mobile robots operating in dynamic surroundings. Hierarchical rule structures can be employed to overcome this limitation such that the size of the rule-base increases linearly with the number of input variables [2, 3]. <p> This is a critical issue for mobile robots operating in dynamic surroundings. Hierarchical rule structures can be employed to overcome this limitation such that the size of the rule-base increases linearly with the number of input variables <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. This article describes a behavior-based robot navigation control system. Autonomy is achieved within a hierarchical structure of fuzzy-behaviors in which low-level navigation behaviors are realized as fuzzy logic controllers, while higher-level coordination behaviors are implemented as fuzzy decision systems. <p> When this occurs, the total number of rules to be consulted on a given control cycle is reduced. The reduction in rule evaluations is not as dramatic or static as in the strict rule hierarchies proposed in <ref> [2, 3] </ref> since we are dealing with a behavior hierarchy that achieves interacting goals. As such, the number of rules consulted during each control cycle varies dynamically as governed by the DOAs and thresholds of the behaviors involved.

The paradigm was initially proposed by Brooks <ref> [5] </ref> and realized as the `subsumption architecture' wherein a behavior system is implemented as distributed finite state automata. Until recently [6]-[8], most behavior controllers have been based on crisp (non-fuzzy) data processing and binary logic-based reasoning.

Reference-contexts: These forms of behavior are not perfectly distinct; they are extremes along a continuum <ref> [11] </ref>. Instances of behavior throughout the continuum can be realized using behavior modulation, which we define as the autonomous act of regulating, adjusting or adapting the activation level of a behavior to the proper degree in response to a context, situation, or state perceived by an autonomous agent.

Fuzzy rules of each applicable primitive behavior are processed yielding respective output fuzzy sets. These fuzzy sets are equivalent to the result produced by rule-base evaluation in conventional fuzzy controllers before applying the defuzzification operator.

Using this earlier work as a foundation, we apply our GP approach here to higher-level behavior coordination. 4 Genetic Programming of Fuzzy-behaviors The GP paradigm <ref> [20] </ref> computationally simulates the Darwinian evolution process by applying fitness-based selection and genetic operators to a population of parse trees representing computer programs of a given programming language. It departs from the conventional genetic algorithm primarily with regard to its representation scheme. <p> The GP system was run using population sizes of 10-20 rule-bases for a number of generations ranging from 10-15. In GP, genetic diversity remains high even for very small populations due to the tree structure of individuals <ref> [20] </ref>. Steady-state GP was also applied using a population size of 20. Results of runs using both approaches are summarized graphically in Figure 7.
