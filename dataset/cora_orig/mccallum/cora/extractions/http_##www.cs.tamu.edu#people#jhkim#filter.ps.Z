Abstract: This paper presents an approach for the fault tolerant computation of the rank order fi ltering on a SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) mesh processor, such as the MasPar. The proposed approach improves over a previous approach [ 12] in two respects: bychanging the data dependency in the execution of the rank order fi ltering, a new algorithmwith constantexecution time complexity can be designed; and by introducing a dependency for the rank values of faulty PEs as computed by neighboring (fault free) processing elements (PEs), a lower distortion can be achieved for enhancement of the image.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Image and signal processing have been widely advocated as possible application areas for parallel computationusing homogeneoussystems, such as the mesh and the hypercube <ref> [7, 14, 15] </ref>. However, the use of these systems in highly reliable applications as well as the difficulty in manufacturing a fully embedded system using high density and large areatechnologies, warrantthe use of defect/fault tolerant techniques [12, 17]. <p> These techniques have been implemented for yield enhancement as well as continued operation of the computing system in the presence of faults [12, 13, 16, 20]. A topology which has been successfully implemented in commercial parallel systems, is the two dimensional wraparound array, generally known as the toroidal mesh <ref> [7, 23, 24] </ref>. An example of a toroidal mesh is the MasPar [7].

It is also assumed that an Array Control Unit (ACU) is available; its two main functions are as follows: (1) send data to the array simultaneously, and (2) perform computation on singular data. <p> PEs (this scenario is rather restrictive as a large number of faulty PEs can realistically only happen at manufacturing time of the array). 7 Conclusions This paper has presented an improved parallel approach for computing the rank order filtering of an image on a SIMD mesh such as the MasPar <ref> [7] </ref>. An algorithm with a constant execution time has been proposed; this algorithm relies on anewdependency graph in the computation of the ranks in the filtering to improve considerably over a previous algorithm (with an execution complexity linearly dependent on the dimension of the mesh) [12].

The switch structure used in this paper is the same as in [12] (Figure 2), but it is different from the one in <ref> [13] </ref> because it lies directly on the PE-switch bus. 3 Review of previous work A rank order filter is classified as a window-based filtering method in which given a window of size L fi L for the pixel values, the kth rank of the windowcorresponds to the kth largestpixel value [3].
