Note: Appendix: Applying to the NSF Summer Institute in Japan  
Abstract: While the NSF Summer Institute in Japan program provides assistance in locating a host laboratory, the best host/student matches come when the student is involved in the lab selection process. The NSF requests applicants to provide a list of appropriate host laboratories; and applicants should not hesitate to approach potential hosts themselves. A major criteria in finding a match is proximity to Tokyo and Tsukuba, since that is where students are housed. Graduate students eligible for the Summer Institute must be US citizens or permanent residents. No prior knowledge of Japanese is required. The sponsors do not recommend that spouses or dependents come to Japan with program participants (NSF, 1994). The Institute is jointly administered by the NSF on the US side, and the STA (Science and Technology Agency, a division of MITI) on the Japanese side. Funding comes from NSF and NIH in the US. In Japan, the Center for Global Partnership (CGP) and Japan International Science and Technology Exchange Center (JISTEC) provide financial and logistical support. US funding covers students' travel costs to and from Japan, as well as an extra $2000 as compensation for income lost during the program's duration. Japanese funding covers room and board, costs of research travel, as well as several enjoyable cultural experiences. In my experience, the amount of money provided to each student is more than adequate. Interested students may request an application form electronically or by post. For contact information, see the contact list earlier in this report.
