Abstract: This paper describes a method for detecting and recognizing road signs in gray-level and color images acquired by a single camera mounted on a moving vehicle. The method works in three stages. First, the search for the road sign is reduced to a suitable region of the image by using some a priori knowledge on the scene or color clues (when available). Secondly, a geometrical analysis of the edges extracted from the image is carried out, which generates candidates to be circular and triangular signs. Thirdly, a recognition stage tests by cross-correlation techniques each candidate which, if validated, is classified according to the data-base of signs. An extensive experimentation has shown that the method is robust against low-level noise corrupting edge detection and contour following, and works for images of cluttered urban streets as well as country roads and highways. A further improvement on the detection and recognition scheme has been obtained by means

Reference-contexts: Thirdly, the recognition 12 procedure should present a good discriminative power at a low computational cost.

The algorithm can be outlined as follows. <p> The algorithm can be outlined as follows. First, the road sign is classified according to its outer shape, and then normalized to a size of 50 fi 50 pixels by linear interpolation of the gray levels.

FEX. This algorithm <ref> [9] </ref> works on edge contours, which are approximated by means of straight segments or circular arcs according to a three pass procedure which can be shortly described as follows. <p> In our application, the arcs extracted are processed to recover contours which, because of their size and shape, are apt to represent the boundary of a road sign. In spite of the good results of this algorithm on a number of synthetic and real edge maps referred in <ref> [9] </ref>, the edges extracted from images of outdoor scenes often lead to a segmentation which does not suit our purposes, because of the strong sensitivity of the algorithm upon the edge-linking stage. <p> The main result is that, on 27 images like that shown in Fig. 8B, all of the three methods yield a very small rate of successful detections, while on sharper images, like in Fig. 8A, the road signs are usually detected correctly. The algorithm FEX <ref> [9] </ref> provides a segmentation of the edge data in circular arcs and straight segments. (A) and (B) show the circular arcs extracted by FEX from the edges of Figs. 8 (C) and (D) respectively.

Reference-contexts: Suffice is to remind the fundamental equations that describe the behavior of the filter. We have used the deterministic counterpart of the Kalman-Bucy filtering, which may be called recursive least-squares estimation and well described in <ref> [26] </ref>. It leads to the same set of equations as its probabilistic analog, but does not require arbitrary assumptions on the probability density functions of the errors. In the following, all errors are therefore to be interpreted as maximum uncertainties. <p> Observe that the measurement equations are not linear in the state variables, so that the Kalman-filter framework cannot be adopted straightforwardly. An extended Kalman filter approach need be adopted, by linearizing the measurement equation around the predicted state <ref> [26] </ref>. Let us define ^ where ^ n1 is the Kalman state at time t n1 .
