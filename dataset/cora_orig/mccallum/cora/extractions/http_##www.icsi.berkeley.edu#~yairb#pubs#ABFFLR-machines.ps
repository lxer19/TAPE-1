Abstract: We deal with the problem of making capital investments in machines for manufacturing a product. Opportunities for investment occur over time, every such option consists of a capital cost for a new machine and a resulting productivity gain, i.e., a lower production cost for one unit of product. The goal is that of minimizing the total production and capital costs when future demand for the product being produced and investment opportunities are unknown. This can be viewed as a generalization of the ski-rental problem and related to the mortgage problem [3]. fl A preliminary version of this paper has appeared in the Proceedings of the 23rd International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP 96), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1099, Springer-Verlag, 1996, pp. 429-441.

Reference-contexts: Many financial problems require to take decisions without having knowledge, or having only partial knowledge, of future opportunities. Competitive analysis of financial problems has received an increasing attention during the last years, for instance for currency exchange problems <ref> [2] </ref> or asset allocation [5]. The problem considered in this paper is a generalization of one of the basic on-line problems, the ski-rental problem due to L. Rudolph (see [4]), a model for the well known practical problem "rent or buy?".

Reference-contexts: Another problem considered in this model in the past is the so-called mortgage problem <ref> [3] </ref>, where a fluctuating mortgage rate and associated re-financing charges lead to the question "re-finance or not?".

The ski-rental problem 2 can be stated as follows: you don't know in advance how many times you will go skiing; renting a pair of skis costs $r; to purchase your own pair costs $p.

Reference-contexts: non-convex setting only makes sense if machines appear over time and it is possible that a better machine (in terms of both capital cost and production 4 cost criteria) will appear later. 2.1 Performance Measures We measure the performance of an on-line algorithm for this problem by its competitive ratio <ref> [6] </ref>. Let be a sequence of offers of machines and orders of demand for units of the commodity to be produced.
