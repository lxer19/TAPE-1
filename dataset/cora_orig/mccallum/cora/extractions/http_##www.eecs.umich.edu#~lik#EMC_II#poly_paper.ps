Reference-contexts: As the integrated circuits industry continues its progress toward higher performance circuitry, circuit designers are pushing the minimum device feature sizes to smaller values. This has resulted in the placement of strict demands on the fabrication industry to successfully manufacture circuits with smaller line widths and thinner films <ref> [1] </ref>. Because of its widespread use for feature definition, control of reactive ion etching is of particular importance to this effort [2-6]. We are applying real-time feedback control (RTC) theory to reactive ion etch processes in an attempt to make them more robust [4, 7-9].

Reference-contexts: A number of optical reflection-based systems have been used as in-situ thin film thickness monitors. These include single wavelength reflectometers (SWR), single wavelength ellipsometers (SWE), spectroscopic ellipsometers (SE), spectroscopic reflectometers (SR), and optical emission interfer-ometers (OEI). The SWR and SWE systems have been employed by Stefani and Butler <ref> [3] </ref> and Mar-coux and Foo [12]. These systems provide both excellent S/N and the capability of acquiring data quickly when lasers are employed as sources of incident light. <p> Furthermore, current practical implementations of OEI are quasi-monochromatic and suffer from the same accuracy problems on multi-film stacks as SWE and SWR. SE systems have been used <ref> [2, 3, 5, 14-16] </ref> because of the wealth of information and TEM-level accuracy [17] that they are capable of providing. <p> In such cases, properties other than the thin film thickness and refractive index may affect the magnitude of the intensity reflected from the sample. This is the case with poly Si. As a consequence, much work has been done on determination of poly Si film thickness via interferometry <ref> [3, 6, 14, 16, 17] </ref>. It has been shown that the optical properties of the poly Si necessary for the film thickness determination are quite sensitive to the processing conditions during the poly Si deposition [11, 23].

Reference-contexts: However, measurement of the effectiveness of this control scheme and the possible eventual implementation of feedback from wafer measurements requires that high-speed wafer measurements be available from test wafers. Also, data acquired from high-speed, in-situ measurements can be very useful for process diagnostics, process optimization, and run-to-run control <ref> [10] </ref>. Controlling the amount of material etched is critical to most dry etch applications; therefore, our initial feedback control work has concentrated on etch rate stabilization. Our model etch problem is the etching of polycrystalline silicon (used for most modern VLSI MOSFET gates) over thin SiO 2 layers on Si.

Reference-contexts: These techniques will be discussed below. Films such as poly Si, however, pose a significant challenge for these techniques due to the variation in the refractive index with grain size (and thus with deposition and annealing conditions) and to the presence of surface roughness <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> It has been shown that the optical properties of the poly Si necessary for the film thickness determination are quite sensitive to the processing conditions during the poly Si deposition <ref> [11, 23] </ref>. We model our poly Si films by using a two layer approximation with the first layer being a bulk 8 poly Si layer and the second being a thin surface roughness layer.

These systems provide both excellent S/N and the capability of acquiring data quickly when lasers are employed as sources of incident light. However, these systems do not provide enough information in a single time step to determine the thicknesses of the films in a multi-film stack with high confidence. <p> The etch rate determined by the SR system was computed by taking a time derivative of the calculated thickness data. The etch rate for the SWR system was computed using the method discussed by Marcoux and Foo <ref> [12] </ref> and Wu, et. al.[24]. (We refer to this method as the peak-valley (P-V) subtraction method.) The results are shown in Figure 7. As can be seen from the plot, the two methods agree well.

Reference-contexts: Ex-situ, microscope-based SRs (such as Nanospecs, Tencor/Prometrics TF systems, Leitz MPV-SP, and others) are commonly used in the semiconductor industry for in-line film thickness measurements. SR has been previously applied to real-time process monitoring using relatively expensive spectroscopic array detectors for high-speed measurements <ref> [18] </ref>. Fortunately, the recent availability of 3 low cost, broad-band CCD spectrometers provides the opportunity to determine the real-time effect of the plasma on the wafer using high-speed spectroscopic reflectometry in many systems without the chamber modifications required for SE.

Reference-contexts: We use a non-linear least squares regression algorithm that is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method [22]. Generally, the optical model used is one which assumes quasi-ideal thin films. Such films are isotropic with optically smooth, parallel interfaces <ref> [19] </ref>. With quasi-ideal thin films, only the film thickness and optical constants (refractive index) affect the magnitude of the reflected intensity. And although the equations are non-linear with respect to the film thickness, the regression routines are efficient in determination of the thin film thicknesses.

Reference-contexts: To determine the film thickness, we need only to provide the regression algorithm with the raw reflectance data and appropriate optical models for the thin films of interest. We use a non-linear least squares regression algorithm that is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method <ref> [22] </ref>. Generally, the optical model used is one which assumes quasi-ideal thin films. Such films are isotropic with optically smooth, parallel interfaces [19]. With quasi-ideal thin films, only the film thickness and optical constants (refractive index) affect the magnitude of the reflected intensity.

Reference-contexts: Before proceeding to the final experiment, it should also be noted that we used general least squares smoothing on the etch rates presented in this paper. We smoothed <ref> [25] </ref> the data by fitting a second order polynomial to a sliding window of 7 1/2 seconds of data. This method of smoothing has a significant effect on the point-by-point etch rate through averaging away some of the etch rate noise.

Reference-contexts: When the thickness is differentiated these errors are propagated through to the etch rate. More work is being done on quantifying the etch rate noise and on determining the bandwidths for filters that can be used to attenuate this noise <ref> [26] </ref>. 15 Finally, we present results of an experiment that demonstrates one of the potential benefits of having a real-time wafer state monitor. Research is being done at the University of Michigan on reducing variance in the etch rate of poly Si during reactive ion etching [27].

Reference-contexts: Research is being done at the University of Michigan on reducing variance in the etch rate of poly Si during reactive ion etching <ref> [27] </ref>. The rationale is that if the individual processes that collectively dominate the etching can be controlled, then the variance in the etch rate itself can also be controlled. This experiment uses a CF 4 -based etch chemistry.
