Abstract: In this paper we present a parallel algorithm for finding a path through a maze. The algorithm has been designed to run on a multicomputer and uses the concept of a work pool to facilitate in the maze search process. The algorithm has been implemented on a network-of-workstations using Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) and Glenda. Our performance tests have shown favorable results when the task size is moderately large.
