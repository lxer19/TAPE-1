Abstract: Recently, a new standardized format has been defined for enhanced electronic mail messages on the Internet. This format, known as MIME, permits messages to include, in a standardized manner, non-ASCII text, images, audio, and a variety of other kinds of interesting data. The MIME effort was explicitly focused on requiring absolutely no changes at the message transport level. Because of this fact, MIME-format mail runs transparently on all known Internet or Internet-style mail systems. This means that those concerned solely with the maintenance and development of message transport services can safely ignore MIME completely, if they so choose. However, the fact that MIME can be ignored, for the purpose of message transport, does not necessarily mean that it should be ignored. In particular, MIME offers several features that should be of interest to those responsible for message transport services. By exploiting these features, transport systems can provide certain additional kinds of service that are currently unavailable, and can alleviate a few existing problems. The remainder of this document is an attempt to briefly point out and summarize some important ways in which MIME may be of use for message transport systems. This document makes no attempt to present a complete technical description of MIME, however. For that, the reader is refered to the MIME document itself [RFC-1341].
