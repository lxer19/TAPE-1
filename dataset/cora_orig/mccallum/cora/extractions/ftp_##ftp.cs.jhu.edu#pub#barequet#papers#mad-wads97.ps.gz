Abstract: In this paper we develop the concept of a polygon-offset distance function and show how to compute the respective nearest- and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams of point sites in the plane. We provide optimal deterministic O(n(log n + log m) + m)-time algorithms, where n is the number of points and m is the complexity of the underlying polygon, for computing compact representations of both diagrams.

Reference-contexts: They do not address furthest-neighbor diagrams, however, nor do they address the case when distance is defined by offsets of a convex polygon. Aichholzer and Aurenhammer present in <ref> [AA] </ref> an algorithm for constructing the so-called straight skeleton of a collection of polygonal chains, which identifies with the medial-axis of a convex polygon. They mention the use of the skeleton as a distance function and give a sketch [ibid., Figure 4] of a Voronoi diagram of two straight segments.

Reference-contexts: We, however, make the distinction between the convex polygon which defines the distance function and the set of points, sites in the diagram. Aichholzer et al. <ref> [AAAG] </ref> further study the properties and applications of the straight skeleton of a simple polygon.

Reference-contexts: He showed, for example, that distance can be defined in terms of a scaling of a convex polygon, and that while such functions do not in general define metrics, they exactly characterize the "distance" functions satisfying the triangle inequality. Chew and Drysdale <ref> [CD] </ref> show that one can define nearest-neighbor Voronoi diagrams using convex distance functions. They give an O (nm log n)- time method for constructing such diagrams for a set S of n points in the plane, with distance defined by a scaling of an m-edge convex polygon.

Reference-contexts: We apply the tentative prune-and-search paradigm of Kirkpatrick and Snoeyink [KS], as utilized by McAlister et al. [MKS], to the polygon-offset distance function. Like the method of McAlister et al., our nearest-neighbor diagram is based upon using this approach to design a non-trivial generalization of Fortune's plane-sweep algorithm <ref> [Fo] </ref>, whereas our furthest-neighbor diagram algorithm is based upon applying tentative prune-and-search to a generalization of Rappaport's space-sweeping algorithm [Ra]. 2 Preliminaries 2.1 Convex Polygon-Offset Distance Functions We first define the offset of a convex polygon. <p> We have followed the approach of [KMM] only for proving the properties of the Furthest-site Voronoi diagram. Our real goal is to obtain an optimal deterministic algorithm for computing the diagram. For this purpose we adopt the plane-sweep (in 3-space) approach of Rappaport [Ra] which follows Fortune's algorithm <ref> [Fo] </ref>, in which axis-parallel cones are emanating from the sites and the plane-sweep detects their intersections and produces the corresponding Voronoi vertices. The major detail that we need to note is that in our setting we have "polyhedral" cones whose intersection can be computed in O (log m) time.

Reference-contexts: Corollary 2. A polygon-offset distance function does not fulfill the triangle inequality. Minkowski <ref> [KN, p. 15, Theorem 2.3] </ref> proved that given a scaled distance function based on a shape S, the triangle inequality holds if and only if S is convex. 3 Nearest-Site Voronoi Diagram Let us now address the construction of a nearest-site Voronoi diagram.

Therefore the results of <ref> [Kl, KW, KMM] </ref> apply to both nearest- and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams.

Klein proposes to replace the distance notion by bisecting curves. Each pair of sites are separated by curves which divide the plane into two portions each corresponding to one site. <p> Theorem 3. D P has the properties 1, 2, and 3 0 above. Moreover, 1. The bisector of every pair of points consists of disjoint simple curves. 2. Curves portions of different bisectors intersect a finite number of times. We next follow the approach of <ref> [KW] </ref> and show additional properties of a polygon-offset distance function and the respective nearest-site Voronoi diagram. Theorem 4. Every cell of V n P is connected and jV n P j = O (nm). <p> This is sufficient for applying Theorem 4.1 of <ref> [KW] </ref> and obtaining the claim. 2 3.2 Computing the Diagram We define (following [KW]) the (ff; ff)-support as follows. <p> This is sufficient for applying Theorem 4.1 of <ref> [KW] </ref> and obtaining the claim. 2 3.2 Computing the Diagram We define (following [KW]) the (ff; ff)-support as follows. <p> It is trivial to verify that D P has an (ff; ff)-support. Similarly set fi to the slope of ` j and fi to the slope of e j . Obviously ff 6= fi and the claim follows. 2 Now we apply the algorithmic framework of <ref> [KW] </ref> to establish the following: Theorem 9. Let S be a set of n points in the plane. A compact representation of V n P (S) can be computed in O (n log n log m + m) expected time. Proof. <p> A compact representation of V n P (S) can be computed in O (n log n log m + m) expected time. Proof. The needed topological properties of D P have already been established. This is sufficient for applying Theorem 5.1 of <ref> [KW] </ref> and obtaining the claim for a constant m. The extra log m factor comes from the cost of the primitive function (computing a Voronoi vertex), which is called (due to the randomized divide-and-conquer paradigm) O (n log n) times. <p> For this purpose we show that D P fits the framework of Mehlhorn, Meiser, and Rasch [MMR] which follows Klein's unifying approach <ref> [KW, Kl] </ref>. Mehlhorn et al. show that under some conditions the complexity of the furthest-site Voronoi diagram is O (n), where n is the number of sites. First we adopt some terminology of [MMR]. Let p; q be a pair of points in the plane. <p> This corresponds to the fact that cells in the furthest-site Voronoi diagram may well be disconnected. We have thus shown that the furthest-site Voronoi diagram (with respect to D P ) can be defined in terms of a dominance system (by moving to its dual). Therefore the results of <ref> [Kl, KW, KMM] </ref> apply to both nearest- and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams.

Reference-contexts: For the case of nearest-neighbor diagrams this was improved by McAllister, Kirkpatrick, and Snoeyink <ref> [MKS] </ref>, who give a deterministic O (n (log n + log m) + m)-time method for constructing a compact Voronoi diagram complete enough for answering nearest-neighbor queries for a given convex distance function in O (log n + log m) time. <p> We apply the tentative prune-and-search paradigm of Kirkpatrick and Snoeyink [KS], as utilized by McAlister et al. <ref> [MKS] </ref>, to the polygon-offset distance function. <p> Bisecting curves are then represented implicitly by the relative positions of the sites that define them. 2 4 Compact Nearest-Site Polygon-Offset Vor. Diagram We now extend the work of McAllister, Kirkpatrick, and Snoeyink <ref> [MKS] </ref>. They describe in detail an algorithm for constructing a compact nearest-site Voronoi diagram where the underlying scaled distance function is defined by a convex polygon. <p> by maintaining a coarse "dual" of it: For each vertex of the full diagram, the compact diagram maintains a set of spokes (minimum-length segments from the vertex to the sites), and each polygonal site is replaced by the convex hull of vertices of the site in which spokes occur. (See <ref> [MKS, p. 81, Fig. 4] </ref> for an illustration.) This allows the complexity of the compact diagram to be O (n) instead of O (nm), where m is the complexity of P . <p> To save space in this extended abstract, we assume the familiarity of the reader with <ref> [MKS] </ref> and sketch how to generalize the compact Voronoi diagram to a convex polygon-offset distance function. <p> This suffices to prove the spoke properties (Lemmas 2.2-2.6 of <ref> [MKS] </ref>) and the correctness of the plane-sweep algorithm (Lemmas 3.1-3.4 and Theorems 3.5, ibid.) We omit here the details for lack of space. For the second goal we prove the following theorem: Theorem 10. <p> The elegance of this approach is in that "disappearing" edges are reflected by regions that correspond to pairs of non-consecutive vertices along P . The query thus requires O (log m) time. 2 Thus we are able to replicate the claims of <ref> [MKS] </ref> regarding the running time of the primitive operations (Lemmas 3.13-3.15). In particular, the function vertex (ABC) (given three sites A, B, and C, it returns the Voronoi vertex around which they appear counter-clockwise) can still be implemented so that it runs in O (log n + log m) time.

Furthermore, we can benefit from all the results of <ref> [MMR] </ref> on this diagram, namely, that it is a tree, and that we can compute it by a randomized algorithm in O (n log nK) time, where K is the time needed by a primitive function which considers 5 sites.
