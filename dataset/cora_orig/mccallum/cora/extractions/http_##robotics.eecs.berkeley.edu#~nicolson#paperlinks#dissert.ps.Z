Reference-contexts: Using these boundary conditions we expect the somewhat unrealistic result that the ratio of tangential pressure to normal pressure at the edges of the contact will be infinite <ref> (Bentall and Johnson, 1967) </ref>. To allow a more realistic solution would require the introduction of partial slip, or micro-slip, regions in the contact area. Recall, however, that we are mainly interested in the low frequency components of the pressure distribution.

Reference-contexts: Using the same technique for tactile data is much worse due to the reduced spatial resolution of the data. To use machine vision techniques it is first necessary to invert the spatial low pass filter caused by the rubber layer so as to reconstruct a higher resolution surface image <ref> (Berger and Khosla, 1991) </ref>. This technique is ill-conditioned and leads to noise amplification. This technique also assumes the the sampled array is just a low pass filtered version of the normal surface displacement when in fact the sampled data is due to both normal and shear tractions on the surface. <p> In (Speeter, 1990) a UTAH/MIT hand was equipped with tactile sensors, however the extreme complexity of the system coupled with noise, calibration, and a sensor with a high force threshold made feedback control difficult. Edge tracking using tactile feedback was shown in <ref> (Berger and Khosla, 1991) </ref>. In (Sikka and Zhang, 1992) orientation of a line was determined using a binary vision technique but this was not integrated into a control algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Such a high sensitivity required a capacitance detection circuit utilizing a a coherently demodulated driver signal. The circuit used was a slight modification of that of <ref> (Berkemeier, 1990) </ref>. Analog multiplexors were used to select a particular outer and inner strip at a time.

Reference-contexts: There are essentially two approaches to this problem, namely active or passive touch. In the passive touch approach an a priori set of contact locations is used and the global shape is determined from data from touches at these points. In <ref> (Berkemeier and Fearing, 1993) </ref> the axis of a surface of revolution is determined in this manner. In an active touch approach the sensor is scanned over the object using the tactile 11 1. Should subsurface strain or surface displacement sensors be used? 2.

Reference-contexts: For 114 dry contacts it is generally accepted that the coefficient of friction is proportional to the true area of contact <ref> (Bowden and Tabor, 1950) </ref>. For hard materials the true area of contact varies linearly with normal load, however, for elastic contacts, Hertzian analysis reveals that the real contact area is proportional to the 2/3 power of the normal load (Schallamach, 1952).

Reference-contexts: One of the goals of this dissertation is to address the reliability and appropriateness of sensor interpretation algorithms based on linear elasticity. A linear elastic model was used in <ref> (Canepa et al., 1992) </ref> to investigate the effectiveness of neural nets to predict contact shape. Singular value decomposition was used to analyze the linear map from indenter shape to subsurface stress for a fixed contact area and show that the rubber layer acts like a low-pass filter. <p> In reference to previous work, this indicates that the use of shear stress to predict contact area as used in <ref> (Canepa et al., 1992) </ref> would be difficult in the presence of tangential loading. We may also use the shear strain cut off to explain the response of the SAII afferents of the human tactile sensory system. Recall that the SAII afferents responded best to static skin stretch.

Reference-contexts: It has also been shown that compliant materials with a large f seemingly suitable for grasping can have their friction coefficient reduced by a factor of 10 with the introduction of water contamination <ref> (Cutkosky et al., 1987) </ref>. It is then not clear whether a large f or a consistent f is more important for grasping.

Reference-contexts: It is then not clear whether a large f or a consistent f is more important for grasping. It can be argued that a consistent f , obtained perhaps even by boundary lubrication to reduce slip-stick effects <ref> (Dupont and Dunlap, 1993) </ref>, is more amenable to grasping tasks since sliding can be more reliably anticipated and, if necessary, controlled. Alternatively one could actively estimate the onset of sliding, and hence the friction coefficient, by use of slip sensors (Tremblay and Cutkosky, 1993).

Reference-contexts: As has been shown in theory, thicker rubber layers were shown to exhibit a lower spatial cut-off frequency. 10 1.2.3 Sensing and manipulation It is only recently that tactile array sensors have been integrated into manipulation tasks. Tracking of the center of pressure during manipulation was demonstrated in <ref> (Fearing, 1989) </ref>. Closed loop control of contact location with tactile feedback was demonstrated in (Montana, 1989). In (Speeter, 1990) a UTAH/MIT hand was equipped with tactile sensors, however the extreme complexity of the system coupled with noise, calibration, and a sensor with a high force threshold made feedback control difficult.

Of those, (Speeter, 1988) achieved the highest spatial resolution, however the minimum sensed force was 30 grams, compared to 0.5 grams for <ref> (Fearing, 1990) </ref>. As our intended manipulation platform uses grasping forces in the range from 0 to 4 Newtons, the rubber strain gauge transducer is not sensitive enough. The decreased spatial resolution of current cylindrical capacitive sensor designs can be can be compensated for with better sensor spatial response modeling. <p> The decreased spatial resolution of current cylindrical capacitive sensor designs can be can be compensated for with better sensor spatial response modeling. The optical waveguide design of (Maekawa et al., 1992b) 8 has the same spatial resolution as <ref> (Fearing, 1990) </ref>, however it can not provide pressure distribution information, only contact area and net force. 1.2.2 Analysis techniques Though many sensors have been constructed, analysis of their performance in most cases has been limited to sensitivity of a single cell and their ability to produce "touch pictures". <p> As is well known, and will be shown in detail in Chapter 2, subsurface strain measurements can provide low-pass filtered estimates of the surface pressure distribution. It has been shown that subsurface strains can been estimated to 0.1 % strain <ref> (Fearing, 1990) </ref>. Surface displacement sensors are capable of resolving 6.8 microns of normal displacement over a range of 800 microns (Hutchings et al., 1994). Figure 1.1 compares the sensed displacement and strain fields and the corresponding sample points for a capacitive strain and an ultrasonic displacement sensor. <p> What is the correct choice of sensor depth given sensor spacing? Can aliasing be tolerated to some degree as it was in <ref> (Fearing, 1990) </ref>? 4. Can we remove the proximity effect evidenced by other capacitive sen sor designs without adversely affecting the sensor impulse response? 5. <p> contact location c are p 0 = P ; p c r b k = P sin (k c ) Q ; q c Q cos (k c ) ; q s Q sin (k c ): To allow comparison with the cylindrical model to the half plane used in <ref> (Fearing, 1990) </ref> we use the same parameters. = 8:3 fl 10 4 N r a = 8:9mm r b = 12:7mm Additionally we assume that the sensors are located at radius r s = r a + 0:5mm. the surface of the cylinder at c = 0. <p> The following relationships are immediately clear Odd Shape , Even Slope , Odd Pressure Even Shape , Odd Slope , Even Pressure. What is most important is that the spectrum of the odd shapes is near zero at the low frequencies. Given the sensor parameters of <ref> (Fearing, 1990) </ref> it would be very difficult to sense the odd part of the shape since, as Figure 2.4 shows, that information will be filtered out. <p> Unfortunately most of those sensors can not be used on a round sensor needed for grasping and manipulation. Commercially available sensors that can be used on round fingers do not provide the sensitivity required for shape discrimination. For this reason the design of <ref> (Fearing, 1990) </ref> was adopted with a few changes. Sensor spacing around the circumference was halved to reduce the aliasing that was predicted in Chapter 2. Dow Corning silicone rubber was used instead of isoprene rubber as silicone rubber demonstrated reduced hysterisis in preliminary experiments. <p> Detailed schematics for the circuit are given in Appendix E. 66 Following <ref> (Fearing, 1990) </ref>, we can relate the change in output voltage to normal strain as follows v s v o = r a r s where v o is the voltage output when nothing is touching the sensor and v s is the voltage under load. <p> Creep, however, is another problem. As can be seen in the first touch of Figure 3.13, the sensor output increases as a decaying exponential with the same time characteristic as the relaxation. Compared to the dynamic response of isoprene rubber <ref> (Sladek and Fearing, 1990) </ref>, the relaxation and creep times are approximately one half that of isoprene rubber. 3.3.6 Summary Table 3.3 gives a summary of the sensor characteristics described in this section. <p> We will see later that with a non-zero dc component, E improves in conditioning and thus is more stably inverted. It is interesting to see that the unshielded sensors fit to smaller values than the shielded sensors. These smaller values are similar to that found by <ref> (Fearing, 1990) </ref>. Based on the successful calibration for the edge contact, calibration was also performed for both flat and edge contacts. That is, a flat contact was touched to the sensor at 1 o intervals just like the edge contact.

Reference-contexts: Next techniques for calibrating the sensor and matching the element responses to predicted model responses are discussed. Finally, the reliability of indenter curvature estimation is explored. It has already been shown that indenter curvature can be determined from static touch <ref> (Fearing and Binford, 1991) </ref>, however recent results from finite-element modeling indicate that it is not possible to classify indenter types from subsurface strain measurements using linear elastic models (Ellis and Qin, 1994; Ricker and Ellis, 1992). <p> According to this noise model, estimates of the 94 curvature can be very fine, with standard deviations of R in the tenths of a millimeter for a 200 N/m load. This is in accordance with Fearing's results <ref> (Fearing and Binford, 1991) </ref> using a linear elastic model, however it is much better than Ellis's results (Ellis and Qin, 1994) using a finite element model that included the copper strips of the sensing elements.

Reference-contexts: This formulation looks different from that of <ref> (Fearing and Hollerbach, 1985) </ref> due to the substitution of the cylindrical geometry parameters into the half plane model. It is assumed that the depth, given by r b r is less than r b .

Reference-contexts: Recently Goodwin conducted experiments to determine the ability of humans to discriminate spheres of varying radii pressed into human fingerpads at various loads after a period of training <ref> (Goodwin et al., 1991) </ref>. It was found that, at a 75 % level, humans 1 (Johnson and Hsiao, 1992), page 247. 6 could discriminate between a flat surface and a radius of 204 mm, and between a radius of 6.95 mm and 6.17 mm.

Reference-contexts: For comparison, humans are able to discriminate between a flat surface and a radius of 550 mm when they are allowed to move their fingers over the surface of the object <ref> (Gordon and Morison, 1982) </ref>. Perhaps the most important difference between these two studies is training. For the static perceptual measurements feedback was given, whereas in the haptic case it was not. The reason being that static discrimination of curvature improved with training, but haptic discrimination did not require training.

Reference-contexts: Since forces and moments have different units, some sort of scaling is required. The choice of the scaling factor can lead to different "optimal" 117 grasps. Through the use of friction limit surfaces <ref> (Goyal et al., 1991) </ref> proper scaling between forces and moments for soft finger contacts can be accomplished, removing the ambiguity of "optimal" grasps. In this chapter we will be focusing on regrasping of convex planar objects.

Reference-contexts: Since we are restricted to planar grasping with a two fingered hand the task of determining a regrasping strategy is greatly simplified. First it has been shown that every planar convex object has at least two possible contact pairs <ref> (Jameson, 1985) </ref> for a frictionless two-fingered grasp. The grasp pairs correspond to locations of the double normals on the object. Of these contact pairs there are only two different directions of the contact line between the grasp points.

Reference-contexts: Slip was also detected using a static array, however the dynamic tactile sensing approach of (Howe and Cutkosky, 1989; Howe et al., 1990) is perhaps better suited for this task. A nice demonstration of planar manipulation with and without tactile feedback is given in <ref> (Maekawa et al., 1992a) </ref>. Contact location information from the tactile sensor was shown to improve manipulation with rolling contacts. <p> This chapter explores this issue through the use of a two fingered hand equipped with tactile sensors. Previous work using tactile sensors in a dextrous hand has focused on improved translation and rotation of the grasped object <ref> (Maekawa et al., 1992a) </ref>. In the following experiments the redundant degrees of freedom in a 6 degree of freedom planar manipulator are used with the contact location and curvature estimates provided by the tactile sensor to improve grasp quality through in-hand manipulation.

This leaves us with two possible "optimal" grasps, one at the maximum diameter of the object, the other at the minimum diameter of the object.

Reference-contexts: Pressure distribution for contact cylinders in which one cylinder has a rigid core have been addressed before <ref> (Nowell and Hills, 1988) </ref>. In that case the primary interest was accurate reconstruction of the surface pressure. <p> As was shown by Nowell and Hillis <ref> (Nowell and Hills, 1988) </ref>, the rigid core of the cylindrical finger results in a larger load and peak pressure for a given radius indenter, r c , and contact width, w . <p> The resulting normal pressure is again parabolic and agrees with the results of (Bentall and Johnson, 1967; Nowell and Hills, 1988). The resulting shear tractions are not so well behaved due to the truncation of the fourier series. Results obtained using an integral equation approach, <ref> (Nowell and Hills, 1988) </ref>, show a discontinuity in the shear tractions at the edges of the contact. Due to Gibbs phenomena, this leads to ringing in the truncated fourier series. <p> For an arbitrary indenter shape we have shown a way to compute an approximation of the pressure distribution up to a maximum spatial frequency. Comparison of pressure distributions computed in this manner agreed with those of <ref> (Nowell and Hills, 1988) </ref>. In particular we have noted two effects, a rigid core and contact adhesion, that can lead to a narrower subsurface strain profile than would be predicted by a Hertz model.

Reference-contexts: For hard materials the true area of contact varies linearly with normal load, however, for elastic contacts, Hertzian analysis reveals that the real contact area is proportional to the 2/3 power of the normal load <ref> (Schallamach, 1952) </ref>. It has also been shown that compliant materials with a large f seemingly suitable for grasping can have their friction coefficient reduced by a factor of 10 with the introduction of water contamination (Cutkosky et al., 1987).

Reference-contexts: Comparisons of friction coefficients for round and chisel indenters support this intuition <ref> (Schallamach, 1969) </ref>. To investigate this question the apparatus shown in A flat sample of 3 mm thick rubber was dragged at constant velocity over an indenter attached to a force and torque sensor. Weights were placed above the rubber slab to apply the normal force. <p> These results contradict the intuition that an edge contact would have a larger f and instead indicate that contacts which generate a larger contact area result in a larger f . This is consistent with the notion that f is proportional to contact area. This is not consistent with <ref> (Schallamach, 1969) </ref>, however that study used much larger loads in the range of 1 kg to 10 kg. For larger loads one can expect non-linear deformations that will result in a "piling-up" of the rubber material.

Each of these responds maximally to different types of mechanical stimuli due to different transduction methods, depth, and location within the skin layers.

Reference-contexts: Tracking of the center of pressure during manipulation was demonstrated in (Fearing, 1989). Closed loop control of contact location with tactile feedback was demonstrated in (Montana, 1989). In <ref> (Speeter, 1990) </ref> a UTAH/MIT hand was equipped with tactile sensors, however the extreme complexity of the system coupled with noise, calibration, and a sensor with a high force threshold made feedback control difficult. Edge tracking using tactile feedback was shown in (Berger and Khosla, 1991).

Surprisingly even with a two-point threshold of 30 mm on the arm, diameters varying as little as 4 mm could be distinguished.
