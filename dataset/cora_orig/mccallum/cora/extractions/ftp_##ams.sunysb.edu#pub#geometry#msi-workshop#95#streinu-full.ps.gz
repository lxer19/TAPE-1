Title: Visibility in Pseudo-Polygons and Vertex-Edge Pseudo-Visibility Graphs  
Author: Joseph O'Rourke Ileana Streinu 
Date: September 25, 1995  
Abstract: We extend the notion of visibility graph to pseudo-polygons defined on generalized configurations of points (cf. Goodman and Pollack[4]). This abstracts the classic concept by removing the condition that visibility between two points be along straight-line segments. We also introduce a new type of polygon visibility graph, the vertex-edge visibility graph. More generally we define the vertex-edge visibility graph for pseudo-polygons. We demonstrate that it encodes more combinatorial information about the pseudo-polygon than does the vertex visibility graph. We study the reconstruction problem for vertex-edge pseudo-visibility graphs. Given a bipartite graph G satisfying certain properties, which can all be checked in polynomial time, we show that we can define a generalized configuration of points and a pseudo-polygon on it, so that its vertex-edge pseudo-visibility graph is G. This provides a full characterization of vertex-edge pseudo-visibility graphs and a polynomial time algorithm for the decision problem. It also implies that the decision problem for visibility graphs of pseudo-polygons is in NP (as opposed to the same problem with regular straight-edge visibility, which is only known to be in PSPACE, cf. Everett[3]).

Reference-contexts: Starting investigations with this richer structure simplifies proofs and holds the promise of allowing greater progress toward reconstruction. Second, we generalize the notion of straight-line visibility to visibility along pseudo-lines. Here we reinterpret and clarify several results of Abello and Kumar <ref> [1] </ref>, as well as taking them a step further. We mix our two ideas by starting with the vertex-edge visibility graph of a pseudo-polygon, and showing that recognition for such graphs can be done in polynomial time. As a consequence, the recognition of visibility graphs for pseudo-polygons is in NP.

Reference-contexts: It is worthwhile to compare this results with the best result known for straight-line visibility graphs, for which the best known algorithm for the decision problem is based on the PSPACE algorithm for deciding the existential theory of the reals, cf. Everet <ref> [3] </ref>. 7 Conclusion. Open questions. Are all pseudo ve-graphs realizable with straight lines? 9 Note that the same abstract ve-graph might have several pseudo-polygons realizing it. Our construction of a pseudo-polygon from an abstract ve-graph chooses a particular one.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 characterizes pseudo-visiblity vertex-edge graphs, and Section 6 reaches the NP conclusion. 2 Pseudo-Polygons defined on Generalized Config urations of Points Generalized configurations of points have been introduced by Goodman and Pollack in <ref> [4] </ref>. They capture the combinatorial properties of sets of planar points. In the dual space, line arrangements are generalized to pseudo-line arrangements. Both concepts (pseudo-line arrangements and generalized configurations) are intimately related to oriented matroids of rank 3 (see Bjorner et al.[2]). <p> If v k1 sees e k then v k is convex, otherwise is reflex. 3.4 The ve-graph implies the i-sequences The i-sequences (cf. Goodman and Pollack <ref> [4] </ref> who introduced them for generalized configurations of points) are the sequences of lines containing the edges in the visibility graph, ordered circularly around v k by their planar layout, starting from the v k v k+1 direction, 8k.
