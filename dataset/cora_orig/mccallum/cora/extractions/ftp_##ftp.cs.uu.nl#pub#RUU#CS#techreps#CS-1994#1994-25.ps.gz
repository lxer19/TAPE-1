Title: Feasibility of Design in Stereolithography  
Author: Boudewijn Asberg Gregoria Blanco Prosenjit Bose Jesus Garcia-Lopez Mark Overmars Godfried Toussaint Gordon Wilfong and Binhai Zhu 
Abstract: We study the feasibility of design for a layer-deposition manufacturing process called stere-olithography which works by controlling a vertical laser beam which when targeted on a pho-tocurable liquid causes the liquid to harden. In order to better understand the power as well as the limitations of this manufacturing process, we define a mathematical model of stereolithog-raphy (referred to as vertical stereolithography) and analyze the class of objects that can be constructed under the assumptions of the model. Given an object (modelled as a polygon or a polyhedron), we give algorithms that decide in O(n) time whether or not the object can be constructed by vertical stereolithography. If the answer is in the affirmative, the algorithm reports a description of all the orientations in which the object can be made. We then define a more flexible model that more accurately reflects the actual capabilities of stereolithography (referred to as variable-angle stereolithography) and again study the class of feasible objects for this model. We give an O(n) time algorithm for polygons and O(n log n) as well as O(n) time algorithms for polyhedra. We show that objects formed with variable-angle stereolithography can also be constructed using another manufacturing process known as gravity casting. Furthermore, we show that the polyhedral objects formed by vertical stereolithography are closely related to polyhedral terrains which are important structures in geographic information systems (GIS) and computational geometry. In fact, an object built with variable-angle stereolithogra-phy resembles a terrain with overhangs, thus initiating the study of more realistic terrains than the standard ones considered in geographic information systems. Finally, we relate our results to the area of grasping in robotics by showing that the polygonal and polyhedral objects that can be built by vertical stereolithography can be clamped by parallel jaw grippers with any positive sized gripper.

Reference-contexts: Much research has been done on the problem of gripping or immobilizing an object with a multifingered hand [2, 12, 19, 20, 24]. Recently, researchers have considered the problem of finding a "geometric" grip of a planar object <ref> [25, 10, 1, 26] </ref>. Souvaine and Van Wyk [25] studied the problem of clamping a polygon with a pair of parallel line segments, motivated by robot hands known as parallel jaw grippers that are pairs of parallel plates. Each plate is referred to as a gripper.

Reference-contexts: It is no longer clear whether the feasibility of a convex polyhedron can be determined in O (n) time since a face f of a polyhedron may have O (n) adjacent faces. However, the total complexity of all adjacencies is linear by Euler's formula (see <ref> [3] </ref>). Therefore, testing all faces for validity by the local test implied in Lemma 3.11 can be done in O (n) time. We now turn our attention to polyhedral objects that are not necessarily convex. <p> This can be done in linear time. 6. Output the valid bases. The correctness of the algorithm follows from Theorem 3.3. As for the time complexity, we see that step 1 can be done in O (n) time by Euler's formula (see <ref> [3] </ref>). Step 3 takes linear time by the algorithm given in Section 3.1. Furthermore, by Lemma 3.9 testing each candidate face can be done in O (n) time simply by testing its outward normal with the outward normals of all the other faces.

Intuitively, a monotone terrain admits vertical walls whereas our definition does not.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we show that the polygonal and polyhedral objects built by vertical stereolithography can be clamped by parallel jaw grippers with any positive sized gripper. 2 Notation and Preliminaries The objects studied are simple polygons and simple polyhedra as defined in <ref> [22] </ref>. The object will always be oriented so that the direction of formation being discussed is the negative y-direction. 3 Therefore a direction of formation defines the orientation of the object. <p> The convex hull of a simple polyhedron, however, cannot be computed in linear time, but can be computed in O (n log n) time (see <ref> [22] </ref>). Therefore, although this approach provides an optimal solution to the problem in two dimensions, a solution in three dimensions will require an additional log n factor. To this end, we explore the following alternate solution that can be generalized to the three-dimensional version of the problem.
