Abstract: Parallel discrete event simulation systems (PDES) are used to simulate large-scale applications such as modeling telecommunication networks, transportation grids, and battlefield scenarios. While a large amount of PDES research has focused on employing multiprocessors and multicomputers, the use of networks of workstations interconnected through Ethernet or ATM has evolved into a popular and effective platform for PDES. Nonetheless, the development of efficient PDES systems in network computing environments is not without obstacles that severely degrade simulator performance. To better understand how these factors degrade performance as well as develop new algorithms to mitigate them, we investigate the use of graphical visualization to provide insight into performance evaluation and simulator execution. We began with a general-purpose network computing visualization system, PVaniM, and used it to investigate the execution of an advanced version of Time Warp, called Georgia Tech Time Warp (GTW), which executes in network computing environments. Because PDES systems such as GTW are essentially middle-ware that support their own applications, we soon realized these systems require their own middleware-specific visualization support. To this end we have extended PVaniM into a new system, called PVaniM-GTW by adding middleware-specific views. Our experiences with PVaniM-GTW indicate that these enhancements enable one to better satisfy the needs of PDES middleware than general-purpose visualization systems while also not requiring the development of application specific visualizations by the end user.

Reference-contexts: The SIMAN/Cinema (Glavach and Sturrock 1993) system provides a large number of graphical capabilities including barcharts, histograms, and plots. Furthermore, the Cinema system provides CAD support and dynamic status displays and animations may be viewed in real time or in a postmortem fashion. The XTracker <ref> (Bellenot and Duty 1995) </ref> system provides graphical visualizations of the execution of parallel simulations. XTracker provides Gantt-like charts of simulation activities on a per node basis and can also display event messages as traffic between objects. Finally, (Graham et al. 1996) proposes a visual environment for distributed Time Warp simulations.

Reference-contexts: To reduce load management and process migration overheads, LPs are grouped into clusters and migrated as a unit. For a detailed explanation of our BGE algorithm, we refer the reader to <ref> (Carothers et al. 1996) </ref>. 4 RELATED VISUALIZATION SYSTEMS Several simulation systems have utilized visualization in one form or another. Many of these systems are referred to as Visual Interactive Simulation (VIS) systems (Okeefe 1987).

These 4096 LPs are grouped into 64 clusters of 64 LPs each, and they are mapped to the processors such that the amount of remote communications is minimized.

Furthermore, the Cinema system provides CAD support and dynamic status displays and animations may be viewed in real time or in a postmortem fashion.

Reference-contexts: To better understand how these factors degrade simulator performance and help develop algorithms that mitigate them, we propose the use of Graphical Visualization (GV). GV has been shown to be a useful aid in performing several activities associated with parallel computing such as verification, performance analysis, and program understanding <ref> (Kraemer, Stasko 1993) </ref>. The usefulness of GV for these activities stems from the highly developed image processing system possessed by humans, which allows us to track multiple complex visual patterns and to easily spot anomalies in these patterns.
