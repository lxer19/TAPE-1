Reference-contexts: This has been shown to perform slightly better than diffs for migratory sharing patterns. However, the only comparison in the literature shows that a TreadMarks-style LRC protocol with diffs performs overall better than the one with software dirty bits due to the cost of instrumentation <ref> [ACD + 96] </ref>. <p> Studies that have proposed protocols or extensions have evaluated them usually with only a small set of simple programs. The programs, problem sizes and machine parameters used have also been limited and different across studies, making comparisons difficult. Despite a few comparative studies <ref> [CDK + 94, ACD + 96] </ref> it is not well understood whether the SVM approach works well for important classes of applications, whether the approaches that use a small amount of hardware support have substantial advantages over all-software implementations, or how architectural and application parameters affect the answers to these questions. <p> EC binds data to locks explicitly while in ScC the binding is implicit and dynamically created by the memory accesses. Global Synchronization. The explicit binding in EC has difficulty including global synchronization in the model <ref> [ACD + 96] </ref>. The alternatives are: (1) not to bind data to barriers at all; (2) to have explicit binding as for locks; (3) to bind the entire address space. The first approach substantially limits the intuition of shared memory since barriers do not cause modifications to become visible. <p> On the other hand, although the communication volume may be higher in ScC than in EC due to page fragmentation, the page size transfers allow ScC to benefit from potential prefetching <ref> [ACD + 96] </ref>. Programming Effort. ScC is potentially easier to program than EC because in most cases it does not require any change to RC programs. When RC programs are not ScC, adding explicit scope annotations in ScC requires similar program understanding as for adding explicit binding in EC.
