Abstract: The inference rules so far only model intuitionistic logic, and some classically true propositions such as A _ :A (for an arbitrary A) are not derivable, as we will see in Section ??. There are three commonly used ways one can construct a system of classical natural deduction by adding one additional rule of inference. ? C is called Proof by Contradiction or Rule of Indirect Proof, :: C is the Double Negation Rule, and XM is referred to as Excluded Middle. The rule for classical logic (whichever one chooses to adopt) breaks the pattern of introduction and elimination rules. One can still formulate some reductions for classical inferences, but natural deduction is at heart an intuitionistic calculus. The symmetries of classical logic are much better exhibited in sequent formulations of the logic. In Exercise 1.3 we explore the three ways of extending the intuitionistic proof system and show that they are equivalent. In the formulation of natural from Section 1.1 correct use of hypotheses and parameters is a global property of a derivation. We can localize it by annotating each judgment in a derivation by the available parameters and hypotheses. Since hypotheses and their restrictions are critical for linear logic, we give here a formulation of natural deduction for intuitionistic logic with localized hypotheses, but not parameters. For this we need a notation for hypotheses which we call a context. Here, "" represents the empty context, and ; u:A adds hypothesis ` A labelled u to . We assume that each label u occurs at most once in a context in order to avoid ambiguities. The main judgment can then be written as ` A, where u

Reference-contexts: As we will see in Chapter ??, these proof terms form a -calculus closely related to functional programming. When parameters, hypotheses, and proof terms are all localized our main judgment becomes decidable. In the terminology of Martin-Lof <ref> [ML94] </ref>, the main judgment is then analytic rather than synthetic. We no longer need to go outside the judgment itself in order to collect evidence for it: An analytic judgment encapsulates its own evidence. 1.4 Exercises Exercise 1.1 Prove the following by natural deduction using only intuitionistic rules when possible.
