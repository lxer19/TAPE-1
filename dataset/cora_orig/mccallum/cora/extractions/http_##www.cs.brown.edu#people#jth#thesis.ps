Title: Getting Useful Gender Statistics from English Text

Abstract: Gender, understood as a lexical feature, is important for anaphora because it narrows down the number of possible referents involved in a typical pronoun resolution situation. This work describes an automatic method for obtaining reliable guesses about the gender of entities in a corpus using free text. By using a simple but unreliable anaphora algorithm repeatedly over a large corpus, the probable genders of referenced entities can be compiled and given a salience ranking. These statistics are an inexpensive way to add on gender-feature information to a statistical anaphora resolution algorithm.

Reference-contexts: In the present system, a statistical parser using a grammar induced from held-out corpus is used (see <ref> (Charniak, 1997) </ref>) simply as a tagger. This apparent parser overkill is a control to ensure that the part of speech tags assigned to words are the same using the previous noun heuristic and the syntactic Hobbs algorithm, to be explained in the next section.

Reference-contexts: This decision is made by ranking the referents by log-likelihood ratio, termed salience, for each referent with its associated pattern of references. The likelihood ratio is adapted from Dunning <ref> (Dunning, 1993, page 66) </ref> and uses the raw frequencies of each pronoun class in the corpus as the null hypothesis, Pr (gc0 i ) as well as Pr (ref 2 gc i ) from equation 1. salience = 2 log 0 B Y all classes i gc0 observations with class i

Reference-contexts: Discourse entities continue to have gender in English, but the only time that gender becomes manifested is when the entity is referred to anaphorically with a gender-marked pronoun. Furthermore, gender is a psychological factor that has been demonstrated <ref> (Ehrlich, 1980) </ref> to exert an influence on human anaphora resolution. Recent psychological theories 1 Although in French we run into the distinction between "lexical" gender and "actual" gender, and issue which we will ignore in the following.

Reference-contexts: This strategy is certainly simple-minded but it accounts for a healthy fraction of (43%) of pronoun reference situations in experiments performed by Niyu Ge on a hand-tagged subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus (see <ref> (Ge & Charniak, 1998) </ref>). In the present system, a statistical parser using a grammar induced from held-out corpus is used (see (Charniak, 1997)) simply as a tagger.

Reference-contexts: I am very grateful to the NLP group at Brown for help in this work, especially to Eugene Charniak, Mark Johnson, Niyu Ge and Brian Roark. GENDER STATISTICS FROM ENGLISH TEXT 2 <ref> (Gernsbacher, 1989) </ref> of referential access have posited gender to have an "enhancing" or "inhibiting" effect, suggesting a statistical characterization. Here we present an automatic method for estimating the probability that nouns occurring in a large corpus of English text manifest masculine or feminine gender, or denote inanimate things.

Reference-contexts: This method is based on simply counting co-occurrences of pronouns and noun phrases, and as such can employ any method of analysis of the text stream that results in referent/pronoun pairs (cf. <ref> (Hatzivassiloglou & McKeown, 1997) </ref> for another application in which no explicit indicators are available in the stream). We present two very simple methods for finding referent/pronoun pairs, and also present an application of a surprise statistic that can indicate how confident we should be about the predictions the method makes.

Reference-contexts: In fact the only part of speech tags necessary are those indicating nouns and pronouns. When this strategy is applied to the entire corpus, the result is a set of observations of pronoun/noun co-occurrences. Syntactic Hobbs algorithm Similarly, the Hobbs algorithm <ref> (Hobbs, 1976) </ref> also produces a set of observations of co-occurrences, although these are co-occurrences of full noun phrases with their referring pronoun.

Reference-contexts: One semantic feature which undoubtedly exists on at least proper noun phrases is gender whether the referenced entity is male, female or inanimate. In French, such a feature could be read off the morphological form of a noun, (perhaps using finite state techniques as in <ref> (Silberztein, 1987, page 98) </ref>) but in English virtually the only remaining reflex is in the form of referring pronouns 1 . Discourse entities continue to have gender in English, but the only time that gender becomes manifested is when the entity is referred to anaphorically with a gender-marked pronoun.
