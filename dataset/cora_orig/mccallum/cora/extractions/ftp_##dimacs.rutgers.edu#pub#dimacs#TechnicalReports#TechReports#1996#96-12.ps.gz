Reference-contexts: If Steps 2 - 5 of Algorithm k-Weak Leveling are applied to P then at all times, for all x 2 U , either R (x) is unbounded or (i) R (x) [1 k; 1 + k], or (ii) R (x) <ref> [2; 1 + (n + 1)k] </ref> or (iii) R (x) [1 (n + 1)k; 0]. Proof. <p> We will show, by induction on t, that when R (a t ) first becomes a bounded set, R (a t ) <ref> [2; 1 + (t + 1)k] </ref>. First we handle the base case. Let w be the element of U for which applying the Narrowing Steps (hereafter referred to as NS) to the pair (w; a 1 ) results in R (a 1 )'s first becoming bounded. <p> Thus w 2 C and R (w) [1 k; 1 + k] and a 1 ~ w. Now after applying by NS 3 and 4, to the pair (w; a 1 ) the result is R (a 1 ) <ref> [2; 1 + 2k] </ref>, as desired. Now assume that when R (a j ) is first narrowed to a bounded set that R (a j ) [2; 1 + (j + 1)k] for j = 1; 2; : : : ; s 1. <p> Now after applying by NS 3 and 4, to the pair (w; a 1 ) the result is R (a 1 ) [2; 1 + 2k], as desired. Now assume that when R (a j ) is first narrowed to a bounded set that R (a j ) <ref> [2; 1 + (j + 1)k] </ref> for j = 1; 2; : : : ; s 1. Consider a s and let (a s ; w) be the pair chosen when R (a s ) is first narrowed to a bounded set. <p> Thus either w 2 C or w = a i for some i &lt; s. In the first case, the argument given in the base case shows R (a s ) <ref> [2; 1 + 2k] </ref>. Now consider 11 w = a i for some i &lt; s. By the induction hypothesis and the fact that ranges only narrow as the algorithm continues, R (a i ) [2; 1 + (i + 1)k]. <p> Now consider 11 w = a i for some i &lt; s. By the induction hypothesis and the fact that ranges only narrow as the algorithm continues, R (a i ) <ref> [2; 1 + (i + 1)k] </ref>. <p> By the induction hypothesis and the fact that ranges only narrow as the algorithm continues, R (a i ) [2; 1 + (i + 1)k]. If a s ~ a i , R (a s ) is narrowed so that R (a s ) <ref> [2; 1 + (i + 1)k + k] </ref> [2; 1 + (s + 1)k]: If a s a i , R (a s ) is narrowed so that R (a s ) [2; 1+(i+1)k1] [2; 1+(s+1)k]: 2 Theorem 12 With input Q = (Y; ), Algorithm k-Weak Leveling runs in O <p> If a s ~ a i , R (a s ) is narrowed so that R (a s ) [2; 1 + (i + 1)k + k] <ref> [2; 1 + (s + 1)k] </ref>: If a s a i , R (a s ) is narrowed so that R (a s ) [2; 1+(i+1)k1] [2; 1+(s+1)k]: 2 Theorem 12 With input Q = (Y; ), Algorithm k-Weak Leveling runs in O (jY j 4 k) time for k 1, <p> a s ~ a i , R (a s ) is narrowed so that R (a s ) [2; 1 + (i + 1)k + k] [2; 1 + (s + 1)k]: If a s a i , R (a s ) is narrowed so that R (a s ) <ref> [2; 1+(i+1)k1] </ref> [2; 1+(s+1)k]: 2 Theorem 12 With input Q = (Y; ), Algorithm k-Weak Leveling runs in O (jY j 4 k) time for k 1, and O (jY j 2 ) time for k = 0. Proof. <p> ~ a i , R (a s ) is narrowed so that R (a s ) [2; 1 + (i + 1)k + k] [2; 1 + (s + 1)k]: If a s a i , R (a s ) is narrowed so that R (a s ) [2; 1+(i+1)k1] <ref> [2; 1+(s+1)k] </ref>: 2 Theorem 12 With input Q = (Y; ), Algorithm k-Weak Leveling runs in O (jY j 4 k) time for k 1, and O (jY j 2 ) time for k = 0. Proof. Algorithm Stackem runs in O (jY j 2 ) time by Proposition 6.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that P = (X; ) is a weak order if and only if it admits a real-valued function u : X ! R so that x y in P iff u (x) &lt; u (y) <ref> [3] </ref>. Such a function is called an ordinal utility function [6]. It places an ordering on the elements of P which is similar to a linear ordering except that ties are allowed.

Reference-contexts: An O (jXj 3 ) recognition algorithm appears in [10]. In contrast, the class of totally bounded bitolerance orders has been characterized only in special cases. The most general of these is when the underlying ordered set is bipartite <ref> [4] </ref>, that is, its longest chain has at most two elements. Clearly, a bipartite order is 1-weak for example, assign all minimal elements a level of 1 and all remaining elements a level of 2. <p> Then the suborder of P induced by two adjacent levels is also a bounded bitolerance order. Now by Theorem 2.12 of <ref> [4] </ref>, the desired indexing exists. (3) =) (1) Now suppose that P is a 1-weak ordered set with 1-leveling function lev so that each pair of adjacent levels can be indexed as in the hypothesis of (3). <p> The equivalence of (1) and (2) in Theorem 19 is false in general. A separating example (which is 2-weak) appears in <ref> [4] </ref>. 5 Future Directions In future work [in preparation] we study the weakness of an ordered set, where the weakness wk (P ) is the minimum k such that P is k-weak.

Reference-contexts: In this case we write C (v) to denote the central region [`t (v); rt (v)] of v's interval. The family of bounded bitolerance orders is one of the few classes of tolerance orders that has been completely characterized. An O (jXj 3 ) recognition algorithm appears in <ref> [10] </ref>. In contrast, the class of totally bounded bitolerance orders has been characterized only in special cases. The most general of these is when the underlying ordered set is bipartite [4], that is, its longest chain has at most two elements. <p> In case (ii), rt (x) = rt (x r ) = iM r and `e (y) = `e (y s ) iM r, so again x 6 y in Q. 2 Together with Theorem 19, Langley's recognition algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> for bounded bitolerance orders immediately implies a recognition algorithm for totally bounded bitolerance orders in the 1-weak case. The equivalence of (1) and (2) in Theorem 19 is false in general.

Reference-contexts: The (2,2)-free orders are those with no induced 1 + 1 which are precisely the linear orders. The (3,2)-free orders are those with no induced 2 + 1, which is the class of 0-weak (or just weak) orders. Using the Scott-Suppes Theorem <ref> [11] </ref> (or see [12]), semi-orders (also known as unit interval orders) are the class of (4,2)-free orders, that is, those with no induced 2 + 2 and no induced 3 + 1. Corollary 15 is a general result relating k-weak orders to (M; 2)-free orders.
