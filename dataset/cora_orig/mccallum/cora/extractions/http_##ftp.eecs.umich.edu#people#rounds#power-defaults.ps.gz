Abstract: We show how two general notions of domain theory, the logic induced from the Scott topology on a domain, together with the Smyth powerdomain, interact with the theory of default reasoning introduced by Reiter [19]. We define extensions, which are fixed points of a certain non-monotonic operator on a Scott domain induced by a normal default set over that domain. We specialize this definition to the Smyth powerdomain, which consists of all nonempty compact sets in the Scott topology, ordered by reverse subset inclusion. Our main result is a general "splitting theorem" showing how any extension E of a union of compact sets U and V can be written as a union E = E U [ E V , where E U and E V are either empty or extensions of U and V respectively. This result holds in arbitrary Scott domains, provided the set of "power defaults" is obtained from "default constraints", a natural way of introducing defaults over the Smyth powerdomain. We apply our methodology in first-order systems. As in [20], we equip standard first-order logic with a Kleene 3-valued partial model semantics. Then, using our methodology, we add power defaults to this semantic system. We show how, in this application, the Extension Splitting Theorem sanctions default reasoning by cases. We point out, though, that our methodology applies much more generally than the first-order case. It is a valid method for default reasoning in any setting appropriately modeled by Scott domains.

Reference-contexts: We write this as P ] (X), where X is a given Scott domain. It is possible to prove that if one starts with a Scott domain, then the Smyth powerdomain is again a Scott domain. See <ref> [1] </ref>. Remark. The official Smyth powerdomain for us will not include an inconsistent (top) element. We do occasionally adjoin such an element, though, when defining extensions for this domain. <p> Formally, we have the following result. For a proof see <ref> [1] </ref>. Theorem 3.3 The Smyth powerdomain P ] (X) of a Scott domain (X; v) is isomorphic to the domain consisting of all nonempty Scott-compact subsets of X, ordered by reverse subset inclusion. The basis elements are the nonempty compact open subsets of X.

Reference-contexts: Reiter's extensions now appear in the semantics, not in the syntax. In [20] we showed that this semantics gives a partial solution to the conceptual problems with open defaults pointed out by Lifschitz [13], and Baader and Hollunder <ref> [3] </ref>.

In that section we also treat the the problem of open defaults. For this, we use an example of Baader and Hollunder in <ref> [3] </ref>. We show how, as a corollary of the Splitting Theorem, reasoning by cases is handled. We discuss the KLM non-monotonic consequence laws over the Scott topology of a domain. <p> Reiter's method involves the actual reduction of open to closed defaults, which requires a preliminary step of Skolemizing all the axioms and the consequents of all defaults. We review an example due to Baader and Hollunder <ref> [3] </ref>. They work in the context of trying to add defaults to terminological logics. (These are a class of special logics appropriate for knowledge representation.) Another study, more complete, has been presented by Kaminski [10].

Reference-contexts: Like relational data bases, situations consist of sets of tuples, which we call infons. The usage is from situation theory <ref> [4] </ref>. Our starting points are minimal partial models of quantifier-free formulas. (This restriction on formulas can be relaxed, though not arbitrarily.) The idea is that we start with a specific world description, and instantiate it in a minimal model.

Reference-contexts: The relations j= and =j are read "positively satisfies" and "negatively satisfies" respectively. As usual, we write A (M; C) j= ' iff for all (s; ff) we have (s; ff) j= '. Our semantics is a standard one for Kleene 3-valued logic; see <ref> [5] </ref> for a complete treatment. We need the following result about the semantics. Lemma 3.1 (Persistence) For a sentence ' of L, if s j= ' and s t, then t j= '.

Reference-contexts: We discuss the KLM non-monotonic consequence laws over the Scott topology of a domain. Section 7 is a brief conclusion. 2 Disjunctive defaults and power defaults We begin with an example due to Poole [18], and discussed both by Gelfond et al. [8], and by Brewka <ref> [6] </ref>. We use Brewka's statement, and Gelfond's introduction. By default, people's left arms are usable, but a person with a broken left arm is an exception, and similarly for right arms. <p> The fact that both extensions split is what allows skeptical reasoning by cases to go through. We should point out that the idea of generalizing extensions to differing domains has been used before, again implicitly. Brewka, in defining cumulative default logic <ref> [6] </ref>, considers pairs of (finite) theories as 6 constituents of defaults, instead of theories. Intuitively, Brewka is moving from a domain D to the domain D fiD, though he does not employ the usual product order.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, Brewka is moving from a domain D to the domain D fiD, though he does not employ the usual product order. Similar remarks apply to the modified extensions of Lukaszewicz, [14], and the J-extensions of Delgrande and Jackson <ref> [7] </ref>. In all of these works, ordered pairs are used to keep track of the justifications used in a default derivation. In contrast, we move from D to P (D), the Smyth powerdomain of D, in order to get a disjunctive default logic.

Reference-contexts: We would prefer some other preference mechanism to order the way extensions are built. Finally, we need to see if our notions of extension have any desirable complexity properties. This will involve studying the reductions used, for example, by Gottlob <ref> [9] </ref> to show p 2 -completeness of skeptical non-monotonic consequence for propositional default logic to see if we can modify them to our semantics.

Reference-contexts: This paper shows how to extend the techniques introduced in [20] to the disjunctive case. Our solution can still deal satisfactorily with open defaults, and it comes close 2 to satisfying the basic Kraus-Lehmann-Magidor <ref> [11] </ref> axioms for non-monotonic consequence relations, in particular the Or law, which sanctions "reasoning by cases." This law is a consequence of our general Extension Splitting Theorem, whose proof seems to be non-trivial.

Reference-contexts: We have to defer further discussion to the appropriate sections, except to mention here that the default constraints turn into updates in the Smyth powerdomain, an idea introduced by Libkin <ref> [12] </ref>. Viewing semantics in this way, though, does not mean that we cannot recast the usual notions of default logic. We apply our methodology to first-order systems. As in [20], we equip standard first-order logic with a Kleene 3-valued partial model semantics. <p> If is a compact open set, and a 2 (A), we say that A [a a " ] =" ((A) n fag) [ (" a " ) is an update of A, provided it is not empty. This definition is due to Libkin <ref> [12] </ref>. It says that an elementary way to improve information in a compact open set is to improve one of its generators. Notice that "improving" a generator is represented by intersection here, corresponding to the Smyth ordering.

Reference-contexts: The result is that our logic is ordinary first-order logic, but its semantics is now nonmonotonic. Reiter's extensions now appear in the semantics, not in the syntax. In [20] we showed that this semantics gives a partial solution to the conceptual problems with open defaults pointed out by Lifschitz <ref> [13] </ref>, and Baader and Hollunder [3].

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, Brewka is moving from a domain D to the domain D fiD, though he does not employ the usual product order.

Reference-contexts: The Reflexivity law, the Right Weakening law, and the And law are trivial. The Cut law is a consequence of Theorem 4.1 (5), valid in any Scott domain. The Cautious Monotony law fails; one can adapt the original counterexample of Makinson <ref> [15] </ref> to this setting. Finally, the Or law follows directly from the Splitting Theorem. 7 Conclusion We have seen how power defaults give rise to disjunctive default reasoning in a variety of settings.

The chauvinistic default (4) instantiated with Gordy, can fire, yielding :Woman (Gordy). Combined with (5) this yields Bachelor (Tom), which is at odds with Tom's being married to Mary. We repeat some of our comments in <ref> [20] </ref>. <p> This would allow us to hypothesize observable properties, and to conclude universal generalizations of such properties, even in the infinite case. We allowed this in <ref> [20] </ref>, but the j relation considered there was perhaps too conservative, as it did not even sanction the Cut law. A second problem was mentioned in the introductory example section on broken arms. It should be possible to combine our semantic method with Brewka's proposal to make default logic cumulative.

Reference-contexts: The sets " peng = fpeng; pengtweetg and " fly = ffly; f lytweetg are both principal filters and open. Their union is also open. Since the domain is finite, all open sets are compact open. 3.2 Information sysytems Next, we review Scott's <ref> [22] </ref> idea of information systems, which can be thought of as general concrete monotonic "rule systems" for building Scott domains. We include this definition because our first-order examples will use the concept. <p> Specifically we can take the token set to be the set (D), the coherence relation to be the compatibility predicate of D, and X ` a iff a v X.
