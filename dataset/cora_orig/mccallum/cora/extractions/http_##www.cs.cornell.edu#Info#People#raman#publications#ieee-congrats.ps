Abstract: In this paper, we describe our prototype implementation of the CONGRATS system first implemented at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bom-bay, (IITB)for his Masters project by one of the authors of this paper, T. V. Raman. The prototype we have built here is only a small subset of the actual system, and is meant more to show what can be done using sound and elucidate the concepts involved. When complete it will provide a whole new range of educational aids for the visually impaired, and thereby open up subjects that have till now remained inaccessible.
