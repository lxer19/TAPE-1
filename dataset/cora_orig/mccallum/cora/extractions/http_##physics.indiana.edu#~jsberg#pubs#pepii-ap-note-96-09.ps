Title: Status of the Transverse Multibunch Modes in PEP-II  
Author: J. Scott Berg 
Date: March 25, 1996  
Pubnum: PEP-II AP Note 96.09  
Abstract: In [Ber95b], I computed multibunch mode growth rates for the PEP-II B Factory. Since then, I have updated the broadband impedance model [BR95b, Ber96a], Robert Rimmer has measured the cavity modes in the high power test cavity, and Yunhai Cai has supplied updated lattice parameters. I am also using a slightly different model for the feedback [Ber96a], and I have included a way to estimate the effects of chromaticity. Finally, I have made more detailed computations regarding the expected effect of Landau damping. Putting all these together, the results from computing the growth rates of the multibunch modes in the PEP-II B Factory are given, and the conditions necessary to assure stability are discussed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The method described in <ref> [Ber96a] </ref> is used to compute the growth rates of multibunch modes in the PEP-II B Factory. I use the program described in [Ber96b]. This method differs from the usual methods for computing multibunch growth rates in that it takes into account coupling between the multibunch modes. <p> The current will always be increased by the ratio of 1746=1658, since there are 1658 filled buckets in the nominal case (see <ref> [Ber96a] </ref> for the reason for this). Table 2 gives a list of the combinations of E, I, and N cav which will be used. Potential-well distortion will be taken into account. <p> There have been some changes in the model used, and many of the parameter values have changed. <ref> [Ber96a] </ref> uses a model very close to this one, but the parameters here are slightly different, and also include both rings and both planes of transverse motion. 3.1 Resistive Wall The resistive wall impedance is given by the formula Z RW p R RW i!=! 0 fl Work supported by Department <p> This impedance must of course be multiplied by the number of cavities. The longitudinal impedance (5) is scaled by fi 0 c=! to obtain the transverse impedance <ref> [Cha93, Ber96a] </ref>. 3.4 Cavity Higher Order Modes A preliminary list of the cavity higher order modes is given in table 4. <p> Ring N cav hfi x i (m) hfi y i (m) LER 6 9.4443 20.0286 HER 20 13.5111 14.8817 Table 6: Average fi-functions for the cavities. 3.6 Average fi-functions Each impedance must be multiplied by the fi-function, averaged over the region where the impedance is <ref> [Ber96a] </ref>.

It's interaction with mode coupling and chromaticity is not clear. I should emphasize that one cannot ignore mode coupling in this calculation. Mode coupling gives a significant effect, probably making the cavities significantly more difficult to damp.

This geometry makes F 0.4219 in the horizontal direction, and 0.8263 in the vertical direction [GvZZ93]. The vacuum chamber is made of 6063 T5 aluminum alloy [PEPa], which has a resistivity of 1= = 32 -nm [ASM90]. The lengths of the low-energy ring arc sections can be estimated to be the same as those of the high energy ring arc sections (see below), giving 1490.482 m [Dal]. <p> Worst-case values are obtained by performing this scaling with b p = 2:7559 cm for the low energy ring and b p = 2:5 cm for the high energy ring (the vertical size of the arc section chamber <ref> [PEPa, Ng] </ref>). The impedance will not be constant for all frequencies; it is expected to begin to roll off at high frequencies. Since the average behavior at high frequencies is expected to be similar to that of a cavity, a high-frequency roll-off of ! 3=2 is assumed [Hei].

Reference-contexts: Thus, R RW for the arc sections is 460 k=m horizontally and 902 k=m vertically. The straight sections of the low-energy ring vacuum chamber are round with a diameter of 3.5 in. <ref> [PEPb] </ref>. F is 1 for this geometry [GvZZ93]. The vacuum chamber is made of 304 stainless steel [Hun], giving an resistivity of 1= = 720 -nm [ASM90]. The length of the straight sections is 708.836 m (see below).

Reference-contexts: The results are summarized in table 5. The average fi-functions at the cavities are a special case. In the low-energy ring, if there are 6 cavities, they will be placed in the positions labeled CAV3, CAV4, and CAV5 in the lattice file <ref> [Sch] </ref>. If there are 8 cavities, the two extra will be placed in the positions labeled CAV2. In the high-energy ring, if there are 20 cavities instead of 24, the cavities will be removed from the positions labeled CAV5 [A-D] 08.

Reference-contexts: The transverse damping rates are mostly negligible when compared with the radiation damping rate. The largest source of Landau damping will be from the nonlinearity in the longitudinal potential, especially when potential-well distortion is included. Using the formulas given in <ref> [ZCB86] </ref> (equations (IV.5.23-28), and the discussion in section IV.6), one can determine if the m = 1 modes of the beam are stable or not in the presence of tune shift with amplitude in the longitudinal direction. <p> One first determines the real and imaginary parts of the coherent frequency using the method of [Ber96a, Ber96b]. One then uses the method described in <ref> [ZCB86] </ref> to find whether the m = 1 modes are stable with Landau damping, using the appropriate tune shift with amplitude given in table 3. This amounts to asking whether the modes are on the stable or unstable side of the diagram in figure 1. <p> This is done for the low energy ring at 3.109 GeV [Hei]. 10 Also, it should be noted that the way Landau damping was computed (using the method of <ref> [ZCB86] </ref>) may need to be re-examined or re-computed in the context of the method of [Ber96a]. It's interaction with mode coupling and chromaticity is not clear. I should emphasize that one cannot ignore mode coupling in this calculation.
