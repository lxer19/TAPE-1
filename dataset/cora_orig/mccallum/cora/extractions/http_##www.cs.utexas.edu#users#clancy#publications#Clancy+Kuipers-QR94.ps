Abstract: Qualitative reasoning uses incomplete knowledge to compute a description of the possible behaviors for dynamic systems. For complex systems containing a large number of variables and constraints, the simulation frequently is intractable or results in a large, incomprehensible behavioral description. Abstraction and aggregation techniques are required during the simulation to eliminate irrelevant details and highlight the important characteristics of the behavior. The total temporal ordering of unrelated events provided by a traditional state-based qualitative representation is one such irrelevant distinction. Model decomposition and simulation addresses this problem.

Reference-contexts: Using TCP to reason about physical systems, however, requires a significant amount of work by the modeler. Furthermore, it is unclear how this system can be extended to incorporate advances in other qualitative reasoning paradigms. Other techniques <ref> [Clancy and Kuipers, 1993, Fouche and Kuipers, 1991] </ref> have eliminated the irrelevant temporal correlation of events by combin ing behaviors and states into a more abstract repre-sentation. <p> I-G are eliminated via abstraction during the simulation of the glucose component.

Chatter box abstraction selectively eliminates distinctions in the derivative of the chattering variables thus making the simulation tractable.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Qualitative simulation derives a description of the possible behaviors of a dynamic system from a structural representation. The structural representation details the relationship between the variables within the system through constraints. Traditionally, a state-based approach <ref> [Forbus, 1984, Kuipers, 1986, De Kleer and Brown, 1984] </ref> is used to describe the device behavior by a set of qualitative states of the system and the transitions between these states.

Reference-contexts: An event occurs when a variable crosses a landmark value or alters its direction of change. The combinatoric complexity of providing a total ordering of events is a general problem encountered within artificial intelligence when trying to reason about the physical world <ref> [Hayes, 1985] </ref>. For many qualitative reasoning tasks, this level of detail is irrelevant. Branching on unrelated temporal distinctions significantly increases the complexity of the simulation. In addition, this branching makes it more difficult to interpret the behavioral description thus obscuring the relevant behavior.
