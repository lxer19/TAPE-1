Abstract: This paper presents a method that can be used for the elicitation and specification of requirements and high-level design. It supports stakeholder-based modeling, rapid feasibility feedback to marketing, and the interpersonal dynamics that are necessary to develop a product. The method centers on the role of the facilitator, an independent agent whose purpose is to build the Integrated System Model (ISM). The ISM is the result of merging the independent system views from all stakeholders at any given abstraction level. Formulation of this method was based on the real-world experience of developing a complex, high-technology medical product with critical time-to-market pressures. It has proven to be a practical approach to the evolution of requirements definition and provides a necessary link to the marketing aspect of a product.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the facilitator method presented in this paper provides an overall framework and structure for interaction with stakeholders, and relies on a more active role of the stakeholders involved to achieve the consensus that leads to completeness <ref> [1] </ref>. The notion of viewpoint was introduced as early as 1977 by Ross and Schoman [10]. They defined viewpoint as being a particular aspect of a product or product development, such as performance, rather than as being a perspective held by a particular stakeholder in the product.

Reference-contexts: One goal of the facilitator method is to use these prototypes, and the people behind them, to the fullest extent possible during requirements definition. This is in keeping with the basic philosophy of Participatory Design <ref> [2] </ref>. But rather than simply including users in the process, the facilitator method seeks to include all stakeholders and their differing viewpoints. For example, a common practice in industry is to develop a system and then "throw it over the wall" to quality, production, and service staff.

Reference-contexts: Words are interpreted in the context of the listener [5, 7]. Without a means to anchor the discussion, the roundtable type of communication can be ineffective. Stakeholders require a medium of exchange and a neutral mechanism for achieving a common understanding <ref> [3] </ref>. With a concrete, yet neutral, mechanism in which all stakeholders are invested, the communication can be definitive and real progress can be made. There are other methods that propose the use of a facilitator. One of the most popular such methods is joint applications development (JAD) [11]. <p> The reason to ask for this project-related information at an early stage is to make explicit all assumptions and areas that are not yet well defined or understood. People pay close attention when commitments need to be made. This is a so-called "truth-generating mechanism" <ref> [3] </ref>. When the data from the stakeholders are taken in aggregate, they reveal what is not known about the system, areas of discrepancy, and risk areas. The facilitator takes the individually crafted information and forms as complete a picture as possible from the given data. <p> It is important to notice that the facilitator method places responsibility for the completeness and correctness of the information where it should be, namely on the stakeholders and not on the analyst. 3.1 The Facilitator's Role Hall <ref> [3] </ref> gives the following definitions for various third party roles: "A facilitator helps with the logistics in the proceedings of meetings. A mediator guides or helps people come to a voluntary agreement. <p> The fact that there are diverse stakeholders working on a complex project with many issues needing rapid resolution makes developing requirements and high-level design definition an "integrative bargaining problem" <ref> [3] </ref>. The facilitator reduces this integrative bargaining problem to a "distributive bargaining problem" [3] at which point the facilitator is no longer necessary. It may take multiple facilitators to achieve this, because as the abstraction levels become more specific, facilitators with different specialties may be needed. <p> The fact that there are diverse stakeholders working on a complex project with many issues needing rapid resolution makes developing requirements and high-level design definition an "integrative bargaining problem" <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Using a notation that is overly rich can impede communication among the stakeholders at this level. For example, in the case study, many of the specialized notations for the structured analysis real-time extensions used by Hatley and Pirbhai <ref> [4] </ref>, such as control bars and dotted line notation, confused the stakeholders and had to be compromised. As a system gets more defined and the stakeholders more comfortable, more sophisticated notations can be introduced. The ISM is then given back to the stakeholders for iterative refinement and discussion.

Reference-contexts: For example, communicating face-to-face in a roundtable fashion often hides elements of the diversity that exist. Words are interpreted in the context of the listener <ref> [5, 7] </ref>. Without a means to anchor the discussion, the roundtable type of communication can be ineffective. Stakeholders require a medium of exchange and a neutral mechanism for achieving a common understanding [3].

Reference-contexts: Leite and Freeman laid the foundations for using viewpoint resolution as a means to validate and formulate a more complete picture of requirements during the elicitation process <ref> [6] </ref>. Viewpoint resolution for them is a process of soliciting a mental position from significant actors in a project. The discrepancies between viewpoints are evaluated and eventually integrated into a single solution or view. <p> The use of a facilitator as ISM builder, rather than as formal analyst, speeds up the process of developing a system model that can be used for requirements specification. This can be achieved with some, but effectively little, impact on completeness, using viewpoint resolution <ref> [6] </ref> as modified for this method. The use of a commitment perspective helps validate the graphical model perspective of the ISM and it provides the measure by which a project should be evaluated.

Reference-contexts: Further work on viewpoints continues, but much of it focuses on tools that can be used to represent and support multiple views <ref> [8] </ref>. The facilitator method presented here uses a modified form of viewpoint resolution to achieve requirements definition quickly for large projects. It differs from the approach introduced by Leite and Freeman in a number of ways.

Reference-contexts: When combined with market feasibility information, leveling minimizes losses while promoting incremental investment decisions and effective concurrent design efforts. There is a growing awareness of the need to address the "intersection of the technical and the human" in the development process <ref> [9] </ref>. The facilitator method 0-8186-7252/96 $5.00 c fl 1996 IEEE 190 therefore attempts to address the human interaction element of producing satisfactory project requirements and design definitions. Most large projects involve diverse people working together to develop a product. <p> While the analyst in this case study was rather experienced, the standard methods that were available for her to use were too inefficient. Potts characterizes this as "slim pickings" when talking about the gap between the research and the practical application <ref> [9] </ref>. This was an extreme case, but generally the real-world still cannot afford the time most standard methods require, since they rely primarily on the analyst for the modeling and, as a result, require the analyst to become an expert in many complex areas.

There are other methods that propose the use of a facilitator. One of the most popular such methods is joint applications development (JAD) <ref> [11] </ref>. The method presented in this paper differs from JAD in that there is less reliance on extensive group meetings during the elicitation and definition of requirements. While meetings are still used in our method, they occur infrequently and do not always require the presence of the facilitator.
