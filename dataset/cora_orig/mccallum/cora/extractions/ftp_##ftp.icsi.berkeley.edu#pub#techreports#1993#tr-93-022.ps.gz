Title: A Multivalued Evolutionary Algorithm  
Author: Hans-Michael Voigt Joachim Born Ivan Santibanez-Koref 
Date: April 1993  
Pubnum: TR-93-022  
Abstract: With this paper we present a Multivalued Evolutionary Algorithm (MEA) which is inspired by fuzzy set theory. The genetic representation and encoding is done in such a way that no inferences can be drawn from phenotype to genotype. This representation influences the used genetic operators. The basic operators of the algorithm will be explained and comparisons for global optimization problems with recently published results will be presented.

The test functions are listed in Table 7. For F 7 we used the extended BGA mutation scheme and for F 8 multivalued intermediate recombination. The termination criterion was used as in [15] and [8].

Reference-contexts: For the structuring of artificial neural networks we used e.g. generative grammars [18], especially Lindenmayer-Systems [6].

Generic to the incorporation of individual development into an overall evolution process is the impossibility of drawing inferences from phenotype to genotype, i.e. the mapping from genotype to phenotype is not isomorphic.
