Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling packet transmissions in a broadcast, single-hop WDM network, with tunability provided only at one end. Our objective is to design schedules of minimum length to satisfy a set of traffic requirements given in the form of a demand matrix. We address a fairly general version of the problem as we allow arbitrary traffic demands and arbitrary transmitter tuning latencies.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is considered as the most promising approach to fully exploiting the vast information-carrying capacity of single-mode fiber. Our focus in this paper is on a WDM network architecture known as the single-hop architecture <ref> [1] </ref>. Single-hop networks are especially attractive as they are all-optical in nature. In other words, any information transmitted into the medium remains in the optical form until it reaches its destination.

Reference-contexts: Such devices do exist today; however, their capabilities are limited in terms of both tunability range and speed, and the ideal device, one that can tune across the useful optical spectrum in sub-microsecond times <ref> [2] </ref> remains elusive. We show, however, that careful network design can mask the effects of non-ideal devices, making it possible to build single-hop WDM networks using currently available tunable optical transceivers.
