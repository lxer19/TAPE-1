Title: Approximations for the Disjoint Paths Problem in High-Diameter Planar Networks  
Author: Jon Kleinberg Eva Tardos 
Abstract: We consider the problem of connecting distinguished terminal pairs in a graph via edge-disjoint paths. This is a classical NP-complete problem for which no general approximation techniques are known; it has recently been brought into focus in papers discussing applications to admission control in high-speed networks and to routing in all-optical networks. In this paper we provide O(log n)-approximation algorithms for two natural optimization versions of this problem for the class of nearly-Eulerian, uniformly high-diameter planar graphs, which includes two-dimensional meshes and other common planar interconnection networks. We give an O(log n)-approximation to the maximum number of terminal pairs that can be simultaneously connected via edge-disjoint paths, and an O(log n)-approximation to the minimum number of wavelengths needed to route a collection of terminal pairs in the "optical routing" model considered by Raghavan and Upfal, and others. The latter result improves on an O(log 2 n)-approximation for the special case of the mesh obtained independently by Aumann and Rabani. For both problems the O(log n)-approximation is a consequence of an O(1)-approximation for the special case when all terminal pairs are roughly the same distance apart. Our algorithms make use of a number of new techniques, including the construction of a "crossbar" structure in any nearly-Eulerian planar graph, and develops some connections with classical matroid algorithms.

Reference-contexts: For the 2 special case of the two-dimensional mesh, Awerbuch, Gawlick, Leighton, and Rabani [4] give an on-line O (log n log log n)-approximation algorithm, and independently of our work Aumann and Rabani <ref> [2] </ref> give an (off-line) O (log n)-approximation algorithm. <p> Approximation algorithms for (T ) have been considered in a number of previous papers concerned with routing in all-optical networks: Raghavan and Upfal [21] give a 3=2-approximation algorithm when the underlying graph is a tree, and a 2-approximation when the underlying graph is a cycle. Aumann and Rabani <ref> [2] </ref> give an O (log 2 n)-approximation when the underlying graph is the two-dimensional mesh. Here we consider the class of nearly-Eulerian, uniformly high-diameter planar graphs (defined precisely below), which includes most common high-diameter planar interconnection networks such as the mesh and the hex. <p> At this high level, the above outline is analogous to the outline of the algorithm of Aumann and Rabani <ref> [2] </ref> for the special case of the mesh. For our general class of graphs, a number of additional difficulties arise, for which we develop the following techniques. First consider the problem of routing paths from the boundary of C 1 to the boundary of C 2 . <p> Notice that the n fi 2n mesh has a crossbar of size n 1 connecting the two smaller sides. Aumann and Rabani <ref> [2] </ref> use this natural mesh-crossbar for routing. <p> Now consider the "coordination problem" of making sure that s ` is routed to the boundary if and only if its partner t ` is routed. For the maximum disjoint paths problem Aumann and Rabani <ref> [2] </ref> use a maximum flow computation to select a maximum size subset of the terminals that can be simultaneously routed to the boundary of C 1 and C 2 . <p> Thus the problem of constructing a maximum simple coordinated flow is a special case of Edmonds' matroid intersection theorem; another consequence of this matroid structure is that the greedy algorithm gives a 2-approximation to the maximum simple coordinated flow. Alternately, Aumann and Rabani <ref> [2] </ref> observed that computing a maximum simple coordinated flow can be reduced to a maximum flow computation. Add a directed edge of capacity one from every terminal in C i to the corresponding terminal in C j . <p> That is, one greedily uses an approximation for the maximization problem, assigning a new color for each realizable subset that is found this way. This approach was used in the case of the mesh by Au-mann and Rabani <ref> [2] </ref> and leads to an O (log 2 n)-approximation algorithms for the problem. Here we show how the matroidal tools mentioned in Section 3.2 lead to an O (log n)-approximation algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Within this framework, the randomized rounding technique of Raghavan and Thompson [20, 19] gives good approximations for both problems. On-line algorithms for the maximum disjoint paths problem for this case are given in Awerbuch et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. In many applications, however, each communication path consumes a large fraction of the available bandwidth on a link; thus it makes sense to consider approximation algorithms for graphs without a large number of parallel edges.

Reference-contexts: The intractability of the disjoint paths problem does not appear to be simply a theoretical phenomenon. Awerbuch, Gawlick, et. al. <ref> [4] </ref> observe that much of the difficulty in establishing virtual circuits in large-scale communication networks comes from the lack of good heuristics for finding disjoint paths. <p> For the maximum disjoint paths problem Garg, Vazirani, and Yannakakis [12] give a 2-approximation for trees with parallel edges (the maximization problem is NP-complete, though deciding realizability is easy). For the 2 special case of the two-dimensional mesh, Awerbuch, Gawlick, Leighton, and Rabani <ref> [4] </ref> give an on-line O (log n log log n)-approximation algorithm, and independently of our work Aumann and Rabani [2] give an (off-line) O (log n)-approximation algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Davies and McDiarmid <ref> [7] </ref> proved that if M 1 and M 2 are two strongly base-orderable matroids over the same ground set S, then S can be covered by k sets each of which is independent in both M 1 and M 2 if and only if S can be covered by k independent

Reference-contexts: Moreover, such a covering can be found in polynomial time. Combined with Edmonds' matroid covering theorem <ref> [8] </ref> the Davies-McDiarmid theorem implies that if for every S 0 S we have min ( 1 (S 0 ); 2 (S 0 )) 1 k jS 0 j, then S can be covered by k sets each of which is independent in both M 1 and M 2 . 4

Reference-contexts: Then it is not difficult to show (see e.g. [23]) that these sets form the independent sets of a matroid M G (S; T ) over the ground set S; matroids arising by this construction are called gammoids. We make use of Edmonds' matroid intersection theorem <ref> [9] </ref>. For a matroid M , let (U ) denote the rank of a subset U of the ground set; this is the size of the largest independent set contained in U .

Reference-contexts: A linear time algorithm for this problem has been recently obtained by Wagner and Weihe [22]. We will use an extension of the Okamura-Seymour theorem due to Frank <ref> [10] </ref> to build the "crossbar" mentioned above. <p> Observe that G 0 0 is nearly-Eulerian, and all terminals lie on its outer face. In such a situation, an extension of the Okamura-Seymour theorem due to Frank <ref> [10] </ref> says that the following strict cut condition is sufficient for realizability: jffi (S)j &gt; jD (S)j for all S 6= . We have already verified the (non-strict) cut condition, and hence consider this as follows.

Reference-contexts: We note that such evenness conditions have proved crucial in much previous work on exactly solvable special cases of this problem (see the survey by Frank <ref> [11] </ref>). Our first main result is an O (log n)-approximation algorithm for the maximum disjoint paths problem, in nearly-Eulerian, uniformly high-diameter planar graphs. The second of our main results is an O (log n)-approximation to (T ) for the same class of graphs. <p> We need a further assumption that the degree of every internal vertex (i.e. those not on the outer face) is even. This is a version of the parity condition that appears in a large number of previous results on exactly solvable special cases of the disjoint paths problem <ref> [11] </ref>. We will call a plane graph for which the degree of every internal vertex is even nearly-Eulerian. It is easy to verify that the two-dimensional mesh and hex are nearly-Eulerian uhd plane graphs. <p> We will use an extension of the Okamura-Seymour theorem due to Frank [10] to build the "crossbar" mentioned above. For other results on polynomially solvable special cases of the realizability problem see the survey by Frank <ref> [11] </ref>. 3.2 Matroidal tools The connection between paths and matroids that we use here stems from the following construction (see e.g. [23] for definitions and basic facts related to matroids). Let G be a graph, and S and T two subsets of the vertices. <p> Essentially the only work that has been done in the setting of general graphs has been on exact algorithms for a fixed number of terminal pairs or for special cases involving a graph embedded on a fixed surface, as in work of Robertson and Seymour and of Schrijver (see <ref> [11] </ref>). Most of the techniques presented in this paper cannot be directly applied in the non-planar case; but it is possible that analogous notions could prove useful. Acknowledgments We thank Yonatan Aumann and Yuval Rabani for showing us a preliminary version of their work on optical routing.

The first is a theorem of Okamura and Seymour <ref> [17] </ref> concerning an exactly solvable special case of the disjoint paths problem; the second gives us some useful tools from matroid theory. 3.1 An exactly solvable special case A large amount of work has been done on identifying special cases of the disjoint paths problem that are solvable in polynomial time. <p> It is interesting that very little is known about the existence of polynomial-time algorithms in cases not satisfying this parity condition; some variants become NP-complete when the condition is lifted [16].
