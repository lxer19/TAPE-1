Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is a method of axiomatizing actions and their effects in standard first-order logic in a way that solves the frame problem. It has long been thought that the frame problem makes monotonic logics inadequate for reasoning about action; this paper shows how to achieve the benefits of a nonmonotonic logic using a monotonic logic. The use of first-order logic permits considerable simplicity and a frame axiom that is explicit, fixed, and intuitive. Moreover, complex worlds of actions can be axiomatized: fluents can be momentary or dynamic, the preconditions of actions need not be fully known, and the ramifications of actions can be stated unambiguously.
