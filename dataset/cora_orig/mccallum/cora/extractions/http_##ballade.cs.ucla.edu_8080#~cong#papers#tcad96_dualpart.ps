Abstract: In this paper, we study the area-balanced multi-way partitioning problem of VLSI circuits based on a new dual netlist representation named the hybrid dual netlist (HDN), and propose a general paradigm for multi-way circuit partitioning based on dual net transformation. Given a netlist we first compute a K-way partitioning of nets based on the HDN representation, and then transform the K-way net partition into a K-way module partitioning solution. The main contribution of our work is in the formulation and solution of the K-way module contention (K-MC) problem, which determines the best assignment of the modules in contention to partitions while maintaining user-specified area requirements, when we transform the net partition into a module partition. Under a natural definition of binding function between nets and modules, and preference function between partitions and modules, we show that the K-MC problem can be reduced to a min-cost max-flow problem. We present an efficient solution to the K-MC problem based on network flow computation. We apply our dual transformation paradigm to the well-known K-way FM partitioning algorithm (K-FM) and show that the new algorithm, named K-DualFM, reduces the net cutsize by 20% to 31% compared with the K-FM algorithm. We also apply the same paradigm to the K-MFFC-FM algorithm, a K-FM algorithm based on maximum fanout-free cone (MFFC) clustering reported in [10], and show that the resulting algorithm, K-DualMFFC-FM reduces the net cutsize by 15% to 26% compared with K-MFFC-FM. Furthermore, we compare the K-DualFM algorithm with EIG1[18] and Par-aboli [26], two recently proposed spectral-based bipartitioning algorithms. We showed that K-DualFM reduces the net cutsize by 56% on average when compared with EIG1 and produces comparable results with Paraboli.

Reference-contexts: The net-based partitioning approach first computes a bipar-titioning of the nets, and then transforms the net partitioning solution into a module partitioning solution <ref> [20, 9] </ref>. The multi-way partitioning algorithms include the recursive bipartitioning by Kernighan and Lin [22], a generalization of the FM-algorithm with lookahead by Sanchis [27], the primal-dual algorithm [30], and a generalization of the graph spectral-based partitioning method to multi-way ratio-cut by Chan, Schlag, and Zien [5]. <p> Since the objective of the partitioning problem is to minimize the number of nets to be cut, we believe that assigning nets, instead of modules, to partitions will lead to better partitioning solutions in general. The net-based bipartitioning algorithm by Cong, Hagen, and Kahng <ref> [9] </ref> is therefore of particular interest to us. This algorithm first computes a biparti-tioning of the nets using the graph spectral method, and then transforms a net bipartitioning solution into a module biparti-tioning solution by solving the module contention problem (to be discussed in Section 3 in detail). <p> Multi-way circuit partitioning based on dual transformation In this section, we first review IG-MATCH, the bipartitioning algorithm based on dual transformation by Cong, Hagen, and Kahng <ref> [9] </ref> and discuss its limitations for multi-way circuit partitioning. Then, we describe the K-DualFM algorithm in detail in Subsections 3.2 to 3.6 and use it to illustrate how to apply our new dual transformation technique to a multi-way partitioning algorithm. <p> This is the module contention (MC) problem: in Fig 2 (b), modules 2, 5 and 6 are in contention since they are shared by nets on both sides. A bipartite graph B was constructed in <ref> [9] </ref> as follows. The nodes in B represent the nets on the boundary of the partitioning solution of NIG . <p> It is clear that the minimum vertex covering formulation for the module contention problem is inherent to bipartitioning and cannot be easily generalized to multi-way partitioning. Also, the minimum vertex cover formulation cannot handle the area balance constraint effectively. The objective of <ref> [9] </ref> was to minimize ratio-cut size, and therefore, the area balance constraint was not an issue in their formulation. <p> The subsequent subsections describe these phases in detail. 3.3. Generating dual netlist representations The net intersection graph (NIG ) was used in <ref> [9] </ref> since the graph spectral based algorithm used in their net partitioning algorithm applies only to graphs and cannot be used for hypergraphs.

Review of the IG-MATCH algorithm The IG-MATCH algorithm partitions the NIG using a spectral based method, and then transforms the net partitioning to a module partitioning solution. <p> To further demonstrate the power and effectiveness of our multi-way circuit partitioning paradigm based dual netlist representation, we present in this subsection how to apply our paradigm to the K-MFFC-FM algorithm by Cong, Li and Bagrodia <ref> [10] </ref>. To reduce the computational complexity of partitioning very large circuits, and to take the advantage of the signal direction information, Cong, Li and Bagrodia proposed a clustering method based on maximum fanout-free cones (MFFCs) [6, 7] as a preprocessing step to their partitioning algorithm. <p> The MFFC-based clustering algorithm considers both signal direction and logic dependency, and produces a natural clustering solution in linear time. The K-MFFC-FM algorithm reported in <ref> [10] </ref> applies the K-FM algorithm directly on the clustered circuits to get very promising results. We applied our dual net transformation paradigm to K-MFFC-FM and obtained the K-DualMFFC-FM algorithm. <p> Finally, we report the results obtained by the K-DualMFFC-FM algorithm, which was described in Section 3.7. The K-MFFC-FM algorithm was developed to partition a circuit to multiple processors for parallel logic simulation. Since the goal is to minimize inter-processor communication, Cong, Li and Bagrodia <ref> [10] </ref> modified their objective function to minimize the number of nets cut while ignoring the connections between gates and input/output pads. (This is because in their application a primary input variable can be made available for every processor, and generating an output to an out put pad is equivalent to a <p> Tables 4 (a)-4 (b) show the comparison of the K-DualMFFC-FM algorithms with the original the K-MFFC-FM 4 <ref> [10] </ref> under the same objec tive function for the ICSAC85 benchmark suite (which consist of only combinational circuits and are suitable for MFFC clustering).

Reference-contexts: Our objective is to find an optimal assignment of the modules in M cont to the partitions such that the cumulative preference over all assignment edges is maximized. 3.5.3. Flow-based formulation of the K-MC problem We use the min-cost max-flow algorithm <ref> [16, 11] </ref> to compute the optimal module assignment. First, we construct an assignment network (AN) as follows. <p> Since MAX is a constant, maximizing the total preference in a module assignment solution is equivalent to minimizing cost (f ). Hence, a min-cost max-flow in N induces a module assignment with the maximum total preference function. ` We use the augmenting path algorithm <ref> [16, 11] </ref> for computing a minimum-cost maximum-flow in the assignment network. We start with a flow of value zero.

A min-cost source-to-sink path is found when the sink is reached in the best-first search process.

Reference-contexts: The net-based partitioning approach first computes a bipar-titioning of the nets, and then transforms the net partitioning solution into a module partitioning solution [20, 9]. The multi-way partitioning algorithms include the recursive bipartitioning by Kernighan and Lin [22], a generalization of the FM-algorithm with lookahead by Sanchis <ref> [27] </ref>, the primal-dual algorithm [30], and a generalization of the graph spectral-based partitioning method to multi-way ratio-cut by Chan, Schlag, and Zien [5]. To reduce the computational complexity for partitioning very large circuits, cluster-based partitioning methods have been introduced. <p> The dual net representation used in K-DualFM, named hybrid dual netlist (HDN ), is a combination of NIG and DNHG . (2) Assign nets to partitions. We use the K-FM partitioning algorithm <ref> [27, 15] </ref> to partition the nets into K partitions. (3) We transform the net partitioning solution into a module partitioning solution by solving the K-way module contention problem (K-MC).

Reference-contexts: In this case, one can show that a min-cost max-flow in the assign ment network corresponds to a module assignment solution with the minimum total wire crossing. (F2) Performance-based objective function: Some recently proposed objectives optimize for system performance under timing constraints. For example, Shih, Kuh and Tsay <ref> [28] </ref> proposed an algorithm to minimize the wirability objec tive function subject to thermal, I/O pin, and timing constraints in addition to area constraints. In (F1) we showed how to minimize the wirability function.

Reference-contexts: The min-cut based method uses the maximum flow algorithm to compute a series of minimum cuts in the given circuit in -2- order to obtain an area-balanced cut with small cut size <ref> [29] </ref>. The net-based partitioning approach first computes a bipar-titioning of the nets, and then transforms the net partitioning solution into a module partitioning solution [20, 9].

Reference-contexts: To reduce the computational complexity for partitioning very large circuits, cluster-based partitioning methods have been introduced. In this approach clusters are identified and collapsed, and the resulting clustered network is partitioned using existing partitioning methods. Clustering methods include random-walk clustering [8, 19], multicommodity-flow based clustering <ref> [31] </ref>, clique based clustering [13], geometric embedding with min-diameter clustering [1], and clustering based on maximum fanout-free cones (MFFCs) [10]. Partitioning with module replication [25, 21] and the communication-complexity based partitioning method [3] have also been proposed to further reduce the amount of interconnections.
