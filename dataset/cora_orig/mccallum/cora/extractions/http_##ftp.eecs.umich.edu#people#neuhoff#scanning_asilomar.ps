Reference-contexts: The pixel at point (i; j) in the image has intensity value P ij . Definition 1 A scan of the image is a bijection f from the closed interval of integers <ref> [1; : : : ; N 2 ] </ref> to the set of ordered pairs f (i; j) : 1 i; j N g, where the latter set denotes the points in the image. <p> This pdf can be estimated by maintaining counts of symbol occurrences within each context (as in CALIC [8]) or by estimating the parameters of an assumed pdf (as in JPEG-LS <ref> [1] </ref>). Once we have efficient estimates for the pdf within each context, coding can be done efficiently. <p> Although this question seems hard, as we mentioned earlier the techniques presented here are general and can be applied to different types of scans including progressive scans that build a pyra Context Frequency [0; 0] 1 24 + 2 k 3 24 + 32 k 3 8 + 32 k <ref> [1; 2] </ref> 4 k 3 12 1 [2; 3] 4 k 4 + 1 12 1 [3; 3] 54 k 4 + 2 [3; 4] 4 k 4 + 1 Table 1.

Reference-contexts: Practical lossless compression techniques usually impose some structure on the source sequence in the form of a model that can suitably represent the sequence. 2.1. Context models For image data, a particularly popular model that has been widely used is a context model <ref> [5] </ref>. Here, it is assumed that the distribution of the current symbol only depends on some limited context in which it occurs. <p> Context selection When using a context modeling technique for lossless compression, the question naturally arises: how does one select the contexts to be used for conditioning the probability estimation of the current symbol? Rissanen <ref> [5] </ref> has addressed these and other questions in a rigorous framework and given answers for a special class of finite-state models named tree models. He also presents an asymptotically optimal algorithm named CONTEXT for encoding a given data sequence by adaptively constructing a suitable context model.

Reference-contexts: Coding techniques that can acheive rates close to the optimal are known <ref> [6] </ref>. In off-line applications, the data sequence x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m can be stored in memory and in principle, can be processed in any order whatsoever. Example applications that permit off-line computation include data archiving and distribution.

Reference-contexts: random variables X 1 ; X 2 ; : : : ; X m over a discrete alphabet A, the essential problem in lossless compression is to process the sequence in some order and assign a conditional probability mass function for the current event (symbol) based on previously processed symbols <ref> [7] </ref>. In on-line applications, the sequence x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m is processed in a sequential manner, with the symbol x i being encoded immediately before the symbol x i+1 .

Reference-contexts: It has been our experience that lossless image compression implementations that employ a raster scan, usually outperform those that scan the image along a Hilbert space filling curve. One could possibly explain this discrepancy by the fact that the context based predictive techniques usually employed for lossless image compression <ref> [8] </ref>, are inherently designed with respect to a raster scan and are difficult to extend in a natural and consistent manner to work in conjunction with a Hilbert scan. <p> Associated with each context C is a probability distribution p (xjC) that is used to encode pixel X j when its context is C. This pdf can be estimated by maintaining counts of symbol occurrences within each context (as in CALIC <ref> [8] </ref>) or by estimating the parameters of an assumed pdf (as in JPEG-LS [1]). Once we have efficient estimates for the pdf within each context, coding can be done efficiently.
