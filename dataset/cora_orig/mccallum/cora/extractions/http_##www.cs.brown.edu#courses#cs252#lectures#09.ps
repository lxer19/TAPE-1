Reference-contexts: Though we could also use a balanced search tree here, a better approach in this case is a heap. A priority search tree is a hybrid of a heap and a balanced search tree. They were discovered recently <ref> [1] </ref>, to be used for range queries where at least one of the sides of the range is unbounded.
