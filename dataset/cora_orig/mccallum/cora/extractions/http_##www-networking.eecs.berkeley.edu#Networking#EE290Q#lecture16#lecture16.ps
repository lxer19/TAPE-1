Reference-contexts: When we combine fE j g and f j g, it is clear that ~ E = f ( ~ E) = (E ( 1 ( ~ E); C 1 ); : : :; E ( J ( ~ E); C J )); (1) where f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> J !

[0; 1] J : By the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, this guarantees at least one solution (E 1 ; : : : ; E J ) to (1). 4.1 Mode of Distribution of a Single Link To answer the question of accuracy, we will analyze the case of a single link first. <p> = -r j2r where (B 1 ; : : : ; B J ) is any solution to X -r i2r ( C j if B j = 0 with B 1 ; : : : ; B J 2 [0; 1): The proof is as in Theorem 2.1 in <ref> [1] </ref>. We will sketch the proof here. Because (3) is a convex optimization problem, we can find a solution by using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a vector ~y which is a J-dimensional vector of multipliers. <p> The mode of distribution is approximated by ~x r . Then Corollary 3.3 in <ref> [1] </ref> states lim E ( N where n r (N ) is the number of route r calls on the N th network. <p> By using (7) and (8), the result that we achieve is L r (N ) ! 1 j2r Therefore, in the limiting regime, the blocking probabilities of different links are approximately independent. From Section 3 in <ref> [1] </ref>, we find that B j = E f ( j ; C j ); j = r:j2r Y i2rfjg (1 B i ); where E f (-; C) = max (1 C=-; 0): (9) The above three equations are equivalent to (6).
