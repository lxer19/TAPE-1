Title: Causal diagrams for empirical research  
Author: JUDEA PEARL

Affiliation: Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Computer Science Department, University of California,  
Abstract: The primary aim of this paper is to show how graphical models can be used as a mathematical language for integrating statistical and subject-matter information. In particular, the paper develops a principled, nonparametric framework for causal inference, in which diagrams are queried to determine if the assumptions available are sufficient for identifying causal effects from nonexperimental data. If so the diagrams can be queried to produce mathematical expressions for causal effects in terms of observed distributions; otherwise, the diagrams can be queried to suggest additional observations or auxiliary experiments from which the desired inferences can be obtained. Key words: Causal inference, graph models, structural equations, treatment effect.

Reference-contexts: While the added arc Z ! X permits us to calculate bounds on pr (yjx) (Robins, 1989, Sec. 1g; Manski, 1990) and the upper and lower bounds may even coincide for certain types of distributions pr (x; y; z) <ref> (Balke & Pearl, 1994) </ref>, there is no way of computing pr (yjx) for every positive distribution pr (x; y; z), as required by Definition 4. In general, the addition of arcs to a causal diagram can impede, but never assist, the identification of causal effects in nonparametric models.

Reference-contexts: In other words, we seek to estimate pr (x j jx i ) from a sample estimate of pr (V 0 ). The variables in V 0 nfX i ; X j g, are commonly known as concomitants <ref> (Cox, 1958, p. 48) </ref>. In observational studies, concomitants are used to reduce confounding bias due to spurious correlations between treatment and response.

Reference-contexts: X from Y , in G, written (X k Y jZ) G , iff Z blocks every path from a node in X to a node in Y . 2 It can be shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of conditional independencies, X k Y jZ <ref> (Dawid, 1979) </ref>, implied by the recursive decomposition of Eq. (2) and the set of triples (X; Z; Y ) that satisfy the d-separation criterion in G (Geiger et al., 1990). An alternative test for d-separation has been devised by Lauritzen et al. (1990), based on the notion of ancestral graphs.

Reference-contexts: The basic definition of causal effects in term of "wiping out" equations from the model (Definition 2) still carries over to nonrecursive systems (Strotz & Wold, 1960; Sobel, 1990), but then two issues must be addressed. First, the analysis of identification must ensure the stability of the remaining submodels <ref> (Fisher, 1970) </ref>. Secondly, the d-separation criterion for directed acyclic graphs must be extended to cover cyclic graphs as well. The validity of d-separation has been established for nonrecursive linear models and extended, using an augmented graph, to any arbitrary set of stable equations (Spirtes, 1994).

Reference-contexts: A related mathematical model, using event trees has been introduced by Robins (1986, pp. 1422-1425). Regardless of whether we represent interventions as a modification of an existing model as in Definition 2, or as a conditionalization in an augmented model <ref> (Pearl, 1993b) </ref>, the result is a well-defined transformation between the pre-intervention and the post-intervention distributions. <p> In this model, causal assumptions are expressed as independence constraints over the augmented probability function, as exemplified by Rosenbaum and Rubin's (1983) definitions of ignorability conditions. An alternative but related approach, still using the standard language of probability, is to define augmented probability functions over variables representing hypothetical interventions <ref> (Pearl, 1993b) </ref>. The language of structural models, which includes path diagrams (Wright, 1921) and structural equations (Goldberger, 1974) represents a drastic departure from these two approaches, because it invokes new primitives, such as arrows, disturbance terms, or plain causal statements, which have no parallels in the language of probability. <p> This can best be seen from the augmented diagram G 0 X , to which the intervention arcs F Z ! Z were added, where F z stands of the functions that determine Z in the structural equations <ref> (Pearl, 1993b) </ref>. If all backdoor paths from F Z to Y are blocked, the remaining paths from F Z to Y must go through the children of Z, hence these paths will be blocked by Z.

Reference-contexts: directed graph G represents a deterministic function X i = f i (pa i ; * i ); i = 1; :::; n (3) where pa i are the parents of variable X i in G, and * i ; 1 i n, are mutually independent, arbitrarily distributed random disturbances <ref> (Pearl & Verma, 1991) </ref>. These disturbance terms represent independent exogenous factors that the investigator chooses not to include in the analysis.

Reference-contexts: It is commonly believed that if a concomitant Z is affected by the treatment, then it must be excluded from the analysis of the total effect of the treatment <ref> (Pratt & Schlaifer, 1988) </ref>. The reason given for the exclusion is that the calculation of total effects amounts to integrating out Z, which is functionally equivalent to omitting Z to begin with.

Reference-contexts: Equation (6) represents the standard adjustment for concomitants Z when X is conditionally ignorable given Z <ref> (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) </ref>. Reducing ignorability conditions to the graphical criterion of Definition 3 replaces judgments about coun-terfactual dependencies with systematic procedures that can be applied to causal diagrams of any size and shape. <p> ancestor of Y . (iv) Diagrams (a) and (b) in Figure 6 contain no back-door paths between X and Y , and thus represent experimental designs in which there is no confounding bias between the treatment (X) and the response (Y ), i.e., X is strongly ignorable relative to Y <ref> (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) </ref>; hence, pr (yjx) = pr (yjx). Likewise, diagrams (c) and (d) in Figure 6 represent designs in which observed covariates, Z, block every back 16 door path between X and Y , i.e., X is conditionally ignorable given Z (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983); hence, pr (yjx) is <p> X is strongly ignorable relative to Y <ref> (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) </ref>; hence, pr (yjx) = pr (yjx). Likewise, diagrams (c) and (d) in Figure 6 represent designs in which observed covariates, Z, block every back 16 door path between X and Y , i.e., X is conditionally ignorable given Z (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983); hence, pr (yjx) is obtained by standard adjustment for Z, as in (6): pr (yjx) = z (v) For each of the diagrams in Figure 6, we can readily obtain a formula for pr (yjx), by using symbolic derivations patterned after those in Section 4.3.

Reference-contexts: Finally, a few comments regarding the notation introduced in this paper. There have been three approaches to expressing causal assumptions in mathematical form. The most common approach in the statistical literature invokes the Rubin's model <ref> (Rubin, 1974) </ref> in which probability functions are defined over an augmented space of observable and counterfactual variables. In this model, causal assumptions are expressed as independence constraints over the augmented probability function, as exemplified by Rosenbaum and Rubin's (1983) definitions of ignorability conditions.

The validity of d-separation has been established for nonrecursive linear models and extended, using an augmented graph, to any arbitrary set of stable equations <ref> (Spirtes, 1994) </ref>. However, the computation of causal effect estimands will be harder in cyclic networks, because symbolic reduction of pr (yjx) to 19 hat-free expressions may require the solution of nonlinear equations. Finally, a few comments regarding the notation introduced in this paper.

Consider an experiment in which soil fumigants (X) are used to increase oat crop yields (Y ) by controlling the eelworm population (Z) but may also have direct effects, both beneficial and adverse, on yields beside the control of eelworms.
