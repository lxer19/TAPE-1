Abstract: Path planning with multiple objectives is investigated for terrain navigation. Most path planners are designed to generate a single path that is optimal in terms of some criterion such as path length or path travel time. Realistically, however, a path is considered feasible if it satisfies multiple criteria such as safety, expected time required to traverse the path, energy consumption to move along the path. A path that is optimal with respect to a single criterion may not necessarily satisfy other criteria at the same time. In this paper, we investigate how to find a set of paths (as opposed to a single path) so as to permit various choices concerning multiple criteria. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and an extension to navigation in time-varying scenes is discussed.

Reference-contexts: However, the path may lead into a local minimum depending on the shapes of the obstacles, at which point the vehicle on the path does not make any progress toward the goal point. Methods using the Voronoi diagram [14] and skeletons <ref> [1] </ref> also keep the vehicle away from the obstacles. On the other hand, a path generated by the visibility graph [9] is known to be shortest and consists of vertex-to-vertex motions.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we consider an extension of our approach to a time-varying environment. We consider the case in which the environment contains some obstacles whose locations change over time along known trajectories. The problem of path planning among moving obstacles has been approached by a variety of methods <ref> [3, 4, 6, 10] </ref>. Earlier in Section 1, we stated that shortest paths and fastest paths are usually different in a time-varying environment. We note that there is a dependency between fastest paths and other paths in a time-varying environment. <p> See [4] for details. After finding a path, we can postprocess the path by using, say, the method of <ref> [3] </ref> to produce a path satisfying its physical constraints such as acceleration limits. 5 Conclusions We have considered a path planning approach that is suitable when the user has multiple criteria for path selection and wishes to choose an acceptable path from a set of candidate paths.

Reference-contexts: The presented search algorithm is capable of satisfy this requirement. As a natural consequence, its processing time is multiple times slower than search algorithms for a single objective. The queue size will limit the range of applications. A method using a hierarchical search <ref> [5] </ref> may have to be used to speed up the approach. Acknowledgements.

Reference-contexts: A popular approach for navigation in an obstacle-cluttered environment is the potential field approach <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. In this approach, the path is determined by repulsive forces received from the obstacles and attractive force from the destination point. The path tends to pass through the valley of potential field, thus the path produced is in general considered 5 as safe.

Reference-contexts: Path i is the shortest among paths whose energy consumption is equal to or earlier than that of i . 5. The list is maximal to satisfy the above conditions. This notion plays an important role in multiobjective search <ref> [12] </ref>. It should be clear that with this ordering it is relatively simple to answer queries such as 1.

The primary difference between our method and the approaches mentioned above is that our method generates a group of paths as opposed to a single path.
