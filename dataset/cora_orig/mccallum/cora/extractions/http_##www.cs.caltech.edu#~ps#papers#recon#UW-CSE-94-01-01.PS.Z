Abstract: We present a general method for automatic reconstruction of accurate, concise, piecewise smooth surface models from scattered range data. The method can be used in a variety of applications such as reverse engineering, that is, the construction of CAD models from physical objects. Novel aspects of the method are its ability to model surfaces of arbitrary topological type and to recover sharp features such as creases and corners. The method has proven to be effective, as demonstrated by a number of examples using both simulated and real data. A key ingredient in the method, and a principal contribution of this paper, is the introduction of a new class of piecewise smooth surface representations based on subdivision. These surfaces have a number of properties that make them ideal for use in surface reconstruction: they are simple to implement, they can model sharp features concisely, and they can be fit to scattered range data using an unconstrained optimization procedure.

Our surface representation is a generalization of the subdivision surface scheme introduced by Loop [12]. <p> A number of examples, shown in the Color Plates, are discussed in Section 5. 2 Background on subdivision surfaces A subdivision surface is defined by repeatedly refining an initial control mesh as indicated in Color Plates 1a-1d. The first and most popular subdivision surface schemes, introduced by Doo/Sabin <ref> [6] </ref> and Catmull/Clark [3], are based on quadrilateral meshes, and generalize biquadratic and bicubic tensor product B-splines, respectively. A subdivision scheme based on triangles is most convenient for our purposes. <p> The matrix S n is called the local subdivision matrix <ref> [6, 9] </ref>. As r ! 1, each point v r approaches a point on the limit surface. Equation 2 suggests that the limit point can be obtained by an eigenanalysis of the local subdivision matrix.

Reference-contexts: The most popular smooth surface representations are tensor product NURBS. However, NURBS can only represent surfaces of arbitrary topological type by partitioning the model into a collection of individual NURBS patches. Adjacent patches must then be explicitly stitched together using geometric continuity conditions <ref> [7] </ref>. A large number of parameters (the B-spline coefficients) are therefore introduced, most of which are constrained by the continuity conditions. As a consequence, fitting NURBS surfaces in general requires high-dimensional constrained optimization. Subdivision surfaces, first introduced by Doo/Sabin [6] and Catmull/Clark [3], offer a promising alternative.

Reference-contexts: The matrix S n is called the local subdivision matrix <ref> [6, 9] </ref>. As r ! 1, each point v r approaches a point on the limit surface. Equation 2 suggests that the limit point can be obtained by an eigenanalysis of the local subdivision matrix. <p> The matrix S n is called the local subdivision matrix [6, 9]. As r ! 1, each point v r approaches a point on the limit surface. Equation 2 suggests that the limit point can be obtained by an eigenanalysis of the local subdivision matrix. Indeed, Halstead et al. <ref> [9] </ref> show that the limit point can be expressed as an affine combination of the initial vertex positions: v 1 = 1 + ` n+1 v 0 ` 1 + ` 2 + ` n+1 where (` 1 ; :::; ` n+1 ) is the dominant left eigenvector of S n <p> This affine combination can be expressed as a limit mask as shown in Figure 2, where !(n) = 3n 8a (n) . Eigenanalysis of the local subdivision matrix can also be used to establish smoothness. Using the results of Halstead et al. <ref> [9] </ref>, it can be shown that Loop's surfaces are indeed tangent plane continuous. <p> The tangent masks are again determined by the left eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues (a proof of this statement requires an extension to the analysis of Halstead et al. <ref> [9] </ref>). One of these left eigenvectors is (0; 1; 1; 0; :::; 0), which again is consistent with the fact that the crease is a uniform cubic B-spline.

Mesh optimization <ref> [4, 11] </ref>: Starting with the output of phase 1, phase 2 reduces the number of triangles and improves the fit to the data (Color Plate 1h). <p> The goal is to find the tagged mesh in S that minimizes E. The reader familiar with Hoppe et al. <ref> [11] </ref> will notice the absence of a "spring energy" term, which was introduced as a regularizing term to guide the mesh optimization algorithm into a good local energy well. <p> Empirically we have found that the regularization term is unnecessary in phase 3. 4.2 Minimization of the energy function Our algorithm for energy minimization closely parallels the one presented in Hoppe et al. <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> For fixed Y = (y 1 ; ; y n ), optimize E dist over V . Step 2, which is a sparse linear least squares problem, can be solved as described in Hoppe et al. <ref> [11] </ref>. Step 1, the computation of the vectors y i , is equivalent to root finding, and can be done only approximately. We use the following scheme employing the intermediate piecewise linear meshes converging to S (K;L;V ) . <p> Then the approximate projection of x i is given by y i = ffd a + fid b + fld c : 4.2.2 Optimization over (K; L) Our algorithm for solving the outer minimization problem, minimizing E (K; L), again closely parallels the algorithm of Hoppe et al. <ref> [11] </ref>. We define a set of four elementary transformations, edge collapse, edge swap, edge split , and edge tag, taking a tagged simplicial complex (K; L) to another tagged simplicial complex (K 0 ; L 0 ) (see Figure 5). The first three transformations are discussed in Hoppe et al. [11], <p> <ref> [11] </ref>. We define a set of four elementary transformations, edge collapse, edge swap, edge split , and edge tag, taking a tagged simplicial complex (K; L) to another tagged simplicial complex (K 0 ; L 0 ) (see Figure 5). The first three transformations are discussed in Hoppe et al. [11], while the fourth is a toggle which either adds an edge to the set L of sharp edges, or removes one from it. These transformations are complete in the sense that they form a transitive set of transformations on the set of tagged simplicial complexes. <p> A legal move is the application of one of these elementary transformations to an edge of K that leaves the topological type of K unchanged. The criterion for determining a legal move is given in Hoppe et al. <ref> [11] </ref>. Our goal is to find a sequence of legal moves taking us from an initial tagged simplicial complex (K 0 ; L 0 ) to one on which a minimum of E is achieved.
