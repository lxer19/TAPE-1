Abstract: Technical Report #96-14 January, 1996 Abstract One of the central issues in the control of articulated limbs is the specification of dynamically feasible trajectories. We present a total energy method which treats the manipulator as a perturbed Hamiltonian system. A harmonic potential field is employed which precludes the existence of local minima. In addition, for a dynamically compensated mechanism, the phase space structure of a manipulator "copies" the critical point structure of the harmonic potential. This result is used in conjunction with harmonic potentials to generate and control repetitive motion plans for a manipulator. In addition, control derived from harmonic potential fields result in bounded-torque controllers and produces compliant, collision-free kinodynamic behavior. The energy-referenced control scheme is applied to a bipedal walking gait. We conclude the chapter with a brief discussion of a recent neurophysiological model that postulates a role for the basal ganglia as a potential-based motor planning mechanism.

In general, the approach presented here converges to approximately constant energy orbits when released from an initial state with non-zero potential.

Reference-contexts: It seems natural to ask whether it is physiologically plausible for some neural process to exploit these phenomena for motor planning. Some recent speculations on the function of the basal ganglia <ref> [16] </ref> suggest that these nuclei are involved in associating sensory cues and environmental context with an appropriate action or goal. Basal ganglia involvement in motor planning is strongly suggested by the symptoms of Parkinson's (e.g., festination, akinesia) and Huntington's diseases (e.g., chorea). <p> In addition, because of the uniqueness properties of Laplace's equation, there is a one-to-one mapping between a given context (e.g., environment map), and the potential in the resistive network.

In general, the approach presented here converges to approximately constant energy orbits when released from an initial state with non-zero potential. The "energy reference" concept described here is likewise an attempt to control the system such that the system's total energy is conserved.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to search techniques, potential field methods can be used to formulate "total energy" methods for planning motion. The use of a constant-energy constraint for control has been explored for hopping and juggling robots <ref> [34, 14, 33] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Angle-angle diagrams are helpful in evaluating and comparing gaits. Besides hip and knee angle-angle diagrams, knee and ankle diagrams are often used. The usefulness of angle-angle diagrams for therapeutic means is noted by <ref> [35] </ref>. 4.4 Energy-Referenced Control In the examples included in this section, the boundaries are configured as shown in Figure 8. The dark regions represent obstacles assigned a potential of 1. These obstacles represent the joint angle limits of the leg. The grey squares represent goals assigned a potential of 0.

Reference-contexts: Each of the three links is characterized by a point mass located at the center of mass, a rotational moment of inertia, and associated geometry. These parameters are defined as those of the subject used in the walking trial example found in <ref> [39] </ref>. The mass moments of inertia were calculated using the data for the radius of gyration specified in [39]. Note that values for the location of the center of mass are the lengths from the proximal end of each segment. <p> These parameters are defined as those of the subject used in the walking trial example found in <ref> [39] </ref>.

The two angle-angle diagrams give the general impression that both share a similar pattern of motion. Both execute a stable, cyclic motion pattern with the characteristic dip during the stance phase, and both orbits cover a similar area.

Reference-contexts: A passive joint moment arises from the deformation of all these tissues. Our technique for including the elastic moments about the hip and the knee in our model was to use actual measurements of such moments from in vivo human joints <ref> [40, 28] </ref>. Exponential functions were then fitted to this experimental data. These functions show the relationship that the average passive hip and knee moment has to its respective joint angle. Clearly as a joint nears its respective limit, the passive elastic moment increases greatly.
