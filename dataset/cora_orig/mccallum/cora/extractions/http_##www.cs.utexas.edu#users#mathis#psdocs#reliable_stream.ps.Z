Abstract: Providing reliable stream transmission in the IP-based mobile computing environment is a major difficulty in the development of a practical mobile Internet system [B3C94], [MS93], [I93]. In this paper, we propose a protocol for the reliable stream transmission in the mobile computing environment. By caching packets passing through the base station, we can not only establish the connection of the reliable stream transmission between the mobile host and its partner in the Internet, but can also guarantee the normal behavior of the TCP protocol in the Internet. Minimizing the computational overhead of the packet interception at the base stations is another effort in the paper. We are expecting that the overall communication performance is going to be improved, although the caching overhead exists at the base station, as indicated by the mathematical model in the paper.

In <ref> [CDJM91] </ref>, the author collected the TCP/IP packet headers from the University of Southern California at Berkeley, and Bellcore networks during October, 1989.

So the average performance is actually improved, not aggravated compared to a with the base station without packet caching. 5.0 Conclusion and Future Work The combination of the TCP and the MTCP attains a feasible solution to support the reliable stream transmission in the IP-based mobile computing environment.

Reference-contexts: 1.0 Introduction In 1991, an IP-based protocol for mobile internetworking <ref> [IDM91] </ref> was proposed.

Frequent disconnection, noise and Interference, and low bandwidth <ref> [X94] </ref> will seriously impact the performance of the TCP in the mobile cell, even the TCP completely does not work in the mobile cells. 2.3 Separating the Mobile Cells from the Internet The preceding analysis of the approaches of the reliable stream transmission leads us to conclude the necessity of isolating <p> Secondly, the base station is the last hop for a packet to reach a mobile host, so we can easily develop a new protocol in the mobile cell to fit in the specific situations in the mobile cells without impacting the performance of the Internet <ref> [X94] </ref>. In the next chapter, we will introduce packet caching at the base station as a solution to the reliable stream transmission in the mobile computing environment, and indicate that it can obtain an optimized performance in the mobile Internet. <p> Surprisingly, the packet caching not only can solve the reliable stream transmission problem in the mobile computing environment, but also introduces a great benefit <ref> [X94] </ref>: lower packet loss rate between a mobile host and its partner in the mobile Internet. <p> However, the packet loss rate will reduce to max (L1, L2) if we utilize packet caching at the base station. Because there exists no data sharing in the case of packet caching, the following two mathematical models are obtained from the two given in <ref> [X94] </ref> 1 by ignoring the data sharing parameter: Where D denotes the improvement of the communication latency with data caching at the base station compared with the communication latency without data caching. <p> T denotes the improvement of the traffic load with data caching. n denotes The number of intermediate nodes between BS and Server (including Server). l1, l2 denote the packet loss rates in the Internet and in the mobile cells respectively. o denotes the rate of communication latency, .
