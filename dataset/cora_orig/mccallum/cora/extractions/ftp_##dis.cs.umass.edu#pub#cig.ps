Title: Cooperative Information Gathering: A Distributed Problem Solving Approach

Abstract: We contrast two approaches to the problem of information gathering that may be characterized as distributed processing and distributed problem solving. The former is characteristic of most existing information gathering systems, while the latter is central to research in multi-agent systems. We examine features of complex information carrying environments and the information gathering task that demonstrate both the utility of viewing information gathering as distributed problem solving and difficulties with viewing it as distributed processing. We propose a new approach to information gathering based on the distributed problem solving paradigm and its attendant body of research in multi-agent systems and distributed artificial intelligence. This approach, called Cooperative Information Gathering, involves concurrent, asynchronous discovery and composition of information spread across a network of information servers. Top level queries drive the creation of partially elaborated information gathering plans, resulting in the employment of multiple semi-autonomous, cooperative agents for the purpose of achieving goals and subgoals within those plans. The system as a whole satisfices, trading off solution quality and search cost while respecting user-imposed deadlines. We also survey current work on distributed and agent-based approaches to information gathering.

Reference-contexts: Simply charging ahead blindly, stopping the search when resources have been exhausted is likely to lead to very poor results. Planned activity under time and resource constrained situations is a hard problem needing sophisticated, knowledge-intensive techniques <ref> [1, 22, 56, 57] </ref>. Many questions need to be addressed about the efficient usage of resources.

Reference-contexts: This communication step may alter agent behavior, but it does not represent the exploitation of constraints derived from the interdependencies of dynamically generated partial results. A system that uses this approach is the distributed version of INQUERY <ref> [3, 4] </ref> (to be discussed later), where the set of statistics used to compute globally comparable relevance rankings is obtained by pooling statistics from all corpora that will be searched. After the initial computation and communication, retrieval at the various sites proceeds independently and in isolation. <p> However, the kind of domain specificity they exploit in their content-based search algorithms and resource discovery engines is weak domain knowledge like file types, gross syntactic and structural features of documents, or keyword based attribute extraction. IG, however, is potentially very knowledge intensive. Distribution of the INQUERY system <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, on the other hand, is concerned with performance in searching distributed text corpora. The approach to Distributed IR currently planned for the INQUERY system (as with most other IR systems attacking the problem of distribution) clearly falls under the distributed processing rubric.

Reference-contexts: Also, it may be the case that a solution or partial solution generated by one agent may facilitate (i.e. serve to focus or constrain) the problem solving of another agent and thereby reduce the amount of computation required <ref> [12] </ref>. The problem solving process of one agent in some way assists another agent in its problem solving, perhaps by making the other agent more certain of its local solution or by restricting the space of potential solutions that must be considered. <p> We now briefly review a few implemented aspects of the FA/C paradigm that have direct relevance to the CIG task.

Reference-contexts: In response to a query, multiple semi-autonomous agents can be released to search the distributed "information space" in a cooperative manner for relevant items. A multi-agent approach to information gathering is promising for a variety of reasons <ref> [16] </ref>: * One advantage of multi-agent systems is concurrency, which is important in time constrained situations or when the search space is very large, as is the case with networked information gathering. Query plans can often be decomposed into relatively independent sub-plans with few interdependencies. <p> This results in the formation of a search organization for the purpose of satisfying a query <ref> [16] </ref>. Intelligent servers that receive queries and act as regional planning sites, either further decomposing the search into subregions or sending 3 agents to local corpora for data retrieval. <p> Cooperating to enhance efficiency of a resource-limited information acquisition process or negotiating to dynamically resolve conflicts and inconsistencies in the acquired data, leading to further search or retrieval, may be important aspects of IG systems in the future. Only recently, Decker et al. <ref> [16] </ref>, Decker and Sycara [17], Birmingham et al. [18], Davies and Edwards [10], Foner [21], Kuokka and Harada [32], and Karakoulas and Ferguson [27] have started making some early but promising forays in this direction.

The MACRON architecture [16] is being designed as an instantiation of the principles of CIG. It incorporates capabilities to exploit subproblem interdependencies, manage the uncertainty inherent in multi-agent search, intelligently trade-off solution quality for resource limitations, and either exploit or avoid redundancy as needed. <p> From an organization point of view, the agents in MACRON form a matrix organization <ref> [16] </ref> where the interface agents transform a query and pass it on to functional units that comprise sets of DECAF agents that specialize in dealing with particular types of information resources. Agents in a functional unit in turn schedule low level retrieval tasks and delegate them to the retrieval agents.

User queries are delegated to specialized task agents that in turn could communicate with information gathering agents as a part of their task execution. An information gathering agent has a planner that instantiates task structures, a scheduler and an execution monitor.

Reference-contexts: This process can be viewed as dynamically interwoven phases of problem decomposition, problem solving, and solution synthesis <ref> [19, 33] </ref>. As stated previously, distributed processing is characterized by complete independence of subproblems. Agents need nothing other than local information to arrive at a subproblem solution of the required quality that can be synthesized with other agent subproblem solutions to arrive at a global 5 solution.

Meta-knowledge is kept (learned and updated) by each user on the network and is a 4-tuple of the form [U ser1; U ser2; Keyword; CertaintyF actor].

Reference-contexts: Resource bounds for agents are made explicit within Telescript, facilitating the use of satisficing search. The Java programming language is another technology that may be very important in the implementation of future CIG systems <ref> [25] </ref>. Java allows applets, such as intelligent information retrieval agents, to be transferred between machines on the Internet, much as Telescript agents travel between electronic places.

These systems are guided by task-level requirements, rather than just the syntax of the queries, to establish an association with and retrieve information from the stored structures to which they have access [43].

Reference-contexts: Kirk et al. describe the Information Manifold (IM), an IIR system whose architecture is based on a rich domain model that allows the semantic content and the physical properties of information sources to be described and queried <ref> [28] </ref>. The IM's representation language is based on Horn rules. The authors show that within their language, it is possible to efficiently and completely determine the set of relevant information sources for a given query.

Knoblock and Arens <ref> [29] </ref> discuss an architecture for information gathering agents that is 21 the closest in spirit to our approach.

Reference-contexts: The level of uncertainty is used to order the search process (best first) and is updated as the data sources themselves change. However, information gathering can exploit more than just relevance knowledge. Knoblock and Levy <ref> [30] </ref> seek to improve the efficiency of information retrieval from large numbers of distributed databases by taking advantage of information that is only available at run-time.

Reference-contexts: Agents can use other agents to provide abstractions of heterogeneous information sources. In addition, passive data sources like databases can be transformed into information providing agents by wrapping them with intelligent interfaces <ref> [31] </ref>, making possible negotiation processes between retrieval agents and intelligent search engines. Cooperation between agents implies management of interdependencies between their activities so as to integrate and evolve consistent clusters of high quality information from distributed heterogeneous sources.

Reference-contexts: Only recently, Decker et al. [16], Decker and Sycara [17], Birmingham et al. [18], Davies and Edwards [10], Foner [21], Kuokka and Harada <ref> [32] </ref>, and Karakoulas and Ferguson [27] have started making some early but promising forays in this direction. The MACRON architecture [16] is being designed as an instantiation of the principles of CIG. <p> Given some measure of similarity between needs, agents can perform a type of gradient ascent by iteratively joining clumps whose information needs are most similar to their own and communicating with their new neighbors. Kuokka and Harada <ref> [32] </ref> take a more centralized approach in which information producers and consumers advertise their needs to an intelligent "matchmaking" service.

Reference-contexts: This process can be viewed as dynamically interwoven phases of problem decomposition, problem solving, and solution synthesis <ref> [19, 33] </ref>. As stated previously, distributed processing is characterized by complete independence of subproblems. Agents need nothing other than local information to arrive at a subproblem solution of the required quality that can be synthesized with other agent subproblem solutions to arrive at a global 5 solution. <p> These abilities critically affect, both qualitatively and quantitatively, aspects of local planning decisions for problem solving control. The process of distributed problem solving is described in <ref> [33] </ref> as taking place in four stages: problem formulation, focus-of-attention, allocation, and achievement (see Figure 6 which has been slightly modified from [33]). The discussion of goal trees up to this point has treated them as static structures. <p> These abilities critically affect, both qualitatively and quantitatively, aspects of local planning decisions for problem solving control.

Reference-contexts: That is, agents can exploit the interdependencies between subproblems to their benefit. This is the essence of the functionally accurate, cooperative (FA/C) paradigm presented by Lesser et al. <ref> [37, 39] </ref> as an approach to distributed problem solving. In FA/C systems, the interdependencies among subproblems motivate agents to augment their local information with information about global problem solving activity in order to enhance the efficiency of the ongoing problem solving process. <p> These methods have evolved over more than a decade, since the time the FA/C paradigm was first proposed <ref> [37] </ref>. Below, we discuss various techniques and systems from MAS that may have direct bearing on CIG viewed as a DPS task.

Reference-contexts: For any given query, rather 15 than performing an exhaustive search, one must attempt to locate the "best" response possible given time and resource constraints. That is, the information gathering process must be satisficing along various dimensions like precision, quality, etc <ref> [38] </ref>. As a motivating example, consider Figure 1 above. A user has access to multiple networks, each of which contains its own data sources, information servers, and servers devoted to computation. The links to each of the networks may have different bandwidths, reliability, and costs of usage.

Figure 3 (from <ref> [39] </ref>) shows an example of such a goal tree. Solutions to high-level sibling goals, like G k1 and G k , or more distant goals, like G 1;1 and G k;2 , can have constraints between them. <p> Each of the agents can model only a part of the global goal structure based on its role in the overall problem solving process. This increases the complexity of the situation discussed above. Figure 5 (from <ref> [39] </ref>) illustrates an example where the goal tree from Figure 3 is distributed across two agents. Detection of coordination relationships by the agents now becomes more difficult due to their partial view of the goal tree. between two agents.

Reference-contexts: The goal interrelationships can be of various types such as facilitates, enables, overlaps, hinders, favors, and so on <ref> [11, 14, 40] </ref> (these interrelationships will be discussed in detail later). In terms of our goal representation, a facilitates interrelationship implies that the values of a solution output parameter of the facilitating goal can, in some way, determine an optional goal specification parameter of the facilitated goal. <p> We now briefly review a few implemented aspects of the FA/C paradigm that have direct relevance to the CIG task. Decker and Lesser [11, 12, 14] provide detailed studies of quantitative trade-offs involved in explicit recognition and exploitation of task interrelationships for use in multi-agent coordination. Von Martial's work <ref> [40] </ref> on coordination in multi-agent planning, which uses favors goal interrelationships and temporal interactions, is also relevant here. Garvey and Lesser [22] discuss design-to-time algorithms which basically endow the local problem solver with abilities to deal with real-time considerations and goal interdependencies.

Our multi-agent Case Based Reasoning system based on Negotiated Retrieval is another example of a sophisticated system exploiting constraints generated by sharing results of a partial search <ref> [41] </ref>. More specifically, a response to a query involves assembling related pieces of information from different case bases to form a composite case.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, strong interdependencies between subproblems are indicative of distributed problem solving. 6 3 Intelligent Information Retrieval Recent trends in information retrieval show an evolution from relatively syntax-oriented retrieval systems to more semantically guided systems <ref> [26, 43, 51] </ref> known as Intelligent Information Retrieval (IIR) systems. These systems are guided by task-level requirements, rather than just the syntax of the queries, to establish an association with and retrieve information from the stored structures to which they have access [43]. <p> These systems are guided by task-level requirements, rather than just the syntax of the queries, to establish an association with and retrieve information from the stored structures to which they have access <ref> [43] </ref>. In this report we go a step further and propose a model for Cooperative Information Gathering (CIG), where a group of potentially heterogeneous IIR agents are involved in simultaneous access and composition of associated information spread across a network of information servers. <p> Consider another example from [45]: "find a mechanism that converts a uniform rotary motion into a reciprocation in Atrobelovsky's design encyclopedia." The retrieval mechanism here should have a model of kinematic mechanisms. Simple keyword-based systems cannot handle such queries. Most of the models for IIR presented in the literature <ref> [43, 51] </ref> can be conceptually captured by the abstract models shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a shows an intelligent information system where an "inference shell" is wrapped around the data repository. We will apply the term information server to this combination of an inference engine and a data repository. <p> This approach acknowledges the importance of partial results in focusing the search for information that is central to the CIG model. However, the information retrieval process, including the use of partial results, occurs within a single centralized query planner. 5.2 Intelligent Information Retrieval Ram and Hunter <ref> [43] </ref> take the view that content-based IIR, as opposed to syntax-based IR, requires inference, leading to a combinatorial explosion of potential inferences. Since computational resources are limited, some method of controlling inference must be employed.

Reference-contexts: There are also modules for planning, executing and presenting the results of queries. Although centralized and described in terms of modules, this architecture is very similar to distributed agent-based architectures described in Section 5.3. Rissland and Daniels <ref> [44] </ref> outline an approach to IR that makes use of more knowledge-intensive methods developed within the framework of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). CBR systems excel at retrieval of highly relevant cases and symbolic reasoning about problem cases. However, they typically have small case bases.
