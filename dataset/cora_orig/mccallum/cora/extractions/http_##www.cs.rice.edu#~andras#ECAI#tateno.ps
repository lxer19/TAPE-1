Abstract: This paper depicts an optimal method to construct a lexical transducer for Japanese by describing the stems and suffixes in different lexicons separately and adding an extra level of the transducers for transducing between canonical citation forms and stem-suffix style forms. This method makes it possible to reduce the complexity of rule descriptions and the computational load of intersecting compared with other methods. We made the full-size lexical transducer for Japanese. The number of states is about 60 thousand and the number of arcs is about 300 thousands. The physical size is from 800KB to 1.5MB depending on compaction methods.

Another problem is the complexity of descriptions of the rules. <p> The transducers which maps stem-suffix forms to canonical citation forms and vice versa are necessary. The transducers have extremely simple structures and are almost independent of each other. This property of the transducers is advantageous to execute the Intersecting Composition described in <ref> [2] </ref>. As described in Section 1, Karttunen proposed moving descriptions of idiosyncratic alternation rules into the source lexicons in order to reduce the complexity of the descriptions of morphological alternations. <p> There are about one hundred and fifty transducers in this group. A canonical citation form with the morphological category is transduced into its stem-suffix style form with the morphological category and a tag for the suffix by one of the transducers. As Karttunen proposed <ref> [2] </ref>, these transducers are not intersected but composed with the stem-suffix lexicons one by one (Intersecting Composition). The standard Intersecting Composition is executed by referring the surface side of the lexicon to find the places to compose.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION A Lexical Transducer (LT) is defined by Karttunen, Kaplan, Zaenen <ref> [3] </ref>. It is a specialized finite-state transducer (FST) that maps canonical citation forms of words and their morphological categories to inflected surface forms, and vice versa. An LT has the following advantages: 1. <p> The computational speed of the morphological process (anal ysis and generation) is faster and the data for the process can be compacted more tightly, compared with other meth ods. The standard way to construct an LT shown by <ref> [3] </ref> consists of three steps: 1. Constructing a simple finite-state source lexicon (LA) which defines all valid canonical citation forms of the language. 2. Describing morphological alternations by means of two-level rules [5], compiling the rules to FST's, and intersecting them to form a single rule transducer (RT). 3. <p> The number of states is about 60 thousand and the number of arcs is about 300 thousands. The physical size is from 800KB to 1.5MB depending on compaction methods. This success of the optimal way to construct the LT for Japanese emphasizes the idea pointed out by <ref> [3] </ref> that an extra level of the transducers is both practical and linguistically motivated. Transducers between the canonical citation forms and the stem-suffix forms in Japanese are typical one of such examples.

Reference-contexts: In our method, the intersecting composition is executed by referring the lexical side. stem-suffix style forms Phonological rules can describe the alternations in the specific sequence of the phonemes in the entire lexicons ([1], <ref> [4] </ref>). It is not necessary to specify the place where the morphological alternation occurs, while each of them just specifies one alternation surrounded by other phonemes that may alter in other rules. It is possible to write rules for the alternations in a specific sequence in the lexicons.
