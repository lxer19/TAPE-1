Abstract: This panel will explore an interaction paradigm for co-present computer-based collaboration we term Single Display Groupware (SDG). SDG is a class of applications that support multiple simultaneous users interacting in a copresent environment on a single shared display with multiple input-devices. SDG are being used in various applications in the educational, entertainment and research communities, but many issues remain to be explored.

Reference-contexts: Finally, I contend that we may be limiting ourselves by trying to force the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, and pointers) user interface metaphor to function in a multiuser paradigm. Exploring alternative approaches, such as tool based architectures <ref> [1] </ref>, may lead to applications that are better suited for simultaneous use by multiple users. Jason Stewart is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of New Mexico.

Reference-contexts: Her dissertation research focused on human-computer interaction issues for children's use of computers in educational environments, focusing on supporting children's copresent collaboration. Lauren Bricker I will present some of the activities implemented with Colt, a system that was developed as part of my doctoral research <ref> [ 3] </ref>. These activities will showcase a class of objects called Cooperatively Controlled Objects (CCOs). CCOs are designed to support simultaneous influences from two or more users on one or more machines. <p> CCOs are designed to support simultaneous influences from two or more users on one or more machines. Furthermore, the degree to which the users must simultaneously manipulate a CCO may increase the amount and type of communication between the users <ref> [ 3] </ref>. CCOs can be employed to encourage users to focus on a task, a property that is especially beneficial when working with students. Developing applications to support objects such as CCOs involves special challenges.

Reference-contexts: Jason Stewart I became convinced that technological support for co-present collaboration was an important and necessary research project while helping design and test single user applications in elementary school classrooms <ref> [4] </ref>. Kids wanted to be in control of the application. Having only a single input device was an irritating and artificial bottleneck to them.

Reference-contexts: POSITION STATEMENTS Kori Inkpen I will present observations and empirical findings from my doctoral research <ref> [ 6] </ref>, which provides a strong motivation for exploration of SDG.

Reference-contexts: The results of this study showed that the children were more motivated to play and were more successful in the game when playing together on a single machine than in either of the other two conditions <ref> [ 7] </ref>. While playing together on a single machine was the most effective configuration in the previous study, sharing the mouse was often problematic. In a follow-up study, the computer was adapted to accept inputs from two mice.

Reference-contexts: We therefore developed a new set of interaction techniques to more effectively support SDG. These interaction techniques are implemented as part of the Amulet toolkit <ref> [ 9] </ref>, by changing the behavior objects (called Interactors), the widgets, and the command objects to have a UserID field that can be used to control how they are shared.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, attention to the usability of SDG applications becomes foremost in their design. In the panel, I will share lessons learned from my experiences leading the iterative design and testing of KidPad, a SDG drawing program <ref> [10] </ref>. When designing SDG applications one must be aware of tradeoffs between functionality in the application and effective collaboration between partners. Because support of collaboration is often the primary goal, functionality may have to be sacrificed when it hinders collaboration.
