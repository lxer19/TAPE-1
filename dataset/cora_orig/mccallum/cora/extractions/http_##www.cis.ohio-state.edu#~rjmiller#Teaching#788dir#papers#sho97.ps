Title: OLAP and Statistical Databases: Similarities and Differences  
Author: Arie Shoshani 
Address: Berkeley, California 94720  
Affiliation: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  
Abstract: 1 A shortened version of this paper is published in ACM TODS 1997 Abstract During the 1980's there was a lot of activity in the area of Statistical Databases, focusing mostly on socioeconomic type applications, such as census data, national production and consumption patterns, etc. In the 1990's the area of OnLine-Analytic Processing (OLAP) was introduced for the analysis of transaction based business data, such as retail stores transactions. Both areas deal with the representation and support of data in a multidimensional space. Much of the OLAP literature does not refer to the Statistical Database literature, perhaps because the connection between analyzing business data and socioeconomic data is not obvious. Furthermore, there are papers published in one area or the other whose results can be applied in both application areas. In this paper, we compare the work done in these two areas. We discuss concepts used in the conceptual modeling of the data and operations over them, efficient physical organization and access methods, as well as privaccy issues. We point out the terminology used and the correspondence between terms. We identify which research aspects are emphasized in each of these areas and the reasons for that. We conclude by arguing for the support of a Statistical Object data type as one of the fundamental structures that objectoriented data models and systems should support.

Database systems provide only simple aggregation functions (usually only count, sum, average, maximum, minimum).

Reference-contexts: This graphical representation is used in OLAP papers (e.g. [GB+96]) and multidimensional OLAP products (e.g. <ref> [ArborSoft] </ref>) since it is very useful in presenting the concept of the multidimensional space. Obviously, this representation is intended to be used only to convey concepts. It cannot be used for real databases for display of the schema or for display of the data. <p> Thus, instead of storing all the columns of the tabular representation, we need to store the distinct values of each dimensions only once. An example is shown in Figure 20.

We discuss this issue in this section because much of the debate is based on physical organization of the data cube, and the efficiency of access. Below are the main arguments made by each.

Reference-contexts: We compare concepts and show the equivalence in terminology used in each area. 4.1. Graph models In the SDB area it was recognized early on that a conceptual model should avoid the limitations of the 2-D tabular representation of a statistical dataset <ref> [CS81] </ref>. The graph model, shown in Figure 3 for the 2-D table of Figure 1, shows the elements of the graph model.

Reference-contexts: When knowledge exists on the access patterns to the data cube (typical queries), a non-symmetric partitioning approach can further improve performance. The analysis of which subcubes to form can be quite complex, and an index of the dimensions of the various subcubes has to be created and maintained. In <ref> [CD+95] </ref> such an approach was used for climate modeling spatio-temporal data. In this case the data set was only 4 dimensional, yet the analysis of which subcubes to form was shown to be NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: This problem is referred to as the statistical inference problem. There was a lot of work done in this area in the 1980; many references can be found in [S82]. However, it is worth mentioning here an important negative result described in <ref> [DS80] </ref>. In this paper it was shown that it is always possible to compromise a database by using a combination of queries. In fact, the authors have developed a procedure (called a tracker) for finding the collection of queries to infer a desired fact. <p> It is interesting to note that although privacy needs to be supported in many OLAP applications, they are currently ignored in OLAP systems and literature. The interest in privacy continues in the SDB community, such as the Conference on Data Protection <ref> [DS80] </ref>. 8. Conclusions We have presented the properties that characterize Statistical Objects. We have examined examples form the Statistical Data Base (SDB) area and the OLAP areas, and pointed out that they are very similar in concepts, but differ somewhat in the emphasis of the problems they address.

Reference-contexts: In reality very few counties, if any, produce all the products monitored by economists. In such situations it is useful to consider some compression method. One such method was explored in <ref> [EOA81] </ref> . This method is based on the observation that nulls (or zeros) tend to cluster in the sequence of values of the summary attribute column. Thus, run length encoding was used. This is illustrated in Figure 21.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, summarization and query processing is slowed down accordingly. In section 6 we discuss other alternatives to the physical representation of the cross product space. Another issue for using this model is how to represent marginals. In a recent paper <ref> [GB+96] </ref> the authors suggest to use the reserved keyword value ALL to achieve this purpose. This is illustrated in Figure 10 in the column age-group. Thus, the row that contains ALL has a summary value over all age-groups in the columns population and avg. income. <p> This graphical representation is used in OLAP papers (e.g. <ref> [GB+96] </ref>) and multidimensional OLAP products (e.g. [ArborSoft]) since it is very useful in presenting the concept of the multidimensional space. Obviously, this representation is intended to be used only to convey concepts. It cannot be used for real databases for display of the schema or for display of the data. <p> Our purpose is only to demonstrate that the SDB and OLAP areas are concerned with similar operators. Statistical DB OLAP S-projection Slice S-selection Dice Sunion - - - Saggregation Roll up (consolidation) S-disaggregation Drill down 5.4 SQL extensions for OLAP In a recent paper <ref> [GB+96] </ref>, the authors have demonstrated how awkward and verbose are SQL statements for expressing summarization over the multidimensional space. In some cases, one needs to express a group by statement for each category value of a dimension, and then perform a union over them.

Reference-contexts: This is a problem of space-time tradeoff. Given a limited extra space, which summarizations should be pre 15 calculated for the maximum access benefit. A recent paper <ref> [HUR96] </ref> considered this question given that no information is known about access patterns. It was assumed that all summarization queries are equally likely. The paper considered which of the 2 n -1 summarizations should be materialized. <p> It was assumed that all summarization queries are equally likely. The paper considered which of the 2 n -1 summarizations should be materialized. This problem is shown in Figure 22 for a dataset with 3 dimensions (taken from <ref> [HUR96] </ref> ). The lines between the items show derivation possibilities.

Reference-contexts: Flower St. State City City Video Home VCR Camcorders City Street Street The middle example in Figure 8 illustrates the conceptual relationship of classification structures to ISA structures. In this example taken from <ref> [LRT96] </ref>, the instances of the classification of the bottom category attribute (home VCR, Camcorders, etc.) inherit properties of the top category attribute (video). Associating properties with instances of the classification structure adds richness and complexity to the modeling of classification structures.

Reference-contexts: Another example is that is meaningless to add populations over time (say, over months), while it makes sense to add accident counts over time. This has to do with the type of summary measure used. A recent paper <ref> [LS97] </ref> contains a detailed exploration of the summarizability conditions. This is an extremely important issue that is largely ignored in the OLAP literature, while in the SDB literature it is a major issue. 3.3.3 Micro-data, macro-data, and metadata There is another distinction between OLAP and SDBs that can be made. <p> As mentioned above, it is important for the purpose of summarizability to know whether this hierarchy is complete relative to the summary attribute <ref> [LS97] </ref>. If for example, we want to summarize average income for the state, it is incorrect to leave out the parts of the state that are not considered cities. <p> The second condition is whether the hierarchy is a true hierarchy. If for example, a city sprawls over the boundary of 2 states (such as Minneapolis-St. Paul), summarizability will not hold if the city appears as contained in these two states.

Reference-contexts: We describe a couple of examples below. One approach was to use the relational framework, but to enrich the structural model with semantics relating to the statistical object properties, specifically: multidimensionality, and the classification hierarchy. In <ref> [MRS92] </ref> operators that correspond to the relational algebra operators select, project, and union, as well as aggregate were defined. They have been labeled S-select, S-project etc. (S stands for statistical operator). <p> This issue is largely ignored in both the SDB and OLAP areas. One approach explored in the SDB area <ref> [MRS92] </ref> was to find an analogy to relational completeness. The technique used is a proof by homomorphism shown schematically in Figure 16. The main idea is as follows.

Reference-contexts: With this construct, the authors have defined a data cube operator, which we will discuss in the next section. A relational representation that partially overcomes the above problems is used by an OLAP company <ref> [MicroStrategy] </ref>. An example of this representation is shown in Figure 11 for a hospital and patient procedures database. <p> MOLAP ROLAP stands for Relational OLAP and MOLAP for Multidimensional OLAP. There are several vendors on the market that advocate one approach or the other. Two such examples can be found in Web pages. See <ref> [MicroStrategy] </ref> for ROLAP, and [ArborSoft] for MOLAP. We discuss this issue in this section because much of the debate is based on physical organization of the data cube, and the efficiency of access. Below are the main arguments made by each.

Reference-contexts: There was quite a bit of work in this area, that include random sampling from relational databases, from hash files, from B+trees, from spatial databases etc. The authors of many of these papers provided a good summary of this work in <ref> [OR95] </ref> . It seems that except for special operations where efficiency can improve greatly, data management systems and statistical packages will continue their independent existence.

Reference-contexts: Sunion: is used to combine multiple statistical objects which have overlapping (or partially overlapping) category values. We will show that similar operators have been identified in the OLAP area. Another example which illustrates the dependency of the operators suggested on the conceptual structure is the operators developed in <ref> [OOM85] </ref> . In this case, the model used was the 2-D representation of statistical objects, being the most commonly used by statisticians.

Reference-contexts: We describe in this section an example of the traditional 2-dimensional (2-D) representation of SDBs, followed by a data cube representation of OLAP databases, and show the correspondence in concepts. 2.1 The traditional representation of Statistical Databases Consider the dataset represented in Figure 1 as a 2-D table, taken from <ref> [RS90] </ref>. It shows Employment in California by sex by year by profession (the numbers are fictitious). This form of representing multidimensional tables is very popular in the Statistics area, perhaps because in the early days it was only possible to represent information on paper and thus the 2-D restriction. <p> For example, if one adds physicians by specialty to produce a summary dataset, then summarization over multiple (or all) specialties of the number of physicians will produce erroneous results, since the physicians with multiple specialties will be counted multiple times. This problem is referred to as the summarizability property <ref> [RS90] </ref>, and the conditions under which this property hold were investigated. Other reasons for non-summarizability also exist. For example, suppose that we have a states--&gt; cities classification structure. <p> The reason for this is that a classification structure has a schema component and an instances (values) component. That is, the category attributes and their structure constitute the schema, and the category values constitute the instances (data) for this schema. In a later paper <ref> [RS90] </ref> this approach was taken. The definition of a Statistical Object was introduced, and the model was labeled STORM (Statistical Object Representation Model) to emphasize the independence of the model from 2-D layout semantics.

Reference-contexts: In reality, it is very common to append to the data cube over time. The frequency of appends depends on the application, but it is not uncommon to have daily appends. This problem was addressed in a recent paper <ref> [RZ86] </ref>. Rather than restructuring the data cube for each append, the approach taken is to perform incremental appends. The proposed structure is called an extendible array as shown in Figure 24. A tree-based index structure is used to keep track of the multidimensional increments.

Reference-contexts: Of course, this assumes that the process of determining which 16 subcubes to generate is known. This is an active area of current research. Another example of dealing with the updates to a data cube is a recent paper <ref> [RKR97] </ref> which uses a packed R-tree structure to support bulk updates. 6.6 The debate of ROLAP vs. MOLAP ROLAP stands for Relational OLAP and MOLAP for Multidimensional OLAP. There are several vendors on the market that advocate one approach or the other.

Reference-contexts: The only parameter to be determined is the size of a subcube. This can be determined by estimating the average size of a query. An example of taking this approach of symmetric partitioning was reported in <ref> [SS94] </ref> in the context of dealing with multidimensional earth science databases. When knowledge exists on the access patterns to the data cube (typical queries), a non-symmetric partitioning approach can further improve performance.

Reference-contexts: This permit the use of very concise query languages. We refer to the capability as automatic aggregation <ref> [S82] </ref>, because of the ability to automatically infer the conditions for applying the aggregation operation. We illustrate this with an example, shown in Figure 13. <p> For example, one may start with disease types, then see an interesting phenomenon in the disease type cancer, and drill down to the breakdown of the various cancer diseases. This was also recognized as a useful operation in the SDB area and is referred to as disaggregation <ref> [S82] </ref>. Statisticians have also used the concept of disaggregation by proxy to estimate lower level breakdown of a classification. <p> The problem is whether privacy protection can be guaranteed. This problem is referred to as the statistical inference problem. There was a lot of work done in this area in the 1980; many references can be found in <ref> [S82] </ref>. However, it is worth mentioning here an important negative result described in [DS80]. In this paper it was shown that it is always possible to compromise a database by using a combination of queries.

Reference-contexts: This improved greatly the access efficiency of statistical queries. The above techniques did not reduce the size of storage for the cross product space. Another paper <ref> [WL+85] </ref> also used transposed tables, but also explored the benefit of encoding the category values in each column.

Reference-contexts: The claim that MOLAP performs better that ROLAP is intuitively believable. In a recent paper this was also substantiated by tests <ref> [ZDN97] </ref>. However, the debate will continue as new compression and encoding methods are applied to ROLAP databases. Both sides make good points, many of which were discussed in this paper.
