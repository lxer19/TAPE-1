Title: Input Synchronization in Low Power CMOS Arithmetic Circuit Design

Abstract: Power dissipation in static CMOS circuits can be directly related to the signal transition activity of the circuit. Spurious, unwanted, transition activity can account for a large percentage of the overall transition activity. One cause of spurious activity is relative skew in the arrival time of asynchronous input signals. We measure the effects of input signal arrival skew on a typical CMOS full adder cell, on an 8-bit ripple carry, and on small partial product reduction arrays. We use three-state buffers to synchronize the inputs to these circuits and examine the trade-off.

Reference-contexts: Spurious transitions, or glitch-ing, results from imbalances in signal propagation paths and may comprise a significant percentage of the total switching activity <ref> [1] </ref>. Synchronization and self-timing techniques may be used to reduce the amount of spurious transitions [4] [5]. For a particular transition, the total energy may be computed as E = P avg Dt = P inst dt Unlike P avg , E is independent of the cycle time.

Reference-contexts: This behavior is consistent with the timing of the cell, with the path through the circuit from C in to S being shorter than the path for A or B to S. 3. Synchronization for Ripple-Carry Adder We then measured, using TSIM <ref> [2] </ref> gate level simulation, the effects of input skew on an 8-bit ripple-carry adder. We used a simple delay model, with a unit delay for each full-adder and half-adder cell; however, we included the transitions on internal nodes of each adder cell in our transition counts.

Reference-contexts: 1. Overview Increasingly, power consumption is as an important parameter as speed and area in the design of digital integrated circuits. This trend is being driven by both the increase in portable applications as well as problems of heat dissipation associated with high integration circuits <ref> [3] </ref>. In static CMOS, signal transition activity, or switching activity, is directly related to the dynamic power dissipation [7], which is the most significant component of the circuit's total power dissipation.
