Reference-contexts: We call this system rama for Routine Activity Maintenance and Analysis. 2 Knowing What To Do and What To Expect Agre uses the term Dynamic to refer to regularities in the interactions between certain kinds of agents and certain kinds of worlds <ref> [ Agre, 1989, page 12 ] </ref> . For example the typical way that a 2 person and a washing machine interact as the wash is happening is a Dynamic. Autonomous agency presumes an agent capable of being both actor in and observer of the Dynamics in which it participates.

Reference-contexts: A set of interval queries, provides a useful shorthand for detning transition based expectations. There are tve such queries based on Borchardt's transition space <ref> [ Borchardt, 1992 ] </ref> notation: (CHANGE-TO property object value ?t1 ?t2) () (not (equal property object value ?t3)) ^ (equal property object value ?t4) ^ ?t1 ?t3 ?t4 ?t2. (CHANGE-FROM property object value ?t1 ?t2) () (equal property object value ?t3) ^ (not (equal property object value ?t4)) ^ ?t1 ?t3

Reference-contexts: Brian Drabble's excalibur <ref> [ Drabble, 1993 ] </ref> system is the only other plan execution system with which we are aware that attempts to combine planning and process reasoning. There are 16 a number of dierences between excalibur and rama.

Reference-contexts: In case 4, rama requests help, or suspends and retries the dynamic if help is unavailable. Finally, an inductive learning algorithm called marginal attribution <ref> [ Drescher, 1991 ] </ref> is used to verify the causal dependencies predicted by the causal patterns that may have been retrieved in handling unexpected events or in handling failed expectations.

Reference-contexts: of everyday activities such as cooking tasks to gain insight into demands that realistic environments place on autonomous agents in terms of the necessity to attend to and reason about exogenous processes. 7.2 Related Work Although process-based representations for action are used in a number of contemporary agent control architectures <ref> [ Pryor et al., 1995, Lyons, 1993, Firby, 1989 ] </ref> , none of these systems have a notion of external processes that can be initiated by an agent.

Reference-contexts: The behavior of their systems can be specited in terms of concurrent processes and discrete symbolic steps which control those processes <ref> [ Firby, 1992, Lyons, 1993, Pryor et al., 1995 ] </ref> . But as we have noted, in the real world , the agent is not the only source of continuous change.

Reference-contexts: The integration of qualitative envisionment and plan construction presents an interesting challenge <ref> [ Forbus, 1989 ] </ref> , and we will defer this issue. We believe that the preliminary successes of rama in a domain quite similar to that used by excalibur shows the promise of our approach. 17
