Abstract: This paper presents the IPUS (Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals) architecture to address the traditional perceptual paradigm's shortcomings in complex environments. It has two premises: (1) the search for correct interpretations of signal processing algorithms' (SPAs) outputs requires concurrent search for SPAs and control parameters appropriate for the environment, and (2) interaction between these search processes must be structured by a formal theory of how inappropriate SPA usage can distort SPA output. We describe IPUS's key components (discrepancy detection, diagnosis, reprocessing, and differential diagnosis) and their instantiation in an acoustic interpretation system. This application, along with another in the radar domain, supports our claim that the IPUS paradigm is feasible and generic.

Reference-contexts: is that expectation hypotheses are sometimes only expressible qualitatively, as in the example, "During the next 400 to 800 msec, a sinusoidal component currently at 1200 Hz will shift to a frequency between 1700 and 2000 Hz." Thus, our testbed discrepancy detection components use a range calculus similar to Allen's <ref> [1] </ref> to specify discrepancies. Discrepancy Diagnosis The discrepancy diagnosis KS is included to take advantage of the fact that a signal domain's SPA processing models can predict the form of an SPA's correlates when the SPA's parameter values are appropriate or inappropriate to the current scenario.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the energy algorithm can serve as a standard against which STFT output can be compared. We categorize discrepancies in focusing heuristics for diagnostic consideration in the following order: faults A discrepancy detected between an SPA's correlates and correlates from other SPAs applied to the same data. In <ref> [2] </ref> we discuss several fault discrepancy detection algorithms used in the sound understanding testbed.

Reference-contexts: The control framework also had to support context-sensitive focusing on particular uncertainties in order to control engagement and interruption of the architecture's reprocessing loop. For these reasons, IPUS uses the RESUN <ref> [3] </ref> framework to control knowledge source (KS) execution. This framework supports the view of interpretation as a process of gathering evidence to resolve hypotheses' sources of uncertainty (SOUs). It incorporates a language for representing SOUs as structures which trigger the selection of appropriate interpretation strategies.

Reference-contexts: In general, however, the problem of deciding when an SPA (e.g. a shape-from-X algorithm or an acoustic filter) with particular parameter settings is appropriate to a given environment may involve nonlinear control or be unsolvable with current control theory techniques. Recent systems in other fields <ref> [4, 5, 6, 9, 11] </ref> have used symbolically-oriented architectures that permit interpretation processes to reconfigure front-end signal processing. However, as the Related Work section will show, their architectures have not been general enough. <p> The framework is typical of systems whose input data points already represent useful information and require no formal front-end processing. Many perceptual frameworks <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref> implement the reprocessing concept only as reconfiguration guided by differential diagnosis. Often, they continuously gather data from every available SPA whether required for interpretation improvement or not. Only when ambiguous data is observed are certain SPAs' outputs actually examined to distinguish between competing interpretations.

Reference-contexts: The design of IPUS assumes that signal data is analyzed in blocks. IPUS uses an iterative process to converge to appropriate SPAs and interpretations. The following is a summary (see Architecture Components and <ref> [12, 14] </ref> for more detail). For each data block, the loop starts by processing the signal with an initial SPA configuration.

Reference-contexts: This view ignores IPUS's advantage over other paradigms in that it selectively samples several front-end processings' outputs, avoiding the traditional approach of continuously sampling several front-end pro-cessings' results. IPUS also encourages the development of fast, highly specialized, theoretically sound SPAs for reprocessing in appropriate contexts <ref> [13] </ref>. In this respect the IPUS paradigm decreases the expected processing time for scenarios requiring several processing views for plausible interpretations. Our acoustic testbed experiments indicate that the basic functionality and interrelationships of the architecture's components are realizable.

Reference-contexts: An SPA instance is specified by values for a generic SPA's parameters, and these values induce capabilities or limitations with respect to the scenario being monitored. We use "SPA" to refer to SPA instances. Consider the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) <ref> [15] </ref> in the acoustic domain. An STFT instance has particular values for its parameters, such as analysis window length, frequency-sampling rate, and decimation factor (consecutive analysis windows' separation).

Reference-contexts: The KS models this knowledge in a database of distortion operators. When an operator is applied to a description of undistorted SPA output, it returns the output with the operator's distortion introduced. The KS uses these operators in a means-ends analysis framework <ref> [16] </ref> to "explain" discrepancies between the expected form of an SPA's correlates and the actual form of the SPA's computed correlates. There are two inputs for this KS: an initial state representing the expected correlates' form and a goal state representing the computed correlates' form. <p> If no patch is possible, and no alternative explanations can be generated, the hypotheses hypotheses in the initial state are annotated with an SOU with a very negative rating. An issue not addressed in earlier work <ref> [16] </ref> that arose in the development of IPUS is the problem of inapplicable explanations. Sometimes the first explanation offered by the KS will not enable the reprocessing mechanism to eliminate a discrepancy. <p> Related Work IPUS represents the formalization and extension of concepts explored in our work on a diagnosis system that used formal signal processing theory to debug signal processing systems <ref> [16] </ref> and in work on meta-level control [10] that used a process of fault-detection, diagnosis, and replanning to choose appropriate parameters for controlling a problem-solving system. Recent systems have begun to explore interaction between interpretation activity and signal processing.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the KS mimics expert diagnostic reasoning in that it offers simplest explanations first <ref> [18] </ref>. Once a sequence is found, the KS enters its verify phase, "drops" to the lowest abstraction level, and checks that each operator's pre- and post-conditions are met when all available state information is considered.

Reference-contexts: This term refers not only to reconfiguration for tracking changes in signal behavior, but also to (repeated) reconfiguration for analyzing cached data to reduce uncertainty in signal interpretations. Research in active vision and robotics has recognized the importance of tracking-oriented reconfiguration <ref> [19] </ref>, and tends to use a control-theoretic approach for making reconfiguration decisions. It is indeed sometimes possible to reduce the reconfiguration of small sets of front-end SPAs to problems in linear control theory.
