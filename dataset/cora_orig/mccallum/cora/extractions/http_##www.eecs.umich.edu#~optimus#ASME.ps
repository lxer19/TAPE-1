Abstract: In this paper, randomized algorithms are used to design an open loop control for a clutch-to-clutch shift automatic transmission and to study the robustness of that control. The open loop control design problem can be posed as an optimal control problem but because of the computational cost associated with each simulation and the complexity of the transmission model, classical results from optimal control theory are not a practically feasible approach for this problem. We apply randomized search algorithms for optimization to these problems and present some promising results.

Reference-contexts: Also, except in Rosen and Luus (1992), only local minimization is considered. Having said this, we propose a randomized algorithms approach to solve the nonlinear optimization problem. To our knowledge, such an approach has not been studied extensively for optimal control. Indeed, Aimo Torn, in <ref> (Ali, Storey, and Torn 1996) </ref> says: "Solving 2 nonlinear optimal control problems with multiple minima by global optimization in general has never been addressed either by control engineers or by the global optimization community." Our aim is to show that a randomized algorithms approach for this problem has potential due to

Reference-contexts: Three trials are performed for each algorithm and some results of the best shifts obtained from each are recorded in Table 2. The average number of function calls and times for each algorithm are also given. For further comparison, Rosenbrock's line search technique <ref> (Bazaraa, Sherali, and Shetty 1993) </ref> is used to try to find the solution. This technique is inherently a local optimization technique. It, too, is used three times with different initial starting points. The results of the best of the three trials is recorded in Table 2.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2, we present a dynamic model for a clutch-to-clutch shifting automatic transmission. The modeling process starts off by establishing the static and dynamic equations that describe the subsystems of the powertrain. Our models are obtained by combining results from the published literature <ref> (Cho 1987) </ref>, (Cho and Hedrick 1989), (Kim et al. 1994). For most of the components, the models are obtained through derivation from first principles while for some we use fairly well established empirical models. After this, the subsystems are all connected to form the complete powertrain model.

Reference-contexts: The first step is to generate randomly a group of points in the input space. In general, the strategy of CRS is to replace the worst points of the group with better points through a selected operation. The Nelder-Mead simplex method <ref> (Nelder and Mead 1965) </ref> is one form and uses one type of replacement scheme. In Ali et al. (1997), a different replacement scheme is proposed.

Reference-contexts: The next step is to choose cost functions that can characterize shift quality. These cost functions have the parameterization of the clutch controls as their inputs. 3.1 Formulation of Cost Function Shift quality is not easy to define or measure as it has a highly subjective component. One paper <ref> (Schwab 1994) </ref> that deals with a metric for shift quality bases its metric on the subjective evaluation of a shift given by a number of passengers when several conditions are varied.
