Abstract: In the past few decades a science of computing has begun to emerge from the conglomeration of ad hoc techniques, and partially understood principles that governed the production of software once it became a widespread activity. Great strides forward in hardware technology have outstripped the relatively slow development of a necessary, complementary, software technology. However, early realization of this need for a science to underpin software development has led to much effort towards producing it. A central plank of the resultant formal infrastructure is logical deduction. It is almost axiomatic within computing science proper that the basis for software science should be logic, and, moreover, it should be deductive logic. This article first justifies the claim that a deductive use of logic is seen as having an exclusive claim to be the basis for computing science. And that, even where the formal requirements are more relaxed, programming is invariably viewed as a deductive type of process - i.e. reasoning from the general to the particular. Second, it presents a number of computing activities, peripheral to the mainstream effort, that use a process of induction rather than deduction. Thirdly, it argues that there is now an undeniable claim for the developing science of computing to admit an inductive paradigm into the fold and to give it a place alongside the deduction-based one. And lastly, admission of this radical alternative is expected to have a profound effect on the future development of both computing science theory and practice. Some of these expected repercussions are outlined.
