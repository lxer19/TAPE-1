Reference-contexts: Step 5. Return to Step 2. Step 6. Stop. We have solved the linear programming relaxation to optimality. 4.3 Performance of the column generation algorithm We tested our algorithm on two classes of randomly generated instances: 9 (i) instances with processing times and weights drawn from the uniform distribution <ref> [1; 100] </ref>. This concurs with the procedure used by De et al. (1994) to generate in stances. (ii) instances with processing times and weights drawn from the uniform distribution [1; 10]. <p> This concurs with the procedure used by De et al. (1994) to generate in stances. (ii) instances with processing times and weights drawn from the uniform distribution <ref> [1; 10] </ref>. We tested our algorithm on instances with n = 10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 60 jobs, and for each combination of n and instance class we generated 100 instances.
