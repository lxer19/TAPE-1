Abstract: A system to retrieve images using a description of visual appearance is presented. A multi-scale invariant vector representation is obtained by first filtering images in the database with Gaussian derivative filters at several scales and then computing low order differential invariants. The multi-scale representation is indexed for rapid retrieval. Queries are designed by the users from an example image by selecting appropriate regions. The invariant vectors corresponding to these regions are matched with those in the database both in feature space as well as in coordinate space and a match score is obtained for each image. The results are then displayed to the user sorted by the match score. From experiments conducted with over 1500 images it is shown that images similar in appearance and whose viewpoint is within 25 degrees of the query image can be retrieved with a very satisfactory average precision 1 of 57.4%

These combinations yield a set of differential invariants <ref> [2] </ref> that are invariant to two-dimensional rigid transformations. Retrieval is achieved in two computational steps. During the off-line computation phase each image in the database is first filtered at sampled locations and then filter responses across the entire database are indexed (see Section 3). <p> A full review of scale-space is beyond the scope of this paper and the reader is referred to <ref> [26, 7, 2, 9, 22] </ref>. Here some of the important consequences of incorporating scale space are considered. For increasing values of the Gaussian filter admits a narrowing band of frequencies and I will appear smoother. The scale-space of I is simply I , where is the free variable. <p> This issue is partially addressed by transforming the multi-scale feature vector so that it is invariant to 2D rigid transformations. Given the derivatives of an image I, irreducible differential invariants (invariant under the group of displacements) can be computed in a systematic manner <ref> [2] </ref>. The term irreducible is used because other invariants can be reduced to a combination of the irreducible set. The value of these entities is independent of the choice of coordinate frame (up to rotations) and the terms for the low orders (two here) are enumerated below.

Reference-contexts: From a practical standpoint this means that mis-matches due to an accidental similarity at a single scale can be reduced. A measure of similarity between two multi-scale vectors can be obtained by correlating them or computing the distance between the vectors. In earlier work <ref> [17] </ref> it was shown that multi-scale vectors can be used to retrieve images visually similar and within a small view and finite scale variation of the query. <p> These images are also observed to be visually similar and we posit that this method has good potential for image retrieval. While a discussion of matching objects across different sizes was presented and has been implemented elsewhere <ref> [17] </ref>, in this paper, the multi-scale invariant vector was used only to robustly characterize appearance. The next immediate step is to explic itly incorporate matching across size variations. A second important question is, what types of invariants should constitute a feature vector ? This is an open research issue.
