Abstract: This paper studies the usefulness of the projective approach to structure from motion (SFM). We conduct an essentially algorithm-independent experimental comparison of projective versus Euclidean reconstruction. Our results show that Euclidean reconstruction is essentially as accurate as projective reconstruction, even with significant calibration error and for the pure projective structure. Thus calibration error is not a compelling motivation for the projective framework. But projective optimization is more reliable than its Euclidean equivalent: we find that it has fewer problems with local minima. We describe several techniques that enhance the convergence of our Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. Most importantly, we find that it is crucial to exploit the compactness of projective space|even in the pure Euclidean framework. We also analyze the problem of determining a stable basis set of 5 points for projective reconstruction. Keywords Structure from motion, projective geometry, multi-frame structure from motion, optimization, Levenberg-Marquardt, calibration.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The projective approach to structure from motion (SFM) was introduced originally to avoid the difficulty of calibrating cameras precisely <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Whereas standard Euclidean SFM reconstructs a Euclidean 3D model of the scene assuming a known camera calibration, projective SFM reconstructs the projective structure without prior (linear) calibration.

Reference-contexts: This sets all 4 homogeneous coordinates of a point to roughly the same scale. For projective SFM, it also ensures that all components of the camera matrices M are about the same scale. This is essentially a standard technique for improving numerical conditioning <ref> [3, 12] </ref>. A second important technique exploits the compactness of projective space by changing the coordinates during minimization. It is impossible to parameterize projective space by one nonsingular set of coordinates.

Reference-contexts: For each sequence, we wish to determine the true MLEs for the projective and Euclidean structures. The only known way to accomplish this is via brute-force minimization using a form of steepest descent. We used the well known Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. We use LM partly because it is available as a MATLAB routine and partly because it is a conservative 11 algorithm, likely to converge to a local minimum near the starting estimate| the ground truth, in most of our experiments. <p> We conducted several tests to confirm the correctness of our LM algorithms. Our algorithms were based on the LM implementation in MATLAB, modified in some versions following Hartley <ref> [4] </ref>. We checked that algorithms written separately by the two authors gave the same reconstructions. We also checked that the reconstructions generated by the algorithms had 12 the correct invariances. The Euclidean algorithm computes the structure in the reference frame of the initial image. <p> The improvement in reliability was particularly important for poor starting guesses. Some plausibly useful techniques did not improve our results. Hartley has described a method for improving the speed and numerical stability of the LM algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. We implemented this technique, but for our experiments it did not offer significant speed advantages. Though it is crucial for minimizing over large numbers of unknowns, for the relatively few (20-30) feature points used in our experiments its significant overhead prevented any substantial speedup.

Reference-contexts: We have not fully checked the fixed-camera reconstruction, but the residual errors indicate that it too fails to converge in a number of cases. Finally, we ran the algorithms on a real-image sequence using tracked feature points and ground truth provided to us by J. Thomas <ref> [10, 5] </ref>. One image from this sequence is shown in figure 6. There were 32 automatically tracked feature points over 16 image frames. The sequence was generated by rotating a camera attached to the end ("hand") of a PUMA arm with length approximately 1.8 feet.

Reference-contexts: Thus the two approaches are equivalent if the Eu-clidean rotation matrix is allowed to be arbitrary rather than restricted to being orthogonal. Neglecting the rotation matrix constraints was already a standard technique for Euclidean algorithms, for instance, in the "8-point" computation of the essential matrix <ref> [6] </ref> or Tomasi and Kanade's approach to orthographic SFM [14]. Though the rotation constraints must be restored eventually in the Euclidean approach, there are standard techniques for doing this, e.g., [2] or [14]. <p> The result also may also be due to the fact that the Euclidean approach involves nonlinear constraints on the rotation matrices. These complicate the error function and can create additional local minima. The "8-point" algorithm <ref> [6] </ref> is a good analogy.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon has also been observed in other contexts. For instance, it is known that introducing more hidden 6 variables in neural nets improves generalization <ref> [7] </ref>, i.e., it eliminates false local minima. The result also may also be due to the fact that the Euclidean approach involves nonlinear constraints on the rotation matrices. These complicate the error function and can create additional local minima. The "8-point" algorithm [6] is a good analogy.

Reference-contexts: The camera rotations were also random 9 . For each motion, we chose a vector w = (w 1 ; w 2 ; w 3 ) 9 The rotations should have a small effect on the MLE <ref> [8] </ref>.

In standard Euclidean SFM, image formation can be modeled in exactly the same way; only the interpretation of the camera matrix M differs.

Reference-contexts: Thus, though the experiments reveal that the MLE differs relatively little when computed in the projective or Euclidean frameworks, non-optimal projective algorithms are likely to be signficantly less accurate and less robust than Euclidean ones, since non-optimal algorithms use just part of the available information or else weight it incorrectly <ref> [11] </ref>. On the other hand, pure optimization appears more reliable in the projective framework, or with rotation constraints relaxed in the Euclidean framework, than in the Euclidean framework enforcing the rotation constraints. The improvement is due to the reduced severity of the local-minimum problem and holds just for optimization.
