Abstract: This work is motivated by the existence of two useful but quite different knowledge representation formalisms, the situation calculus due to McCarthy, and the logic OL of only knowing due to Levesque. In this paper, we propose the logic AOL, which combines both approaches in a clean and natural way. We present a semantics for AOL which generalizes the semantics of OL to account for actions, and a sound and complete set of axioms for AOL which generalizes the Lin and Reiter foundational axioms of the situation calculus to account for only knowing. The logic is compatible with earlier work on knowledge and action in that the solution to the frame problem for knowledge proposed by Scherl and Levesque becomes now a theorem of AOL. We also demonstrate that the logic avoids certain anomalies present in related work by Lakemeyer. Finally we provide a mapping from OL into AOL such that a sentence of OL is valid iff its mapping is a theorem of AOL, thus providing, for the first time, a complete ax iomatic characterization of OL.

Reference-contexts: We do not expect AOL to be implemented in its full generality.

We believe that AOL has a role to play in future extensions of GOLOG. Other future work includes extensions of AOL itself such as a generalization to the multi-agent case.

Reference-contexts: However, in this paper we will not be concerned with such issues, and all the examples used here consider only knowing applied to objective sentences. [Lev90] presents an axiomatization of OL, which is complete for the propositional case, but was recently shown to be incomplete for the full first-order language <ref> [HL95] </ref>. An interesting by-product of our work is that, by appealing to second-order logic, a complete axiom system for OL obtains. To see the utility of O, consider an agent who knows the standard name for the current temperature, which could be a particular value on some temperature scale. <p> Apart from this technical issue, it should be noted that the price of the axiomatization of OL is high in that we need to appeal to second-order logic. Whether there is a first-order axiom system for OL remains an open question. Note, however, that Halpern and Lakemeyer <ref> [HL95] </ref> have recently shown that, even if one exists, it cannot be recursive. 15 So chances are that we may have to settle for second-order. 8 Comparison with Lakemeyer's OLS: As already mentioned, Lakemeyer [Lak96] has also proposed an amalgamation of only knowing and the situation calculus.

There are obvious differences between his logic OLS and AOL. For one, OLS considers real knowledge rather than belief, that is, whatever is believed in OLS is also true in S 0 .
