Reference-contexts: The mixed integer formulation creates additional difficulties. Direct approaches to this Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem using branch and bound algorithms <ref> [4] </ref> do not complete in a reasonable time when used with circuit simulation. The branch and bound algorithm formulates a Non-Linear Programming (NLP) problem as a sub-problem, and solves many of these sub-problems in the course of solving the MINLP problem.

Reference-contexts: The best test of these analog circuit synthesis methodologies is to follow designs through the complete cycle, including design specific inputs and results from fabricated devices. Generation of mixed-signal analog blocks can be approached in several ways. In the top-down, hierarchical approach, proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>, constraint values are passed down through layers of the design, with the bottom layer corresponding to the transistors. This approach was initially applied to a current-switched DAC example, and has also been used to build an oversampled ADC [10].

Reference-contexts: In the top-down, hierarchical approach, proposed in [9], constraint values are passed down through layers of the design, with the bottom layer corresponding to the transistors. This approach was initially applied to a current-switched DAC example, and has also been used to build an oversampled ADC <ref> [10] </ref>. The main goal of the hierarchical approach is to obtain reliably and quickly a design that satisfies all constraints. When in addition to satisfying constraints, a highly optimized circuit with respect to area and speed is required, then a at methodology may prove more effective.

Reference-contexts: A faster algorithm was required. A promising technique separates the problem into a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) sub-problem, and a separate non-linear programming (NLP) problem. The NLP solution creates linear constraints to form a linear outer approximation to the feasible region <ref> [12] </ref>, and this outer approximation is used by the MILP sub-problem. MILP solutions are tested for feasibility, where infeasible solutions spawn NLP sub-problems to improve the outer approximation. When the MILP solution is found to be feasible the problem is solved.

Reference-contexts: The architecture uses a two dimensional array of segment current sources, with a local row / column digital decode, which allows individual selection of each cell [15]. The cell schematic is shown in Fig. 2, and further details may be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. The DAC optimization problem, including constraints to ensure both analog circuit performance, and digital signal integrity, comprises 19 design variables and 44 constraints.

Reference-contexts: A Vds margin constraint was included in optimizations to insure operation far enough into saturation that this would bound modelling errors. Worst case design was used to bracket performance predictions. Statistical device mismatch due to random and gradient effects used the model in <ref> [16] </ref>, and mismatch parameters were extrapolated from that source. Static linearity was predicted for 3-s yield. INL due to I-R drops in supplies was modeled. Lead inductance effects on the output signal were included, but chip level a. Dimensions in microns, on a 0.6 micron pitch. b. Minimum size used. <p> When the data was further analyzed, two underestimated effects were seen. First, the process gradients were twice the magnitude predicted by extrapolation from <ref> [16] </ref>, and second, edge effects on the array were significant, causing mismatch between edge columns and the center, and between LSB currents and segment currents.
