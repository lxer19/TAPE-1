Abstract: We consider the problem of analyzing market-basket data and present several important contributions. First, we present a new algorithm for finding large itemsets which uses fewer passes over the data than classic algorithms, and yet uses fewer candidate itemsets than methods based on sampling. We investigate the idea of item reordering, which can improve the low-level efficiency of the algorithm. Second, we present a new way of generating "implication rules," which are normalized based on both the antecedent and the consequent and are truly implications (not simply a measure of co-occurrence), and we show how they produce more intuitive results than other methods. Finally, we show how different characteristics of real data, as opposed to synthetic data, can dramatically affect the performance of the system and the form of the results.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Within the area of data mining, the problem of deriving associations from data has recently received a great deal of attention. The problem was first formulated by Agrawal et al, <ref> [AIS93a, AIS93b, AS94, AS95, ALSS95, SA95, MAR96, Toi96] </ref> and is often referred to as the "market-basket" problem. In this problem, we are given a set of items and a large collection of transactions which are subsets (baskets) of these items.

We used 100,000 transactions, with an average size of 20 items chosen from 1000 items, and average large itemsets were of size 4. The census data was a bit more challenging.

In this problem, we are given a set of items and a large collection of transactions which are subsets (baskets) of these items. <p> To address both of those issues we introduce Dynamic Itemset Counting (DIC), an algorithm which reduces the number of passes made over the data while keeping the number of itemsets which are counted in any pass relatively low as compared to methods based on sampling <ref> [Toi96] </ref>. <p> If the data is not fairly homogeneous, we can run through it in a random order (section 2.3). Some important relevant work was done by Toivonen using sampling <ref> [Toi96] </ref>. His technique was to sample the data using a reduced threshold for safety, and then count the necessary itemsets over the whole data in just one pass. However, this pays the added penalty of having to count more itemsets due to the reduced threshold.
