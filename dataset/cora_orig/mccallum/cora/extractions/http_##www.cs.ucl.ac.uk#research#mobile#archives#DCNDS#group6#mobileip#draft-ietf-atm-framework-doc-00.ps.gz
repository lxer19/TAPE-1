Abstract: This memo is an internet draft. Internet Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its Areas, and its Working Groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet Drafts. Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as a "working draft" or "work in progress". Please check the lid-abstracts.txt listing contained in the internet-drafts shadow directories on nic.ddn.mil, nnsc.nsf.net, nic.nordu.net, ftp.nisc.src.com, or munnari.oz.au to learn the current status of any Internet Draft. 1.

Reference-contexts: Support switched virtual connections (SVCs) as well as permanent virtual connections (PVCs), o Maybe directly connected, due to the existence of SVCs, o Do not share a common IP-level (or L3) network prefix, o Support for multiple subnetwork point of attachment (SNPA) address formats (four possible formats are allowed in <ref> [ATM 1993] </ref>), o Support negotiations for, e.g., MTU size, methods of encapsulation, o Do not have to support an efficient broadcast/multicast mechanism for address resolution, o Are not part of a single working group and hence security is an issue, and o Are potentially billed for holding circuit holding time. <p> The LATMs are simplified in that they: o support a single subnetwork point of attachment (SNPA) address format (four allowed address formats are specified in <ref> [ATM 1993] </ref>, o support a single default MTU size, and o support a default LLC/SNAP encapsulation as specified in [HEI 93a]. For more information see [LAU 93]. 5.1.2 The SVC-based WATM subnet The SVC-based WATM subnet was discussed in Section 5.3.

Reference: [HEI 1992] <author> J. Heinanen, </author> <title> `Routing and Addressing in ATM Networks', private memorandum posted to the P over ATM Working Group, </title> <month> 27 November, </month> <year> 1992. </year> <title> [ISO 8473] `Information technology - Telecommunications and Information exchange between systems - In termediate system to Intermediate system Intra-Domain routing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the Protocol for providing the Connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473),' Inter national Organization for Standardization, </title> <year> 1992. </year>
Reference-contexts: That is, the ATM network and the attached ESs or ISs exchange routing information on a peer ba sis, network level addressing is used across the ES or IS and ATM interface. Discussions on peer models can be found in [LYO 92], <ref> [HEI 1992] </ref> and [LIA 93]. A rationale for this model is that due to the envisioned complexity of future ATM networks, the routing com plexities will be similar to routing over complex internets. <p> The routing function of the IS is only required during the connection set-up phase and is not in the path of the data flow following the connection establishment. There are issues to be worked for this Peer Model (see, e.g., <ref> [HEI 1992] </ref> and [LIA 93]), including: o Defining a routing architecture which - scales to the large size expected of the eventual ATM network, and - supports TOS routing, and o Defining a functional architecture which - scales to the large size expected of the eventual ATM network, Cole [Page 11]
