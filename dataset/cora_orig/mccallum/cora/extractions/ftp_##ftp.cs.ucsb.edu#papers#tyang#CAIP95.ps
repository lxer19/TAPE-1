Abstract: In this paper, we develop a static global scheduling scheme for mapping computer vision and image processing (CVIP) operations on distributed-memory multiprocessors. The scheduler operates on task graphs containing linear chains of tasks, loops, and possibly data-dependent operations. The scheduler employs a shortest path algorithm to optimize the global parallel time, taking into consideration possible variation in the task and resource parameters (such as the image size and number of processors used), and both the intra- and the inter-operation computa tion and communication costs.

The input image was assumed to be corrupted by a multiplicative noise process and an additive noise process.

Reference-contexts: We denote the processor speed as !, which is the time for a floating point operation. A task may employ one of the following six data partitioning schemes, which are also provided by the High-Performance Fortran <ref> [5] </ref>: row, column, row-cyclic, column-cyclic, block, and block-cyclic partitions. In this research, we propose a static scheduling scheme for optimizing the parallel time of CVIP operations involving multiple stages, loops, and data dependent operations.
