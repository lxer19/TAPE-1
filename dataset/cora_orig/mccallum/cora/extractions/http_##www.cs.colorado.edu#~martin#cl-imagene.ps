Title: Expressing Rhetorical Relations in Instructional Text: A Case Study of the Purpose Relation  
Author: Keith Vander Linden James H. Martin 
Affiliation: ITRI, University of Brighton University of Colorado  
Abstract: Natural language provides an extensive set of lexical and grammatical forms for expressing concepts, a set from which writers choose the particular form which they feel will produce the most effective expression given the communicative context. An important task of the text generation researcher is to specify both the range of these forms and the contexts in which they are used. This paper addresses this issue in the context of the expression of procedural relations between actions in instructional text. It employs the following four step approach to achieve this goal: (1) Collect a corpus of the relevant text type; (2) Perform a detailed linguistic study of a portion of this corpus, called the training set, and reserving the remainder as a testing set; (3) Implement the results of this study in a text generation system; (4) Compare the output of the system with the text found in the entire corpus. This has resulted in the construction of IMAGENE, an instructional text generation system which embodies a model of the forms of expression consistently used by instructional text writers over a broad range of instruction types. The details of IMAGENE's treatment of purpose expressions are given as representative of the coverage and form of the full system.

Reference-contexts: The one common feature is that they all involve the expression of actions and of the procedural relationships between them. 1 As an example of the nature of this text, consider the following excerpt from the instructions for the GTE Airfone <ref> (Airfone, 1991) </ref> which will be called the Remove-Phone text: (2) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out. Return to seat to place calls.

Return to seat to place calls. (Airfone, 1991) 2 This passage gives an example of the variation of expressional form that is common in instructional text. It contains, among other things, two expressions of purpose: remove phone and to place calls. <p> position is primarily used for charging the batteries. (Code-a-phone, 1989) (3d) For frequently busy numbers, you'll want to use REDIAL [7], and the pause will have to be in Redial memory. (Code-a-phone, 1989) (3e) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out. <ref> (Airfone, 1991) </ref> (3f) Return handset to wall unit from which it was taken. Insert heel first as shown, then push top in firmly. (Airfone, 1991) (3g) Tilt pan down slightly at the rear so that the fluid drains out. (Reader's Digest, 1981) All four of the issues of lexical and grammatical <p> pause will have to be in Redial memory.

(Code-a-phone, 1989) (5) To place call, dial AREA CODE and NUMBER. To end call, press red HANG UP button. <ref> (Airfone, 1991) </ref> In (4), the action of getting more information is optional, that is, the reader may 16 Keith Vander Linden and James H. <p> Consider the following examples of these situations: (6a) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out. <ref> (Airfone, 1991) </ref> (6b) ??

RST allows the representation of this situation because its relations are not defined in terms of lexical and grammatical forms (Mann and Thompson, 1987). When a purpose does not have conditions upon it and the scope is global, Purpose-TNF marks the purpose as a to infinitive (TNF).

IMAGENE's architecture implements a particular interpretation of Cum-ming's proposal (1991) that nominalizations be dealt with at two levels, one at which the actions are not specified for nominal or clausal expression, and another where they are.

Reference-contexts: In cases such as this one, the procedural distinction between child and sibling actions is a tricky one <ref> (cf. Di Eugenio, 1993) </ref>. We have routinely classified actions expressed with to infinitive constructions as parent nodes rather than as sibling nodes. We leave a more complete treatment of this distinction to future work. 20 Keith Vander Linden and James H.
