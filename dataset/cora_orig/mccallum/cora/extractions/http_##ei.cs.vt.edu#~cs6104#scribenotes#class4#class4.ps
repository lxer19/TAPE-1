Reference-contexts: Clearly multiplication is commutative mod p. Also, Z=(p) is closed under multiplication and 1 is the identity mod p, so all it needs to be an abelian group (and therefore a commutative ring) is an inverse for all elements. By Fermat's theorem (2.1.3) <ref> [1] </ref>, we know that any element a 2 Z=(p) will have inverse a p2 2 Z=(p), hence Z=(p) is a field. Some non-examples of fields are Z, R [X], and Z=(n) where n is not prime.
