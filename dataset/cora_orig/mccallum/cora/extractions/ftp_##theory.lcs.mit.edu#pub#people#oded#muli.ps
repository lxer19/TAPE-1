Abstract: The current proof of the PCP Theorem (i.e., N P = PCP(log; O(1))) is very complicated. One source of difficulty is the technically involved analysis of low-degree tests. Here, we refer to the difficulty of obtaining strong results regarding low-degree tests; namely, results of the type obtained and used by Arora and Safra and Arora et. al. In this paper, we eliminate the need to obtain such strong results on low-degree tests when proving the PCP Theorem. Although we do not get rid of low-degree tests altogether, using our results it is now possible to prove the PCP Theorem using a simpler analysis of low-degree tests (which yields weaker bounds). In other words, we replace the strong algebraic analysis of low-degree tests presented by Arora and Safra and Arora et. al. by a combinatorial lemma (which does not refer to low-degree tests or polynomials).

Such verifiers are constructed by "parallelization" of simpler verifiers, and thus the problem of "consistency" arises.

Reference-contexts: Hastad's recent work [H96] contains a combinatorial consistency lemma which is related to our Lemma 1.1 (i.e., the "simple case" lemma). However, Hastad's lemma refers to the case where the test accepts with very low probability and so its conclusion is weaker (though harder to establish). Raz and Safra <ref> [RaSa] </ref> claim to have been inspired by our Lemma 1.2 (i.e., the "sparse case" lemma). 1.4 Organization The (basic) "sparse case" consistency lemma is presented in Section 2. The application to the PCP Characterization Theorem is presented in Section 3.

[ALMSS] proved such a result. 1 The full proof is quite complex and is algebraic in nature. A weaker result due to Gemmel et. al. [GLRSW] (see <ref> [RS96] </ref>) asserts the existence of a d-degree test which, using d+2 queries, rejects such bad functions with probability at least (1=d 2 ).

Combining the result of Gemmel et. al. <ref> [GLRSW, RS96] </ref> with our combinatorial consistency lemma (i.e., Lemma 1.2), we obtain an alternative proof of the following result Lemma 1.3 (low-degree tester): For every ffi &gt; 0, there exists a constant c and a probabilistic oracle machine, T , which on input n; p; d runs for poly (n; d; <p> Our only reference to algebra is in relying on the result of Gemmel et. al. <ref> [GLRSW, RS96] </ref> (which is 1 An improved analysis was later obtained by Friedl and Sudan [FS]. 2 Actually, [ALMSS] only prove agreement on an (arbitrary large) constant fraction of the domain. 3 weaker and has a simpler proof than that of [ALMSS]). <p> The (i; j) th entry is a pair over S which represents a pairwise independent sequence (which equals an element in C = R). Clearly, Claim 3.4 Construction 3.3 satisfies Assuptions 1-5. Combining all the above with the low-degree test of <ref> [GLRSW, RS96] </ref> using the results claimed there 7 , we get a low-degree test which is sufficiently efficient to be used in the proof of the PCP-Characterization of NP. <p> On the other hand, by [GLRSW] (see also [S95, Thm 3.3] and <ref> [RS96, Thm 5] </ref>), either Prob x;y2F n d+2 X ff i t (x + iy) 6= 0 &gt; 2 (d + 2) 2 (13) or t is very close (specifically at distance at most 1=(d + 2) 2 ) to some degree-d polynomial.
