Abstract: The defining characteristic of ubiquitous computing is the attempt to break away from the traditional desktop computing paradigm and move computational power into the environment that surrounds the user. Applications of ubiquitous computing technology are the main drivers for research in this area. We describe the work over the past 18 months done by the Future Computing Environments Group at Georgia Tech. We have an applications perspective on ubiquitous computing and have prototyped many systems using a wide range of technology in several separate domains. This paper summarizes three emergent research themes that are the result of generalizing our prototyping and evaluation experience: automated capture, integration and access; context-awareness; and ubiquitous software services. We define each of these themes, demonstrate systems we have built which emphasize the theme, and present a number of open issues that will guide our future work and hopefully that of others. We conclude by sharing a number of general insights on our research method in ubiquitous computing.

Reference-contexts: This audio service worked very well, but it was not cross-platform and students without access to a UNIX workstation were unable to take advantage of it. We used this Classroom 2000 prototype during a 10-week graduate course and the results of our evaluation are reported elsewhere <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. This initial evaluation was much more of a feasibility experiment to see if we could get the technology to work for an entire course.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a number of prototype systems to suit varying teaching and learning styles <ref> [2] </ref>. The system we describe here suited a teaching style that is similar to a conference presentation. The teacher prepares slides and gives copies to the students before class. Students can take notes on top of the slides and the teacher displays the slides and annotates them during the lecture. <p> This audio service worked very well, but it was not cross-platform and students without access to a UNIX workstation were unable to take advantage of it.

The vision of ubiquitous computing |first expressed by Weiser [22] and grounded in experimental work done at Xerox PARC| holds the promise of yet another interaction paradigm shift.
