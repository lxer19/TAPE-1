Title: A POLYNOMIAL APPROACH TO ORTHOGONAL POLYNOMIAL TRANSFORMS  
Author: DAVID K. MASLEN 
Abstract: We present a new approach, based on polynomial arithmetic, to fast algorithms for the expansion of a function in orthogonal polynomial sequences. Such algorithms were recently constructed by Driscoll and Healy. Our treatment provides a clear formulation of the properties required by their algorithm, thus allowing variants of their algorithm to be developed in a more general context and under weakened conditions.

Thanks to Persi Diaconis for involving me with this problem and his encouragement and advice. Thanks to Dennis Healey and Dan Rockmore for many conversations and explanations. <p> This is only a useful technique when we do have algorithms for the fT n g transforms. Fortunately when the T n are Chebyshev polynomials we may use classical techniques to compute the transforms in O (N (log N ) 2 ).

Recently, Steidl and Tasche <ref> [13] </ref> gave an extremely efficient direct algorithm for this computation. <p> Examples and generalizations Assume the orthogonal polynomials, T n , are the Chebyshev polynomials and the corresponding moment functional has total mass 1. Then x N j = cos 2N j = 1 N . Steidl and Tasche <ref> [13] </ref> give an algorithm for the inverse orthogonal polynomial transform with respect to the Chebyshev polynomials in no more than c N = 3 2 N log 2 N N + 1 scalar operations when N is a power of two (we count one operations as a multiplication plus an addition
