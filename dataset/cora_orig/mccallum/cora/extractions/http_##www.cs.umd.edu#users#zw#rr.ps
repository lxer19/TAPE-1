Abstract: Guarantees of services in a networked environment are provided by the proper allocation and utilization of network and system resources. A lot of research work in packet scheduling, QoS routing, traffic multiplexing, etc. has been done aimed at providing deterministic or statistical service guarantees, while utilizing resources efficiently. In this paper, we propose a resource reservation scheme for a class of multimedia applications. We characterize this class of multimedia applications as synchronized distributed multimedia sessions, which we believe represent a large number of multimedia applications. In addition to this particular class of applications, the reservation scheme can also be applied to other applications with synchronized resource requirements. Mechanisms are devised so that the scheme can find a feasible reservation whenever one exists, in contrast to existing protocols where request can fail unpredictably even when there is available resource. The reservation protocol eliminates the need for application-level reservation failure-retry which may adversely affect the network utilization. Based upon a layer of resource abstraction, the scheme suits well with today's heterogeneous network environment.
