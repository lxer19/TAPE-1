Title: On Using an OODBMS in a CASE Environment  
Author: Walid Taha 
Date: April 14, 1995  
Affiliation: Oregon Graduate Institute  
Abstract: Three papers were studied in an attempt to explore the impact of OODBMS technology on CASE environments. In this report, first, an effort to unify the terminology of the papers is made. Then, one paper which reports a positive experience with using OODBMS technology in a CASE environment is discussed in more detail.

Reference-contexts: Database Management Systems (OODBMS) have a positive impact on the quality and ease of development of Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE 1 ) environments? The report is primarily based on three works: An account of experience with a software development environment (SAMS) built on top of a generalized OODBMS interface <ref> [1] </ref>, an examination of Integrated Project Support Environment (IPSE) technology [2], and an overview of Repository technology [3].

Bernstein's perspective has some points in common with both Ketabchi and Brown.

Although all three papers are concerned with aspects related to the automation of software development tasks, each has a different perspective. 1 Specifically, ones capable of capturing large existing systems, as opposed to ones only capable of automatic code generation. 1 SAMS is a comprehensive CASE environment.

Reference-contexts: This has a significant impact on simplifying the task of creating CASE tools. Ketabchi reports that "The most important impact of using an OODBMS as the central component of SAMS is its positive effect on the architectural simplicity of the system." According to <ref> [8] </ref>, the circumvention of the impedance-mismatch is a major advantage of OODBMS technology.
