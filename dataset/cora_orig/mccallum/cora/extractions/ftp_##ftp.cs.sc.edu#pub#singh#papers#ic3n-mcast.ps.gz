Abstract: We consider the problem of multicasting optimally to mobile users in a cellular mobile network. In the absence of mobility, a single channel can be used to multicast to all mobile users within a cell. However, mobility combined with the effects of fading necessitate a more complex channel allocation policy. We present an optimal channel allocation algorithm for multicas-ting within a cell and indicate how it can be extended to the multicell case.

Reference-contexts: In this case we have a choice of policies regarding the allocation of B 2 continue with the multicast in c 2 starting from byte T B 3 + 1 (as suggested in <ref> [1] </ref>) so that the new MH can `catch up' with the rest of the MHs in c 2 , or ignore the new MH and continue with the multicast (in this case the MH would treat bytes T B 3 to T B 2 as being lost), or split the multicast

Reference-contexts: As the user roams, the data is forwarded to the new base station and gets transmitted to the user in that new cell. Our implementation of the networking software responsible for forwarding data and handling QoS requirements is discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>.

It is likely that these MHs will be located in different cells.

Reference-contexts: policy used is deterministic (a policy such as TDMA 1 could be used, for example). 1 The reason for this choice is that most proposed standards for communication within a cell such as, the European standard (GSM), the North American standard (IS-54) and another Pan-European standard (DECT) use TDMA (see <ref> [3] </ref>). 2.2 Some Examples of the Effects of Mo- bility and c 4 contain mobiles that belong to M. Thus C = fc 1 ; c 2 ; c 3 ; c 4 g. Three types of moves are illustrated in the figure.
