Reference-contexts: The technique for both the UP 6= NP and the output-multiplicy hierarchy is derived from Bennett and Gill's proof that NP 6= coNP relative to a random oracle <ref> [BG81] </ref>. For a more detailed introduction to random oracle arguments and results, we refer the reader to Bennett and Gill's original paper [BG81] or either of Kurtz, Mahaney, and Royer's papers [KMR95, KMR92]. <p> The technique for both the UP 6= NP and the output-multiplicy hierarchy is derived from Bennett and Gill's proof that NP 6= coNP relative to a random oracle <ref> [BG81] </ref>. For a more detailed introduction to random oracle arguments and results, we refer the reader to Bennett and Gill's original paper [BG81] or either of Kurtz, Mahaney, and Royer's papers [KMR95, KMR92]. In particular, we will refer the reader to these papers on the ticklish matter of justifying the standard interpretation of random oracle separations. <p> Informally, this means that there is a well-defined "measure 1" theory. Our next goal is to state Lemma 7, a result by Stuart Kurtz [Kur83] that improves on a technical lemma of Bennett & Gill <ref> [BG81, Lemma 1] </ref>. Lemma 7 is a key tool in obtaining sufficient conditions for certain sets to be measure 1. Lemma 8 below gives a sample such application. We provide some preliminary definitions and conventions before stating this lemma. <p> Then, (f R : (8i)[ :A (i; R; B R ) ] g) = 1. The proof of this lemma is a simple density argument similar to Bennett and Gill's <ref> [BG81] </ref> proof of their Lemma 1. 4.2 UP 6= NP Relative to a Random Oracle We say that M , a polynomial time, nondeterministic Turing machine, UP-accepts a language A (written: L UP (M ) = A) if A = L (M ) and, for each a 2 A, there is <p> It is known [ESY84, GS88, Sel94] that this conjecture implies (i) NP 6= co-NP, (ii) NP 6= UP, and NPMV c NPSV. It has been known that NP 6= co-NP holds relative to random oracle <ref> [BG81] </ref> and 35 this paper demonstrates that the second and third consequences hold relative to a random oracle. Finally we raise the following technical question: Let k 1.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to find an oracle relative to which both hierarchies collapse. Because the proof of the previous section relativizes, any oracle making the polynomial hierarchy proper <ref> [Has86, Yao85] </ref> will also make the output-multiplicity hierarchy proper. Thus, oracles exist for all possible scenarios concerning the relationships between a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy and a collapse of the output-multiplicity hierarchy. 3.1 Generic oracles A condition is a partial function from fl to f 0; 1 g.

Reference-contexts: Thus, "NPMV c PF" means that every partial multivalued function in NPMV can be computed by some 3 deterministic polynomial-time transducer. Using this notation, the assertion we made above states that NPMV c PF if and only if P = NP. Hemaspaandra et al. <ref> [HNOS96] </ref> addressed the question (raised by Selman [Sel94]) of whether every function in NPMV has a refinement in NPSV, where NPSV is the set of all partial single-valued functions f 2 NPMV. They proved that this is so only if the polynomial hierarchy collapses to P 2 . <p> For each k 1, a partial multivalued function f 2 NPkV if and only if some refinement of f can be computed by a nondeterministic, polynomial time-bounded transducer that has at most k distinct values on any input. Thus, in particular, NP1V = NPSV. Once again, Hemaspaandra et al. <ref> [HNOS96] </ref> proved that if NP2V c NPSV, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level. In this paper we investigate the strictness of the output-multiplicity hierarchy and establish three main results pertaining to this: 1. <p> transducer and g that witness this, the number of queries made by the transducer on any input x is no more than b (jxj). 5 2 If the Output-Multiplicity Hierarchy Col lapses, So Does the Polynomial Hierarchy Once it was known that NP2V c NPSV implies PH = P 2 <ref> [HNOS96] </ref>, one natural question to raise was whether every partial multivalued function in NPMV has a refinement in some reduction class to NPSV. <p> if x 2 A or y 2 A, then ; 6= set-f (x; y) A: For those familiar with prior work on selectivity, we note that a set A is p-selective [Sel79] if and only if A has a 2-selector that belongs to PF t and that A is NPMV-selective <ref> [HNOS96] </ref> if and only if A has a 2-selector that belongs to NPMV. Claim: For each k &gt; 0, every A 2 NP has a k-selector that belongs to NPkV. Proof: Fix k. <p> This intuition is borne out by the result of Selman [Sel79] that SAT is p-selective if and only if SAT 2 P and by the result of Hemaspaandra et al. <ref> [HNOS96] </ref> that SAT is NPSV-selective only if NP (NP " coNP)=poly. Continuing with the proof, let L 2 P 2 . <p> We will not give the proof of Lemma 4. The argument is similar to proofs of Ko [Ko83] and of later researchers <ref> [LS93, HNOS96] </ref> that dealt essentially with the scenario of Example 3. The combinatorics of Ogihara's argument is necessarily more involved. <p> With regard to this question, let us note that Hemaspaandra et al. <ref> [HNOS96] </ref> showed that NPMV c NPSV implies the polynomial hierarchy collapses to ZPP NP , and our techniques do not seem to obtain even this. Another related open question is whether a conjecture raised by Even, Selman, and Yacobi [ESY84] holds relative to a random oracle.

Reference-contexts: Let C = H G. Recall that P 2 = P NP . Long and Selman <ref> [LS86] </ref> proved that P 2 = P 2 if and only if P;S P;S for all sparse sets S.

Reference-contexts: Would such an hypothesis still collapse the polynomial hierarchy? The only significant work on this question is due to Ogihara who proved the following result: Theorem 1 (Ogihara <ref> [Ogi96] </ref>) Let c &lt; 1 be a constant. If every multival-ued function in NPMV has a refinement in PF NPSV (c log n), then PH = P 2 . <p> Hence, the claim follows. Example 3, continued For z 2 SAT =n , a string x loses to z if g (x; z) = x. So, by definition of a selector, we must have x 2 SAT. The following lemma is due to Ogihara <ref> [Ogi96] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A fundamental question is whether for each f 2 NPMV, there is a g 2 PF, so that g (x) is always some value of f (x).

A key notion in this area is that of a refinement of a function. We introduce this idea through an important example. Let PF denote the set of all partial functions that are computed by deterministic polynomial time-bounded transducers.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to find an oracle relative to which both hierarchies collapse. Because the proof of the previous section relativizes, any oracle making the polynomial hierarchy proper <ref> [Has86, Yao85] </ref> will also make the output-multiplicity hierarchy proper. Thus, oracles exist for all possible scenarios concerning the relationships between a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy and a collapse of the output-multiplicity hierarchy. 3.1 Generic oracles A condition is a partial function from fl to f 0; 1 g.
