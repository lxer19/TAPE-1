Abstract: In this presentation an approach towards a description of spatial deixis based on the perceptual and cognitive abilities of humans is outlined. After a basic introduction into space perception and representation the findings of this part are taken to form the basis for a characterization of the phenomenon of deixis as well as the conceptual components of deictic expressions in a natural language. For the analysis of deictic expressions a cross-linguistic view is applied to find on the one hand universal components of those expressions but also a number of potentially influencing factors. The goal is to find features that may be components of deictic expressions and thus must be considered in a general model of spatial deixis which can serve to classify and describe the meaning of spatial deictic expressions in any natural language.
