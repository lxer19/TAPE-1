Reference-contexts: Lukasiewicz logic arrays (LLAs) were described in [Mills/Beavers/Daffinger 1990, Mills 1990]. LLAs were reduced to simple circuits, some consisting of trees of diodes in [Mills 1992]. LLAs are thus similar to the diode-resistor function generators of [Wilkinson 1963]. LLAs were used to implement a silicon retina and characterized in <ref> [Biswas 1994] </ref>. The performance of LLAs compares favorably to digital equivalents [Montante 1994, Montante 1995]. Research in beam instrumentation and control is reported in the proceedings of various workshops held on the topic. <p> PISCES, a material-level device simulator, has been suggested to simulate the conductive sheet and its interactions with the input and output contacts [Dutton/Yu 1993]. 4. The LLA retina and digitally-reconfigurable function generator Operational LLA circuits for the retina and various function generators have been previously fabricated <ref> [Mills 1992, Biswas 1994, Montante 1995] </ref>.
Reference: [Brown/Carey/Iselin 1977] <author> TRANSPORT: </author> <title> A Beam Optic Modeling Program. </title>
Reference-contexts: The control signals from the EAC tests will be compared to the signals actually used to control the selected magnets. Measured beam trajectories from live runs, the trajectory computed by the beam modeling program TRANSPORT <ref> [Brown/Carey/Iselin 1977] </ref>, and the trajectory resulting from simulated operation of the VLSI EAC controller will be compared. The "smoke" test of the beam controller is installation of a single controller on a BPM-magnet pair, and operation during a live beam run. 5.

Reference-contexts: A VLSI EAC does not use a CPU or op-amps to perform arithmetic and logic functions, but subsumes these functions by combining conductive sheets with programmable Lukasiewicz logic arrays. Conductive sheets and diode function generators that are similar to LLAs were used separately in previous analog computers <ref> [Karplus 1958, Hausner 1971, Korn/Korn 1964] </ref>. EACs are more flexible than conductive sheets alone or their discretized versions, resistive meshes [Harris/Koch/Luo/Wyatt 1990].

Performance of the controller will be evaluated using the analog test board <ref> [Montante 1994] </ref> and data files obtained during live beam line operation before installing them on the IUCF beam line. The output of EACs from different MOSIS fabrication runs will be compared to determine the mean and standard deviation of the control signals computed.

Reference-contexts: The EAC solves the inverse of the electromagnetic wave equation, "looking" at the resulting surface with an LLA retina to locate the beam's position, then generating the magnet control signal with two digitally-programmable LLA function generators. 2.

Reference-contexts: A foam conductive sheet was built that generated surfaces combining the inverses of the zeroth (intensity), first (position), and second (aspect) beam moments from simulated BPM data (Figure 2). The mathematical basis for the foam's computation is the equation for wall current density induced in the BPM sensors <ref> [Yin 1990, Yin/Rawnsley/Mackenzie 1994] </ref>. Because the BPMs in use at the IUCF have only four sensors, second moments are not uniquely determined unless the beam is highly elliptic along either the X or Y axis of the BPM sensor pairs.
