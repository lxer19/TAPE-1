Abstract: Formal models of animal sensorimotor behavior can provide effective methods for generating robotic intelligence. In this paper we describe how schema-theoretic models of the praying mantis are implemented on a hexapod robot equipped with a real-time color vision system. The model upon which the implementation is based was developed by ethologists studying man-tids. This implementation incorporates a wide range of behaviors, including obstacle avoidance, prey acquisition, predator avoidance, mating, and chantlitaxia behaviors.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Ecological robotics refers to incorporating aspects of the relationship a robot maintains with its environment into its control system (i.e., its ecology) <ref> [4] </ref>. One means for developing such a control system is by exploiting models of behavior developed by ethologists or neuroscientists. <p> Although some work has been undertaken within the artificial life arena [10, 11], almost all of this work has been conducted in simulation or at best on primitive robotic implementations. In this paper we expand upon our earlier simulation studies reported in <ref> [4] </ref> and report results obtained on the implementation of a model of praying mantis behavior on a robotic hexapod equipped with a real-time vision system. <p> Our research has focussed on ethological models of visuomotor behavior for the praying mantis. An ethogram for this creature appears in Figure 1 <ref> [4] </ref>. It encompasses a wide range of behaviors ranging from exploration, locomotion, rest, eating, mating, and defensive activities. <p> These were further integrated with obstacle avoidance and chantlitaxia behaviors. Results that were earlier demonstrated in simulation <ref> [4] </ref> are now shown on a fielded real-time vision-based hexa-pod. These efforts demonstrate the feasibility of importing models from the biological community into robotics and show that species-specific activities can lead to interesting robotic performance.

Reference-contexts: This simplified model, depicted in Figure 2, serves as the basis for the implementation described in this paper. It is derived from a model of praying mantis behavior developed by Cervantes-Perez <ref> [7] </ref>. (Figure 3). This model makes a weak commitment to an action-selection mechanism (modeled as lateral inhibition in Fig. 3) for arbitration between prey acquisition, predator avoidance, and mating using a colony-style architectural strategy [9] for arbitration between the winner of the motivated behaviors, obstacle avoidance, and chantlitaxia. <p> Initially, the values of each of these variables is zero. The hunger and sex-drive levels increase architecture suppression. The interactions of the modules is based on a model of the praying mantis's behavior developed by Cervantes-Perez <ref> [7] </ref>. linearly with time, with the hunger increasing at twice the rate as the sex-drive. When the robot has contacted a prey or mate, the robot is considered to have eaten or mated with the object, and the relevant variable resets to zero.

Reference-contexts: It encompasses a wide range of behaviors ranging from exploration, locomotion, rest, eating, mating, and defensive activities. From this model, we have implemented a subset of these behaviors including simple locomotion incorporating obstacle avoidance, prey acquisition (for eating), predator avoidance (for survival), mating, and chantlitaxia behavior <ref> [8] </ref>, where the agent searches for a hospitable environment, which in the case of the mantis is low brush or bushes when young and trees when older.

This part of the model runs entirely on the processor in the Hermes II. Each level contributes in determining the overall behavior of the robotic agent. The output of higher-level behaviors can override the output from a lower-level behavior.
