Abstract: Social commitments have long been recognized as an important concept for multiagent systems. We propose a rich formulation of social commitments that motivates an architecture for multiagent systems, which we dub spheres of commitment. We identify the key operations on commitments and multiagent systems. We distinguish between explicit and implicit commitments. Multiagent systems, viewed as spheres of commitment (SoComs), provide the context for the different operations on commitments. Armed with the above ideas, we can capture normative concepts such as obligations, taboos, conventions, and pledges as different kinds of commitments. In this manner, we synthesize ideas from multiagent systems, particularly that of social context, with ideas from ethics and legal reasoning, specifically that of directed obligations in the Hohfeldian tradition.

Reference-contexts: A pleasant side-effect of taking a broader interpretation is that it helps in unifying several important normative concepts. We will follow our program here, and defer a detailed discussion of the literature till section 5. Our approach treats commitments as first-class abstract objects with names <ref> (Asher, 1993) </ref>. Naming enables self- and cross-reference among the commitments. We think of commitments as being toward conditions to be achieved rather than actions.

Reference-contexts: O6. Assign transfers a commitment to another creditor within the same context, and can be performed by the present creditor (if authorized) or the context. Interestingly, except for discharge, these can be, and typically are, performatives <ref> (Austin, 1962) </ref> of the debtor, creditor, or context. This is because the debtor can unilaterally create or cancel commitments by performing the right illocutions (under appropriate circumstances), but cannot always discharge a commitment by just saying so.

Reference-contexts: This is important, because the only kind of common knowledge in a real system is what is present without having to be created by communications <ref> (Chandy & Misra, 1986) </ref>. Explicit interactions rely for their meaning upon explicit commitments among the communicating agents. Consider the different classes of illocutionary acts (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969). For example, commissives ordinarily bring into effect a commitment by the speaker to the hearer.

Reference-contexts: Here, the debtor is the agent who is committed, and the creditor is the agent who receives the commitment. The creditor need not be the direct beneficiary. For example, in Japanese society, obligations to one's children (beneficiaries) are repayment of debts to one's parents (creditors) <ref> (Edel, 1961, p. 330) </ref>. However, we will assume that the creditor can be treated as the beneficiary for all practical purposes. We revisit this assumption in section 5. The discharge condition is the condition committed to. Each commitment exists in a (social) context.

Reference-contexts: Dunin-Keplicz & Verbrugge study this and related notions, also summarizing some previous work (1996).

(Barwise (1989a) compares three alternative formulations of mutual beliefs, but these are essentially similar for our purposes.) Here we use MB to notate mutual belief.

Reference-contexts: The idea that the group of agents has sovereignty over its members is basic to democracies. Also, in democracies, the group collectively delegates its powers to its representative, the government|typically, itself a group <ref> (Morse, 1995a, p. 221) </ref>. Previous approaches to commitments have only looked at context-sensitivity with respect to propositions that define potential exception conditions. For example, you may be obliged to lending someone your car, but not if he is drunk. <p> By showing power and immunity as affirming or negating metacommitments, they also reflect the legal intuition that claim and privilege are a more direct component of Hohfeld's analysis than power and immunity, a point made by Fuller, cited in <ref> (Morse, 1995a, pp. 244-245) </ref>. Hohfeld argued that "strictly fundamental legal relations" cannot be satisfactorily formalized (p. 36). We showed how these fundamental relations can be replaced by the single one of commitment, which although not formally defined can help unify the definitions of the others. 4.3.

Reference-contexts: It defines operations on commitments and groups, distinguishes implicit and explicit commitments, and models social policies as higher-order commitments. To help appreciate our approach, we first lay out our main conceptual assumptions: A1. Agents can be structured, and are recursively composed of heterogeneous individuals or groups of agents <ref> (Singh, 1991a) </ref>. A2. Agents are autonomous, but constrained by commitments|or we would have chaos! A3. Social commitments cannot be reduced to internal commitments, which apply within an agent|the relationships among these concepts cannot be definitional (Singh, 1991b). A4. <p> For example, Glaser and Morignot (1997) study reinforcement learning for reorganizing societies, although they do not focus on commitments per se. 5 3.1.1. Explicit versus Implicit We previously proposed that the structure of a group is given by the constraints on the interactions among its roles <ref> (Singh, 1991a) </ref>. We elaborate the interactions somewhat differently now. We distinguish two main kinds of commitments|explicit and implicit|which are intimately related to two main kinds of interactions, termed strategic and reactive in (Singh, 1991a). Explicit commitments are explicitly represented by one or more of the agents; implicit commitments are not. <p> proposed that the structure of a group is given by the constraints on the interactions among its roles <ref> (Singh, 1991a) </ref>.

We conjecture that named groups and commitments can provide the necessary connections among the agents. We also conjecture that as groups become established, their interactions become routinized and their commitments become implicit. This leads to greater efficiency and reduced flexibility.

Reference-contexts: We think of commitments as being toward conditions to be achieved rather than actions. In this way, we borrow from the tradition of von Wright (1963), continued in philosophy by Segerberg (1989) and common in much computer science research on actions and intentions, e.g., our own previous work <ref> (Singh, 1994) </ref>. However, conditions correspond to high-level actions. Using conditions facilitates nesting commitments and constructing "higher-order" commitments (defined below) easily. An agent's commitments typically constrain him to act in accordance with them. A commitment is discharged when the desired condition is obtained.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Social commitments are crucial to the science of multiagent systems. They are also crucial to the engineering of robust and flexible multiagent systems, e.g., in applications in open systems <ref> (Singh, 1997) </ref>. Although good progress has been made, current theories of commitment fail to cover the full range of normative and organizational phenomena of interest.
