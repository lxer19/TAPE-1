Abstract: Semi-infinite linear programs often arise as the limit of a sequence of approximating linear programs. Hence, studying the behavior of extensions of linear programming algorithms to semi-infinite problems can yield valuable insight into the behavior of the underlying linear programming algorithm when the number of constraints or the number of variables is very large. In this paper, we study the behavior of the affine-scaling algorithm on a particular semi-infinite linear programming problem. We show that the continuous trajectories converge to the optimal solution but that, for any strictly positive step, there are starting points for which the discrete algorithm converges to nonoptimal boundary points.

Reference-contexts: So, let i = 2i=m and consider the following approximating 1 linear program: Minimize x 2 subject to x 1 cos i + x 2 sin i 1; 1 i m: (1:2) The affine-scaling algorithm applied to this problem can be described as follows (see, e.g., <ref> [7] </ref> for a derivation of the inequality form of the algorithm from the standard form).

Reference-contexts: For multiples of 4, the problems are dual degenerate but primal nondegenerate and hence the results in <ref> [8] </ref> show that for starting points lying below the x 1 axis convergence to optimality again holds for all 0 &lt; fl &lt; 1.) Hence, there is a discontinuity in the behavior of the discrete affine-scaling algorithms as one passes from linear programs to semi-infinite programs.
