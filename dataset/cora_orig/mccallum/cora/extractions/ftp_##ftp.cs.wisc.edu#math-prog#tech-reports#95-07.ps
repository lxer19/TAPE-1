Title: ENGINEERING AND ECONOMIC APPLICATIONS OF COMPLEMENTARITY PROBLEMS  
Author: M.C. FERRIS AND J.S. PANG 
Abstract: This paper gives an extensive documentation of applications of finite-dimensional nonlinear complementarity problems in engineering and equilibrium modeling. For most applications, we describe the problem briefly, state the defining equations of the model, and give functional expressions for the complementarity formulations. The goal of this documentation is threefold: (i) to summarize the essential applications of the nonlinear complementarity problem known to date, (ii) to provide a basis for the continued research on the nonlinear complementarity problem, and (iii) to supply a broad collection of realistic complementarity problems for use in algorithmic experimentation and other studies. 1. Introduction. As a result of more than three decades of research, the subject

Reference-contexts: Along with the research in the design and analysis of algorithms comes the recognition that the linkage of these algorithms with such mathematical programming modeling languages as GAMS <ref> [18] </ref> and AMPL [49] is extremely important for the algorithms to become easily accessible to practitioners and academic researchers.

Reference-contexts: In general this is a highly nonlinear problem; there are three sources of nonlinearity, the displacement function H, the coordinate chart ( n ; t ; o ),and Coulomb's friction law. The theory of "quasi-variational inequality problem" <ref> [19] </ref> can be applied to study the question of solution existence for this problem. However, there remain a lot of theoretical and algorithmic issues that await treatment. Simplifications of the above model result when one considers the small displacement contact problem coupled with a piecewise linearization of the friction cone.

Reference-contexts: Extensive review and references are also contained in this thesis. Design problems with friction and more general first-level objective functions lead to two-level optimization problems with complementarity constraints that can not be formulated as saddle-point problems; some articles that discuss these applications and their numerical solution include <ref> [26, 171, 145, 185, 186, 99, 100] </ref>. In what follows, we give the formulation of a minimum weight design problem in truss topology optimization with unilateral, frictionless contact.

Reference-contexts: G. Maier and his colleagues from the Italian school [42, 120, 121, 122] were the pioneers in this approach.

In what follows, we consider a discretized, elastoplastic structure undergoing deformation when it is acted upon by external loads.

According to [93], the treatment of frictionless contact problems by a mathematical programming approach dates back to <ref> [28, 50] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There is presently a wide variety of computational methods for solving complementarity problems. Unlike the classical pivotal methods <ref> [29, 66] </ref> and fixed-point homotopy methods [61, 195] that have some well-recognized practical deficiencies for solving realistic equilibrium applications of the complementarity problem [71], many of the contemporary computational schemes are designed with the goal of removing these deficiencies and meeting the need of solving the applications efficiently.

Reference-contexts: The affine version of this problem (that is when all the functions F i are affine) was introduced by Cottle and Dantzig <ref> [30] </ref>; it has been treated in several studies [43, 63, 79, 125].

Reference-contexts: In this context, the complementarity condition is intimately related to the notion of a free boundary; indeed, part of the objective of solving an obstacle problem is to determine this so-called free boundary. Quadratic programming and linear complementarity methods for solving certain obstacle problems have been well documented <ref> [31, 134] </ref>. Obstacle problems that lead to (mixed) NCPs include the obstacle Bratu problem [76, 131] the obstacle von Karman problem [207] and [146, Chapter 7], and several related problems in nonlinear elastic beam theory [60].

Several monographs <ref> [33, 78, 136] </ref> and surveys [71, 149] have documented the basic theory, algorithms, and applications of complementarity problems and their role in optimization theory.

Computational results comparing several algorithms on these test problems can be found in [12]. <p> Although the numerical solution of such a problem by a complementarity algorithm of the pivotal type has been reported, much work remains to be done in order for the recent iterative methods to be applicable. A one-dimensional problem is formulated as a GAMS model in <ref> [38] </ref>. 3.6. Traffic Equilibrium Problems. Underlying all models used for analysis of traffic congestion, there is a transportation network given by a set of nodes N and a set of arcs A. The models are used to predict the steady-state volume of traffic on this network. <p> Optimal Control Problems. We briefly discuss a continuous-time optimal control problem whose discretization results in an ELQP; more details are given in <ref> [38] </ref>. A fixed interval [t 0 ; t 1 ] is divided into n segments, over which control variables u (t) and state variables z (t) are discretized. <p> The tilde notation is used to signify data that arises in the continuous time problem. The GAMS implementation described in <ref> [38] </ref> generates the data elements from the continuous-time problem randomly, with the matrices P and Q being positive semidefinite. While it is possible to express the discrete time problem without using the state variables, their elimination results in a dense problem. <p> A GAMS model for this problem is available in <ref> [38] </ref>. In [193], Tobin describes a spatial price equilibrium in a multi-commodity market modeled as a network. In this example, the variables are the prices at the various nodes in the network. These prices determine supply and demand, and not conversely, as in Harker's model above.

Reference-contexts: For networks of reasonable size, the enumeration of all paths connecting elements of W is prohibitive, if there are many O-D pairs.

Nevertheless, there are path-generation schemes <ref> [54, 75, 155] </ref> that utilize this formulation and generate the paths only if they are needed. The alternative multicommodity formulation to be discussed below completely removes the necessity of enumerating the paths. 3.6.2. A multicommodity formulation.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. As a result of more than three decades of research, the subject of complementarity problems, with its diverse applications in engineering, economics, and sciences, has become a well-established and fruitful discipline within mathematical programming. Several monographs [33, 78, 136] and surveys <ref> [71, 149] </ref> have documented the basic theory, algorithms, and applications of complementarity problems and their role in optimization theory. An important reason why complementarity problems are so pervasive in engineering and economics is because the concept of complementarity is synonymous with the notion of system equilibrium. <p> There is presently a wide variety of computational methods for solving complementarity problems. Unlike the classical pivotal methods [29, 66] and fixed-point homotopy methods [61, 195] that have some well-recognized practical deficiencies for solving realistic equilibrium applications of the complementarity problem <ref> [71] </ref>, many of the contemporary computational schemes are designed with the goal of removing these deficiencies and meeting the need of solving the applications efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Both of these formulations use the Wardropian characterizations of equilibria [204], that may be considered as a special case of a Nash equilibrium (see Subsection 4.3, and <ref> [74] </ref>). Many papers have discussed the formulation and solution of traffic equilibrium problems by the methods of complementarity and variational inequality as well as the applications of these problems in urban planning; see [47, 48, 52, 119, 181]. 3.6.1.

Reference-contexts: For networks of reasonable size, the enumeration of all paths connecting elements of W is prohibitive, if there are many O-D pairs. Thus the above path-flow formulation is not suitable for direct use computationally. Nevertheless, there are path-generation schemes <ref> [54, 75, 155] </ref> that utilize this formulation and generate the paths only if they are needed. The alternative multicommodity formulation to be discussed below completely removes the necessity of enumerating the paths. 3.6.2. A multicommodity formulation.

In general, an MPEC consists of two sets of variables: the "first-level" variable x 2 R n and the "second-level" variable y 2 R m . <p> Since a full discussion of the diverse applications of the MPEC is beyond the scope of this paper, subsequently, we will mention a couple of these applications. We refer the interested reader to the monograph <ref> [117] </ref> for an extensive treatment of the MPEC. 3. Engineering Applications. We divide the engineering problems discussed in this section into several categories: contact mechanics problems, structural mechanics problem, nonlinear obstacle problems, elastohydrodynamic lubrication problems, and traffic equilibrium problems.

Reference-contexts: As opposed to the general equilibrium where the firms choose a quantity to produce, here they choose the price for their single output based on maximizing their profit in the Nash manner. This is called the Bertrand model in the literature. Larger models are found in <ref> [129] </ref>. An extension of this framework is given by von Stackelberg [198]; here it is assumed that one firm is the leader and hence knows that all the other firms will act in a Bertrand fashion. The leader can optimize his quantities using this information to obtain a different solution.

Reference-contexts: For networks of reasonable size, the enumeration of all paths connecting elements of W is prohibitive, if there are many O-D pairs. Thus the above path-flow formulation is not suitable for direct use computationally.

The alternative multicommodity formulation to be discussed below completely removes the necessity of enumerating the paths. 3.6.2. A multicommodity formulation.

Other computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have considered the effect of carbon emission restrictions on international trade <ref> [82, 127, 156] </ref>. Although the conventional first assumption in applied general equilibrium mod eling starts with an assumption of perfect competition, there are instances that result in a monopoly or an oligopoly. An example of modeling with imperfect competition is given in [114]. 4.2. Invariant Capital Stock.

In this context, the complementarity condition is intimately related to the notion of a free boundary; indeed, part of the objective of solving an obstacle problem is to determine this so-called free boundary.

FERRIS AND J.S. PANG One recent area of applications of frictional contact problems occurs in robotics research; see <ref> [10, 11, 152, 154, 161, 177, 196] </ref> and [147, Section 14.1]. In their general form, frictional contact problems are modeled in terms of some abstract mappings describing the contact surfaces and body motions; their formulations are based on continuum mechanics principles. <p> In what follows, we describe two contact problems in a finite-dimensional setting, one in the context of robot task planning and the other pertaining to contact between two elastic bodies. 3.1.1. A dynamic rigid-body model. In the 3-dimensional rigid-body frictional contact model described in <ref> [152, 196] </ref>, a rigid object comes into contact with a number of manipulator links at a finite number of points and the contact forces obey a Coulomb friction law. <p> 9 2 4 b t 3 5 6 4 n _ W T _ J t o 3 7 " _ + 6 W T W T W T 3 5 M 1 0 M 1 # " g man + h man t : We refer the reader to <ref> [196] </ref> for the mechanical interpretation of the entries of the matrix A, the vector b and for a description of the generation of these data from realistic contact problems. <p> Details and numerical results can be found in <ref> [196] </ref>. There is presently no computational study on the quadratic friction cone model. An extension of the models described herein to include soft finger contacts is described in [153].

Reference-contexts: Indeed many of the problems described in the next two sections contain data that are design variables of an MPEC; these applications are therefore the second-level problems of the MPECs. An example is the Stackelberg game problem <ref> [198] </ref> which can be formulated as an MPEC with the second-level VI being a Nash game (see Subsection 4.3). Since a full discussion of the diverse applications of the MPEC is beyond the scope of this paper, subsequently, we will mention a couple of these applications. <p> This is called the Bertrand model in the literature. Larger models are found in [129]. An extension of this framework is given by von Stackelberg <ref> [198] </ref>; here it is assumed that one firm is the leader and hence knows that all the other firms will act in a Bertrand fashion. The leader can optimize his quantities using this information to obtain a different solution.

Reference-contexts: Note that a more general formulation is possible with fewer explicit assumptions on the profit function (p). Two standard results are used to generate a similar formulation to that given above. The first is Hotelling's Lemma <ref> [199] </ref> which states that if the profit function, defined using (4.4) has a unique solution, then it is differentiable and the optimal solution vector (that is the netput supply vector) is r (p). This solution can be substituted into (4.2). Frequently, the result is termed the Envelope Theorem. <p> The complementarity problem that results from substituting this into (4.1) and (4.2) is: 0 p ? r (p)z i=1 (d i (p; w i ) e i ) 0 Another result that enables the skew symmetry to be recaptured is Euler's Law <ref> [199] </ref>. This states that if is a positively homogeneous function of degree 1 and is differen tiable, then (p) = r (p) T p: Many of the remarks above apply per se to this formulation as well. 4.1.3. Taxation and subsidies.

Reference-contexts: G. Maier and his colleagues from the Italian school [42, 120, 121, 122] were the pioneers in this approach. Kaneko [84, 85, 86] and Wakefield and Tin-Loi <ref> [200, 201] </ref> focussed on the linear complementarity approach. The recent papers [27, 123, 190, 191, 192] employed the nonlinear complementarity problem to model nonlinear hardening laws and static-kinematic relations in these structural problems.

Reference-contexts: The balance of supply and demand is central to all economic systems; mathematically, this fundamental equation in economics is often described by a complementary relation between two sets of decision variables. For instance, the classical Walrasian law of competitive equilibria of exchange economies <ref> [202] </ref> can be formulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem in the price and excess demand variables. <p> The scope of economic questions has been extended to include public finance [9], international trade [65, 159, 183] and development planning [1, 36, 62]. Other extensions will be noted in what follows. 4.1. General Equilibrium. A general equilibrium problem (that is commonly attributed to Arrow-Debreu [6] and Walras <ref> [202] </ref>) is to find commodity prices, sector activities and consumer consumption vectors such that: each sector maximizes its profit;(4.1) supply exceeds demand;(4.2) APPLICATIONS OF COMPLEMENTARITY 27 expenditure equals income.(4.3) All these statements make intuitive sense.

Reference-contexts: Optimization is a recurring theme in numerous engineering applications; however, many engineering systems involve the notion of equilibrium without an objective being optimized. For instance, the renowned Wardrop principle of user equilibrium in traffic theory <ref> [204] </ref> has a natural formulation as a nonlinear complementarity system; in this case, the complementarity condition is a behavioral statement about the users of a traffic network who are postulated to take shortest paths in the network. <p> The first model is based on considering all the paths between the origin-destination pairs, and the second uses a multicommodity formulation, representing each origin or destination node as a different commodity. Both of these formulations use the Wardropian characterizations of equilibria <ref> [204] </ref>, that may be considered as a special case of a Nash equilibrium (see Subsection 4.3, and [74]). <p> The model is called a fixed-demand model if each d w (t ) is a constant function; the general model is often called the elastic demand model. The Wardrop equilibrium principle <ref> [204] </ref> states that each driver will choose the minimum cost path between every origin destination pair and through this process, the paths that are used will have equal cost; paths with costs higher than the minimum will have no flow. <p> along arc a, then the corresponding time to deliver that commodity is minimized: 0 c a (f ) + t k i ? x k where the arc flow vector f is given by f k2D This is typically termed "Wardrop's second principle", although it appears first in his article <ref> [204] </ref>. It is clear that given an enumeration of the paths, the solution generated from a path based formulation can easily yield a solution to the multicommodity formulation, and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: Numerical experimentation has always been an important part of algorithmic development. The paper [72] is perhaps the first to report extensive computational results with an algorithm for solving realistic nonlinear complementarity problems arising from various economic applications. This set of test problems has since been augmented in <ref> [57, 107, 150, 206] </ref>; a model library containing a summary of these problems is formulated in the GAMS [38] and AMPL languages [37, Chapter 3]. Computational results comparing several algorithms on these test problems can be found in [12].

Reference-contexts: Quadratic programming and linear complementarity methods for solving certain obstacle problems have been well documented [31, 134]. Obstacle problems that lead to (mixed) NCPs include the obstacle Bratu problem [76, 131] the obstacle von Karman problem <ref> [207] </ref> and [146, Chapter 7], and several related problems in nonlinear elastic beam theory [60]. Typically, these problems are formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces and their discretizations could easily lead to finite-dimensional problems of very large size. <p> Numerical solution of the discretized obstacle Bratu problem is discussed in the two cited references and in several recent papers [24, 39, 57]. In what follows, we give the formulation of the obstacle von Karman problem as given in <ref> [146, 207] </ref>. The von Karman equations are of fundamental importance in the theory of thin elastic plates. The points of the plate are given a fixed, right-handed Cartesian coordinate system 0x 1 x 2 x 3 .
