Abstract: The achievements of SAR-based land-cover classification have progressed rapidly in recent years using data from the JPL AirSAR [1]. With the launches of the European ERS-1 and Japanese JERS-1 satellites worldwide SAR data is now routinely available from a spaceborne sensor. While the previous efforts have been impressive[2], the combination of these two sensors promises even more discrimination ability than either alone. Consequently, it is important to devise a classification algorithm that is robust to variability in seasonal variations, weather, and local vegetation species. This paper presents a first step toward that goal. Several scenes acquired during August, and one during December using ERS-1 were combined with two scenes from August and October from JERS-1, but from different years. Each same-season pair is then combined and classified using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. The August ERS-1 scenes were chosen based on local moisture conditions: some having relatively dry soil and another scene was acquired just after a significant rain storm. The Octo-ber/December pair is used to assess the ability to classify in the fall/winter. Despite the variability in conditions, a single classifier is to be developed that can classify five or six structural classes (bare surfaces, short vegetation, and a few different kinds of trees) with high accuracy. This has been achieved with a single ERS/JERS image with accuracies higher than 90% [3]. Once all the different scenes have been classified the differences betweeen the rules in each of the classifiers is to be related to changes in physical parameters due to rain and the change of season. For example, since the deciduous trees do not have leaves during the winter, the C-band (ERS-1) radar response is quite different in the summer than in the winter. Basic knowledge such as this can be used to adapt the classifier to seasonal changes. fl * Visiting Research Scientist from University of Munich

Reference-contexts: Lastly, the data were log-transformed, so the statistics were more nearly gaussian as required by the Bayesian technique. Hence, the classifier used 3 separate channels as input features: L-hh, C-vv, and L-hh/C-vv. Classification Methodology The classification methodology used here was first developed using JPL AirSAR data <ref> [1] </ref>. It worked well there and is being enhanced for use here. A well-known classification system based on nested levels of detail has been used [6]. A standard Bayesian algorithm is used for the classification procedure.

Reference-contexts: The JERS-1 SAR has been operating since April 1992 and operates at a longer wavelength than the ERS-1 SAR. Taken alone, either instrument has demonstrated deficiencies for classification of land-cover. When used together, the two instruments are found to be very potent tools for this purpose <ref> [3] </ref>. The main reason for this is that the difference in wavelength of the two SARs yields spectral information that can be exploited to differentiate structural properties of surfaces and vegetative covers [4]. This paper presents the methodology used and the results achieved with this sensor combination.

Reference-contexts: As provided, range fading was corrected for at a reference range near the center of the image. We applied a range fading correction to account for the within-scene variation. The antenna pattern correction was applied by using data provided by ESA <ref> [5] </ref>. The scene was then resampled to ground range using a local, smooth GEM-6 ellipsoid model, as given in the image header. The JERS-1 SAR operates at L-band (1.25 GHz, 23.5 cm), hh-polarization, and with a 35 ffi look angle at bore-sight.

A well-known classification system based on nested levels of detail has been used <ref> [6] </ref>. A standard Bayesian algorithm is used for the classification procedure. Briefly, three to four major land-cover classes are distinguished: (1) bare surfaces (water,bare soil), (2) short vegetation (few large trunks), (3) tall vegetation (large trunks), (4) sometimes an urban class, if there is a large city.

Reference-contexts: These structural differences are those that are important for calculating biomass accurately, and so these classified images can later be used to calculate tree biomass more accurately <ref> [7] </ref>. Since very young forest stands appear as short vegetation a biomass threshold of 2.5 kg/m 2 was chosen to separate short from tall vegetation (Fig. 1).
