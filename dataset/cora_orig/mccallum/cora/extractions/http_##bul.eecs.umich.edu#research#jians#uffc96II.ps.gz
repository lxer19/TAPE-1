Abstract: In Part I of this paper, we introduced a new approach for ultrasonic imaging using coded-excitation. Our formulation allows for the implementation of the imaging operator as a transversal filter bank, with each filter designed to reconstruct scat-terer distribution along one image line. This formulation allows for high-speed data acquisition when the reconstruction filters are utilized in parallel configuration. Furthermore, under high SNR conditions, our approach allows for spatial resolution that exceeds the resolution set by the diffraction limit. Ideally, the resolution limit for our system is set by the grid spacing in the region of interest (ROI). However, when the SN R of the system is finite, sensitivity to noise becomes a factor in image reconstruction quality. A trade-off exists between spatial and contrast resolutions, with all elements of this trade-off captured by the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the imaging operator, G. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of Equation (22) in Part I in defining an optimal pseudoinverse operator (PIO). The optimal PIO provides the highest spatial resolution at which the mean-square error (MSE) is minimized. We show that a design procedure for such an optimal image reconstruction operator is feasible and we present an algorithm for operator design. Computer simulations are used to highlight the main features of the SVD-based operator design procedure; the SVD of the imaging operator consists of array-dependent (analytic) and code-dependent (non analytic) modes. The analytic modes yield a sinc-like lateral point spread function (LPSF) of the imaging system. For a given SN R of the imaging system, a maximum number of modes (analytic and nonanalytic) can be used in the design of the imaging operator to minimize the LPSF width (i.e., maximize resolution) while

Reference-contexts: This will significantly improve the SN R of the imaging system compared with the omni-directional receiver approach. We have previously developed a technique for multiple focusing using a single beamformer <ref> [4] </ref>. This approach can be used to design spatial masks that allow the simultaneous acquisition of sparsely distributed image line. This, in turn, allows for the design of very well-conditioned imaging operators. * The implementation of the new approach requires simple modifications of existing systems.

Reference-contexts: In that case, the range resolution of the image is determined by the inverse filtering properties of the pseudo-inverse filters used for system implementation [9]. Similar to the Wiener filter, an enhancement of resolution in range is typically obtained <ref> [5, 9] </ref>. It has been indicated [9] that the lateral resolution of the proposed imaging modality is not subject to the diffraction limit.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the LPSF functions at different ranges in this 2D ROI are almost the same (referring to the LPSF shown Figure 6c). Figure 7b simulates the reconstruction results obtained by using multiple receive beamforming <ref> [8] </ref>. Figure 7c shows the reconstruction results obtained by using the proposed coded-excitation modality. We can see that the new method provides much better lateral spatial resolution in this example. All the figures are displayed over a 40 dB dynamic range in this example. IV. <p> This conclusion may also be true even if the ROI is selected by a wide receive beam created by an apodized aperture (see imaging approach different from the current parallel processing imaging methods <ref> [8, 1] </ref>. In addition, compared with the system utilizing a wide transmit beam and multiple receive beams, the new system may also provide better lateral resolution (as the case shown in Figure 7). <p> We have shown that this procedure minimizes the reconstruction mean square error with simple rank reduction or regularization of the singular modes. Simulation results were used to compare the performance of our proposed approach with conventional parallel receive beam system described in <ref> [8] </ref>. The results clearly indicate the improved detectability of a small cyst and a more granular speckle pattern consistent with the smaller resolution cell of our proposed system.

Reference-contexts: Examples are also given to show the validity of the proposed P IO design method. All the simulations are based on a 3.5 MHz 9 linear array with 128 elements and 0.22 mm element spacing. The coded sequences are selected from a set of 127-chip maximum length sequences <ref> [9] </ref>. Unless stated otherwise, 16 codes are sent out without focus from array elements 3, 11, . . . , 123. These elements span an aperture of 26.4 mm. The 1D ROI used in simulations has a lateral interval [-1.35 mm, 1.35 mm] at range 93.9 mm. <p> The 12 anechoic cyst region shown in the figure has a 16 pixel radius (in sector format dis-play, the cyst is approximately elliptic with lateral axis width (1.8 mm) smaller than the receive beam pattern width created by the full array). As indicated in <ref> [9] </ref>, simple simulation shows that TSR holds along each image direction in the ROI at least 1 cm. Therefore, the LPSF functions at different ranges in this 2D ROI are almost the same (referring to the LPSF shown Figure 6c). <p> However, the choice of transmit aperture should also consider the feasibility of filter implementation of the P IO. Typically, a larger transmit aperture causes a shorter range interval in which the TSR holds for all image directions in the ROI <ref> [9] </ref>. The design example given above has demonstrated the possibility of using the new imaging modality for high resolution imaging applications. Figure 6 shows an optimalized P IO which achieves lateral resolution less than 1.8 mm. <p> High lateral resolution has also been observed in the 2D imaging example shown in Figure 8. In that case, the range resolution of the image is determined by the inverse filtering properties of the pseudo-inverse filters used for system implementation <ref> [9] </ref>. Similar to the Wiener filter, an enhancement of resolution in range is typically obtained [5, 9]. It has been indicated [9] that the lateral resolution of the proposed imaging modality is not subject to the diffraction limit. <p> In that case, the range resolution of the image is determined by the inverse filtering properties of the pseudo-inverse filters used for system implementation [9].

Similar to the Wiener filter, an enhancement of resolution in range is typically obtained [5, 9]. It has been indicated [9] that the lateral resolution of the proposed imaging modality is not subject to the diffraction limit. Indeed, the main beam width of the LPSF associated with an optimally designed P IO is usually much smaller than the width of the ROI defined by the receive beam. <p> For instance, Figures 8b-8c repeats the tests shown in Figures 3a-3b by using the single parameter regularization technique <ref> [9] </ref>. Here, the set of regularization parameters (ffi (m) j m = 1; 2; : : : ; 100g) used in the tests is plotted in Figure 8a.
