Title: Error Analysis of Overlapping Mortar Element Methods for Elliptic Problems  
Author: Xiao-Chuan Cai Maksymilian Dryja Marcus Sarkis 
Keyword: non-matching grid, mortar projection, overlapping domain decomposition  
Abstract: We study some mortar finite element methods for solving two-dimensional elliptic problems discretized on overlapping non-matching grids. We prove optimal error bound for the two-subdomain cases. Numerical examples are presented to support the theory.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The mortar element method was first developed for the purpose of coupling different dis-cretizations in different nonoverlapping subdomains. Some studies have been carried out; see e.g., <ref> [1] </ref> and references therein. In this paper, we consider the case of overlapping sub-domains. We provide an optimal error analysis for two-subdomain cases. A more detailed discussion and the corresponding spectral bound estimate for the Schwarz preconditioned system can be found in [2]. <p> The curve fl i has two sides. We refer to one of them as the mortar side, and the other the non-mortar side. In most mortar element methods, see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>, the choice is rather arbitrary. In our case, we have only one choice. For fl 1 , we define the T h 2 side as the mortar side and the T h 1 side as the non-mortar side.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we consider the case of overlapping sub-domains. We provide an optimal error analysis for two-subdomain cases. A more detailed discussion and the corresponding spectral bound estimate for the Schwarz preconditioned system can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. The main advantage of non-matching grid methods is that highly structured local grids and corresponding fast solvers (and software) can be used easily. To preserve the global accuracy of the discretization, the interpolation between the neighboring subdomains has to be sufficiently accurate. <p> We also show that the error bound is independent of the ratio of the mesh sizes. Another interesting finding is that larger overlap can make the resulting linear system easier to precondition as shown in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Elliptic problems and finite element spaces We are interested in solving the following elliptic variational problem: Find u fl 2 H 1 0 (); such that a (u fl ; v) = f (v); 8 v 2 H 1 put here title put here (eds.), pp. 1-5.
