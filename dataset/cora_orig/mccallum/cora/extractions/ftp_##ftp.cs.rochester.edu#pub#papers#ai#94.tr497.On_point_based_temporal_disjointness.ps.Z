Abstract: We address the problems of determining consistency and of finding a solution for sets of 3-point relations expressing exclusion of a point from an interval, and for sets of 4-point relations expressing interval dis-jointness. Availability of these relations is an important requirement for dealing with the sorts of temporal constraints encountered in many AI applications such as plan reasoning. We prove that consistency testing is NP-complete and finding a solution is NP-hard. fl The work of the first author was carried out in part during a visit at the Computer Science Department of the University of Rochester (NY) supported by the Italian National Research Council (CNR), and in part at IRST in the context of the MAIA project and CNR projects "Sistemi Informatici e Calcolo Parallelo" and "Pianificazione Automatica". The second author was supported by Rome Lab Contract F30602-91-C-0010.

Reference-contexts: In several areas, including planning [3, 4], plan recognition [17, 39], natural language understanding [2, 20, 28] and diagnosis of technical systems [22], temporal information can be specified in terms of qualitative relations between time points or intervals. Allen <ref> [1] </ref> introduced a representation of time and a reasoning method based on thirteen basic relations that can hold between intervals. From these basic relations a relation algebra [29] called Interval Algebra (IA) can be formed [19].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Representing and reasoning about qualitative temporal information is essential for many tasks of Artificial Intelligence. In several areas, including planning [3, 4], plan recognition [17, 39], natural language understanding <ref> [2, 20, 28] </ref> and diagnosis of technical systems [22], temporal information can be specified in terms of qualitative relations between time points or intervals. Allen [1] introduced a representation of time and a reasoning method based on thirteen basic relations that can hold between intervals.

Reference-contexts: minimal requirement is to be able to say that a certain time point (perhaps an instantaneous action, or the beginning or end of an action) must not lie within a certain interval (another action, or the interval between two actions). 4 These relations are fundamental, for example, in nonlinear planning <ref> [6, 23, 24, 30, 40] </ref> where an earlier action may serve to achieve the preconditions of a later one, and no further action should be inserted between them which would subvert those preconditions.
