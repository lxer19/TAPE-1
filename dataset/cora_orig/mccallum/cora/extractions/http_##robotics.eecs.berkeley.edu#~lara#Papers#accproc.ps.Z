Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Driftless nonholonomic control systems have been studied by many researchers in recent years (see e.g. [10] and <ref> [1] </ref>). Several important results have been derived based on the structure of Lie algebras generated by the control vector fields. A dual point of view using exterior differential systems was developed in [9] and [14].

Reference-contexts: Proposition 4 Algorithm 1 solves Problem 1 and converges, provided sufficiently large controls are available, the system is STLC from any x 2 R n , and the condition of Lemma 2 is satisfied. 5. Path planning for the planar diver example A planar diver <ref> [3] </ref> has the structure of a three dimensional La-grangian system with a cyclic coordinate (7), where the func tions a i3 , i = 1; 2; 3, are highly nonlinear (trigonometric). The drift is caused by the constant angular momentum &gt; 0. <p> The steering problem is to lead the diver through the somersaults driven by the actuating arms and legs, and to enter the water in a fully extended vertical configuration. The configuration of the planar diver can be described by = <ref> [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] </ref> T , where 1 is the angle between the legs and the trunk of the diver, 2 is the angle between the arms and the trunk, and 3 is the orientation of the trunk with respect to the vertical axis. <p> Details can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The time T available to complete the dive is predetermined by gravity, the initial vertical velocity, and the distance the center of mass for the diver must fall to reach the water. The dynamic equations for a symmetric diver (modified from <ref> [3] </ref>) are given by _ 1 = v 1 _ 3 = a 13 ( 1 ; 2 ) a 23 ( 1 ; 2 ) where a 13 ( 1 ; 2 ) = [ff + fi cos ( 1 ) + cos ( 2 1 )] a 33 ( <p> A realistic initial condition to use is = [0; ; 0] T and for a 1 1 2 somersault dive, the desired final state is fl = <ref> [0; ; 3] </ref> T .

Reference-contexts: The algorithm uses bang-bang controls to generate trajectories. Controllability is a necessary condition for convergence of the algorithm.

A class of nonholonomic systems with drift Sufficient properties for controllability of this latter class is derived in this section.

The search for canonical forms <ref> [10] </ref> defined the chained form, which has since gained much popularity. This paper investigates a class of Lagrangian systems with a cyclic coordinate as a step toward extending the understanding of control of systems with drift terms. The eventual goal is an increased repertoire of canonical forms.
