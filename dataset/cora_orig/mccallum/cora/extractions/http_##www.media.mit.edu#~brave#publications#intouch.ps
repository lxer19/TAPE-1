Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach for applying haptic feedback technology to interpersonal communication. We present the design of our prototype inTouch system which provides a physical link between users separated by distance.

Reference-contexts: Haptics is often applied in these systems to improve the performance of the operator by translating forces, imparted on the robot by the CHI 97 Extended Abstracts environment, back to the control device <ref> [1] </ref>. Such systems can be used in a way similar to that suggested by inTouch if a second user physically interacts with the robot directly.

Reference-contexts: Two geographically distant people can then cooperatively move the rollers, fight over the state of the rollers, or more passively feel the other persons manipulation of the device. The presence of the other person is thus made tangible <ref> [2] </ref> through physical interaction with the seemingly shared object. Since the two objects are not mechanically linked in reality, inconsistencies in their states must be resolved by the system agreeing on a single consistent state and then employing the motors to guide the objects into that state.

Reference-contexts: First, rollers can be rotated in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction indefinitely. Unlike a joystick or throttle, for example, where the motion of the device is bounded, the roller affords <ref> [3] </ref> more fluid and continuos strokes. Although the roller has the potential to be manipulated aggressively, thrashing between bounds is not possible. For this reason, we felt that the motion of the roller was more appropriate for the expression of subtle emotional states than a bounded motion.

Reference-contexts: In close personal relationships, such as family and friends, touch is particularly important as a communicator of affection. Current interpersonal communication technology, such as telephones, video conferencing systems, and email, provides mechanisms for audiovisual and text-based interaction. Communication through touch, however, has been left largely unexplored <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper, we describe an approach for applying haptic feedback technology to create a physical link between people separated by distance. The aim is to enrich current real-time communication by opening a channel for expression through touch.
