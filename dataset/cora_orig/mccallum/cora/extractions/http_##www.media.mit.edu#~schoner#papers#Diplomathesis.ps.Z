Reference-contexts: To finish this section we present a simple reconstruction example in order to get a sense of the possible solution space. The system that comes closest to real world vibrating systems such as the violin is the quasi periodic system <ref> [BPV84, P.71] </ref>: Imagine a bi-periodic system 20 t) + sin (2 1185 t). characterized by two frequencies f 1 and f 2 . y (t) = sin (2f 1 t) + sin (2f 2 t) (2:21) Such a system creates a torus T 2 which can be visualized in R 3

Reference-contexts: In extension to the embedding theorem for autonomous systems M. Casdagli <ref> [Cas92, P.266] </ref> and others [Hun92] proposed the following solution for driven systems: y (t) = f (y (t t ); y (t 2t ); :::; y (t (d1)t ); u (t); u (t t ); u (t 2t ); :::; u (t (d 1)t ) (2:9) Casdagli shows that there is <p> The time-discrete version of 2.9 can be written as y (n) = f (y (nk); y (n2k); :::; y (n (m+1)k); (2.10) We sketch a proof for the time-discrete case as done in <ref> [Cas92] </ref>: Let's assume a finite dimensional unknown system determined by its d-dimensional state vector s n and the following set of equations: ~s (n+1) = f (~s (n); ~u (n)) (2.11) If equation 2.11 is true the delay vector ~v n = y n ; y nk ; y n2k ; <p> P can be obtained by plugging ~s into 2.11 and iterating. We summarize: There is a smooth and unique function P for generically all input sequences for m; l &gt; 2d. For m; l = d+1 such a function P exists almost everywhere in the solution space <ref> [Cas92] </ref>. 2.5 Characterization of Dynamic Systems There are classification techniques for dynamical systems that apply to any system, no matter whether linear, nonlinear or chaotic. They all determine invariants of the system, preferably the embedding dimension of an unknown system.

Reference-contexts: In order to improve our understanding we have chosen a representative system known to behave non-linearly, the Lorentz-Attractor one of the most striking examples for non-linear, chaotic behavior. Edward Lorenz tried to approximate Navier-Stokes equations for a convectional system <ref> [Ger88, P.8] </ref> and found the following set of first-order differential equations: _x = (y x) (2.8) _z = fiz + xy domain for the parameter set = 10, fi = 8=3 and = 28 8 and figure 2-1 (b) shows the Fourier-transform of the same time series.

Reference-contexts: The set f i g D i=1 is called the Lyapunov Spectrum, P D i=1 i describes the volume expansion rate. Whenever one or more Lyapunov coefficients become positive, chaotic behavior is observed. The Spectrum is related to the system dimension by the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture <ref> [Ger96] </ref>. Entropy is a further important characterization technique and is also reviewed very briefly. We do not discuss estimation problems and computational issues related to a practical entropy estimator but outline the principle idea.

Reference-contexts: In the context of synthesis, frequency-domain approaches have played the predominant role.

Reference-contexts: This assumption can be translated into a decay parameter which reduces the weight of the old data, whenever new data is considered (see section 4.5.3). A second related general estimation framework is Regularization theory. It has been shown in <ref> [GJP95] </ref> that function approximation can be interpreted and implemented as a variational problem, which takes into account the data as well as prior assumptions about the model, in particular smoothness assumptions. <p> A high indicates that we need to avoid over fitting of noisy data. is to be determined by cross validation with in-sample or out of sample data. <ref> [GJP95] </ref> proposes a general form for the regularizer (f ()): (f ) = R D ~ G (~s) where ~ F (~s) describes the Fourier transform of f (~x) and 1= ~ G (~s) describes a high pass filter. penalizes high frequency partials in the approximation functional.

Reference-contexts: In extension to the embedding theorem for autonomous systems M. Casdagli [Cas92, P.266] and others <ref> [Hun92] </ref> proposed the following solution for driven systems: y (t) = f (y (t t ); y (t 2t ); :::; y (t (d1)t ); u (t); u (t t ); u (t 2t ); :::; u (t (d 1)t ) (2:9) Casdagli shows that there is a diffeomorphic mapping between <p> The probabilistic approach literally reconstructs the solution manifold of the state space by reconstructing its probability density function (PDF). The estimate of the PDF is done with Gaussian basis functions that weight local models over a limited domain of influence.

Reference-contexts: It has been applied to simple unsupervised learning in pattern recognition and machine learning problems. It was generalized to more complex systems such as hierarchical expert models <ref> [JJ93] </ref> and to Hidden Markov Models. Each iteration of EM consists of an Estimation (E) and a Maximization (M) step. The E-step evaluates a probability distribution for the data given the model parameters form the previous iteration. <p> In terms of space hierarchy we propose a general framework as sketched in figure 4.5.1. The expert system comes close to the framework of gated experts [WMS95] and of hierarchical experts <ref> [JJ93] </ref>. Yet, there is some significant difference. Both of the cited model architectures are basically unsupervised learning approaches for prediction problems, that let the network partition the space autonomously. Partitioning is mainly done in the input space. No a priori meaning is associated with different experts. <p> A general learning algorithm in form of the EM algorithm or in form of explicit parameter search could be defined, but becomes almost impossible to understand without a concrete application (see <ref> [JJ93] </ref>. We therefore prefer to present a learning framework once a specific model architecture is defined (chapter 5). 4.5.2 Hierarchical Cluster Structures As has been seen, our learning algorithms suffered from the fact, that all the training points and all the basis functions were related. <p> E- and M-step are repeated until convergence. It might be possible to add new data sets, before a model has completely been converged. The update rules for hierarchical clusters would obviously be more complex, but there is an analytical solution as well.

However, convergence has been investigated in related contexts. In fact, our model could be interpreted as a special candidate of mixture experts, the convergence of which in fact has been proved <ref> [JJ93] </ref>. 73 Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.5 Zu einer Antwort, die man nicht aussprechen kann, kann man auch die Frage nicht aussprechen.

Reference-contexts: They work well for linear deterministic systems and for fully stochastic systems. However linear description techniques break down in the region between these two unlikely limits [Ger97], and unfortunately all three descriptions break down under the same conditions <ref> [Met96] </ref>. In fact, none of the above description techniques is any useful for non-linear systems. Although the concept of state-space is still meaningful, there is no compact description in the form of matrices that relates these states. <p> All these terms are present in the model, including the constant term e 0;d , for which all the exponents e ki = 0.
