Abstract: As a confluence of data mining and WWW technologies, it is now possible to perform data mining on web log records collected from the Internet web page access history. The behaviour of the web page readers is imprinted in the web server log files. Analyzing and exploring regularities in this behaviour can improve system performance, enhance the quality and delivery of Internet information services to the end user, and identify population of potential customers for electronic commerce. Thus, by observing people using collections of data, data mining can bring considerable contribution to digital library designers. In a joint effort between the TeleLearning-NCE project on Virtual University and NCE-IRIS project on data mining, we have been developing the knowledge discovery tool, WebLogMiner, for mining web server log files. This paper presents the design of the WebLog-Miner, reports the current progress, and outlines the future work in this direction.

Reference-contexts: Notice since a large number of the cells in the cube can be empty, to handle sparse cubes efficiently, sparse matrix technology should be applied in data cube construction [13, 20]. There have been many methods proposed recently for efficient computation of data cubes, such as <ref> [1, 20] </ref>, which is beyond the scope of this study. Examples of dimensions in our web log data cube include the following. <p> Since most data mining functions other than time-series analysis share many commonalities with the work in traditional data mining systems, such as IBM Intelligent Miner (Quest) <ref> [1] </ref>, Silicon Graphics Mine-Set [3], DBMiner [10], this paper will not discuss the application of these data mining functions to web log mining in detail.

Reference-contexts: Different assumptions are made for each of the web log analysis tools resulting in the prospect of different statistics with the same log file. It has been reported in <ref> [2] </ref> that the analysis of the same web log with different web log analysis tools ended up with different statistic results. Overall, the current web log analysis tools are still limited in their performance, the comprehensiveness and depth of their analyses, and the validity and reliability of their results.

The recent progress and development of data mining and data warehousing has made available powerful data mining and data warehousing systems <ref> [6, 4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Recent research and development of data mining technology have promoted some studies on efficient data mining for user access patterns in distributed systems, referred to as mining path traversal patterns <ref> [5] </ref>. Understanding user access patterns in a web site using these mining techniques not only helps improve web system design, but also leads to wise marketing decisions (e.g. putting advertisements in proper places, classifying users, etc.).

One innovative study has proposed adaptive sites: web sites that improve themselves by learning from user access patterns [14]. <p> Researchers working on web log analysis discredit the use of web access counts as indicators of user interest or measure of the interestingness of a web page. Indeed as described by Fuller and deGraaff in <ref> [7] </ref>, access counts, when considered alone, can be misleading metrics. For example, if one must go through a sequence of documents to reach a desired document, all documents leading to the final one get their counters incremented even if the user is not interested in them at all.

With the accumulation of the discovered sequences and periods, analysis can be performed on them to discover patterns and trends with different interests. One kind of patterns which can be easily discovered is the repetition of similar web page accesses.

Our focus will be on time-series analysis because web log records are highly time-related, and the goals of data mining with web log records are largely aimed at mining time-related patterns. <p> The first several kinds of data mining tasks have been discussed in our previous data mining research papers, such as <ref> [10, 11, 12] </ref>. Due to the limited space, the examples analyzed here are all related to the last data mining task: time-series analysis. <p> Such metadata specification standards could lead to the construction of generic tools for data cleaning and data transformation. We are still in the implementation process of a We-bLogMiner prototype. We plan to integrate the technology developed for our data mining system DBMiner <ref> [10] </ref> in WebLogMiner and use DBMiner's sparse data cube capabilities, and develop additional modules for time-series pattern analysis.

This probability is calculated based on the event frequency and event sequence. For example, the probability that one would re-start V-Groups after listing all messages is 0.2 for this group of users.
