Abstract: We consider an extension of the horizontal linear complementarity problem, which we call the extended linear complementarity problem (XLCP). With the aid of a natural bilinear program, we establish various properties of this extended complementarity problem; these include the convexity of the bilinear objective function under a monotonicity assumption, the polyhedrality of the solution set of a monotone XLCP, and an error bound result for a nondegenerate XLCP. We also present a finite, sequential linear programming algorithm for solving the non monotone XLCP.

Reference-contexts: Since these assumptions are considerably more general than the column monotonicity property (for one thing, M and N need not be square matrices), the SLP procedure is applicable to a broader class of XLCPs than the (square) monotone class. The algorithm described below was formulated in <ref> [1] </ref> and its finite termination was established for bilinear programs, not necessarily convex. We 9 shall rephrase the algorithm for the BLP (M; N; C) and use the convergence results from the reference to establish its finite termination. <p> Hence f (x i ; y i )g has at least one accumulation point (x; y) which must satisfy the minimum principle necessary optimality condition <ref> [1, Theorem A.1] </ref>, and hence the KKT conditions for the BLP (M; N; C). By assumption, it follows that (x; y) solves the XLCP (M; N; C). Consequently, x T y = 0. <p> By assumption, it follows that (x; y) solves the XLCP (M; N; C). Consequently, x T y = 0. By <ref> [1, Theorem A.2] </ref>, a vertex (u i ; v i ) generated by the SLP algorithm solves the BLP (M; N; C) with zero minimum. Hence this vertex also solves the XLCP (M; N; C). <p> In turn, this easily implies that (t x 1 + (1 t )x 2 ) T (t y 1 + (1 t )y 2 ) = 0 for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Thus, the convexity of SOL (M; N; q) follows. Conversely, suppose that (M; N ) is not column monotone.

Reference-contexts: In particular, our goal in this paper is twofold: one, to derive some basic results of the HLCP along the line of the classical LCP <ref> [3] </ref>; and two, to present an alternative solution method for the HLCP (particularly, for the "nonmonotone" problems). The problem we shall study in this paper is defined as follows. <p> The latter quadratic program is <ref> [3] </ref> minimize x T (q + M x) subject to x 0; q + M x 0: (1) One important distinction between this program and the BLP (M; N; C) is that the former is defined by the variable x only, whereas the latter involves the pair (x; y). <p> If the HLCP (M; N; q) is feasible, then in a finite number of iterations, the SLP algorithm will produce a vertex solution of this HLCP. Inspired by the class of (row/column) sufficient matrices <ref> [3, Section 3.5] </ref>, we can broaden the class of monotone product pairs of matrices.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, by the well-known Frank-Wolfe Theorem of quadratic programming <ref> [5] </ref>, the BLP (M; N; C) always has an optimal solution provided that it is feasible. Of course, it is in general not necessary for an optimal solution of the BLP (M; N; C) to have zero objective value. <p> In essence, this algorithm is a modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving the BLP (M; N; C) as a quadratic program, whose convergence was originally proved for convex functions <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Q.E.D. The polyhedral representations (7) and (8) allow us to obtain some error bounds for the monotone HLCP. Although some such bounds have been obtained in <ref> [8] </ref> for the general HLCP, they are valid only for test vectors that lie in a compact set. In what follows, we shall use (8) to obtain a sharpened error bound for the nondegenerate, monotone, HLCP.

Reference-contexts: We observe that SOL (M; N; C) is a convex set by (a). Since the BLP (M; N; C) is a quadratic program and the set of optimal solutions of any quadratic 6 program is equal to the union of a finite number of convex polyhedra <ref> [9] </ref>, the convexity of SOL (M; N; C) must imply its polyhedrality. Q.E.D. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1, it is possible to give an explicit (polyhedral) representation for SOL (M; N; C).

When m = n and C consists of a singleton, condition (3) is equivalent to the column monotonicity of the pair (M; N ), which in turn is equivalent to two conditions: (i) M + N is nonsingular, and (ii) M N T is positive semidefinite <ref> [12, Theorem 6] </ref>. By this characterization, it is easy to construct pairs of matrices (M; N ) for which M N T is positive semidefinite but (M; N ) is not column monotone. <p> A pair of matrices (M; N ) with the property that M N T is positive semidefinite will be called a monotone product pair. Unlike a column monotone pair, a monotone pair (M; N ) need not contain any nonsingular column representative matrix (as defined in <ref> [12] </ref>). 3 Monotone Problems We say that a pair of n fi n matrices (M; N ) is monotone with respect to the polyhedral set C R n , or in short, (M; N; C) is a monotone triple, if the implication (3) holds. (Note that this definition requires that M <p> Q.E.D.

In <ref> [12] </ref>, a pair of square matrices (M; N ) was defined to be row monotone if (M T ; N T ) is column monotone. We have previously mentioned that a column monotone pair must be (column and row) sufficient. <p> We have previously mentioned that a column monotone pair must be (column and row) sufficient. Nevertheless, a row monotone pair need not be either column or row sufficient. Indeed, borrowing from <ref> [12, Example 2] </ref>, let us consider the pair M = 3=2 1=2 # " 1 0 ; which is obtained by transposing respectively the matrices C and D in the cited example. <p> Column sufficiency is violated with u = (2; 0); v = (1; 5); whereas row sufficiency is violated with u = (1=2; 1=2); v = (1; 0): The reason for this dichotomy is that the definition of row monotonicity in <ref> [12] </ref> was tailored for the vertical LCP and was not shown to have any relation to the HLCP. On the other hand, the column and row sufficiency defined herein have direct implications for the HLCP.
