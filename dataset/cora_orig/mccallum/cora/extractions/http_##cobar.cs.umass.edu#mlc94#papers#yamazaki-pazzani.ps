Title: A Cluster Analysis Approach to Learning a Semantic Hierarchy for Machine Translation

Abstract: This paper presents a method for learning a semantic hierarchy. The semantic hierarchy is used to bias the learning of rules for translating Japanese verbs to English. The creation of a semantic hierarchy is a form of constructive induction, since the nodes in the hierarchy may be regarded as new predicates that enable more accurate translation rules to be learned. Our experimental results show that a semantic hierarchy learned by our method is useful in learning translation rules for Japanese verbs.

Reference-contexts: This metric is often utilized in the natural language processing studies [Resnik 1990]. A matrix is created to store the value of the mutual information gain measure 2 for all terms. 3 Then, a standard statistical clustering algorithm, the average-linkage method <ref> [Aldenderfer & Blashfield 1984] </ref> is used to create a hierarchy. The procedure of creating a hierarchy by this method is described as follows: 1. It searches the dissimilarity matrix to find a pair of categories which has the highest value. 2.

Reference-contexts: In a previous research, we have investigated the application of inductive learning techniques to the acquisition of translation rules <ref> [Almuallim et.al 1993, Almuallim et.al 1994] </ref>. Experimental results showed that this method was promising in facilitating the construction of rules. However, this method used a semantic hierarchy created by a human expert and did not consider learning this hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Although we use FOCL in our implementation as a tool for learning rules, the methods developed in this paper are more general and can easily be adapted within other learners. For example, an inductive algorithm for learning internal disjunctive expressions <ref> [Haussler 1988] </ref> could be used instead of FOCL. Namely, our method can be applied by using the information about categories appeared in internal disjunctions of the rules learned by this Haus-sler's algorithm.

Reference-contexts: If the more general terms is used in a learned rule, the translation rule would apply to other types of baked goods (e.g., cakes). Although we make no claims of psychological validity for our process of creating a semantic hierarchy, we do note that some psychologists (e.g., <ref> [Nelson 1977] </ref>) have claimed that semantic hierarchies of objects are acquired by children who notice that specific objects can be substituted for each other in certain contexts. Here, we consider that two objects are similar if the same English verb applies to them.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we propose a method of learning a semantic hierarchy by analyzing translation rules learned without a hierarchy. The validity of a semantic hierarchy can be evaluated by learning translation rules, using the semantic hierarchy created by our method. In our implementation, FOCL <ref> [Pazzani & Kibler 1992] </ref> is used as a tool for learning translation rules from examples. Constructing a semantic hierarchy can be regarded as a kind of constructive induction in that the general hierarchy terms serve as new predicates that can bias future learning.

Reference-contexts: Namely, our method can be applied by using the information about categories appeared in internal disjunctions of the rules learned by this Haus-sler's algorithm. Another inductive methods such as decision tree algorithms <ref> [Quinlan 1986] </ref> may also be exploited as an inductive tool if they are modified so that each node of the tree can represented by internal disjunctive expressions. We employed a clustering method with mutual information metric for learning a semantic hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: The mutual information gain measure log (p (c i &c j )=p (c i )p (c j )) is used as a measure of the similarity between two terms, c i and c j . This metric is often utilized in the natural language processing studies <ref> [Resnik 1990] </ref>. A matrix is created to store the value of the mutual information gain measure 2 for all terms. 3 Then, a standard statistical clustering algorithm, the average-linkage method [Aldenderfer & Blashfield 1984] is used to create a hierarchy.
