Title: Finding Accurate Frontiers: A Knowledge-Intensive Approach to Relational Learning  
Author: Michael Pazzani and Clifford Brunk 
Address: Irvine, CA 92717  
Affiliation: Department of Information and Computer Science University of California  
Abstract: An approach to analytic learning is described that searches for accurate entailments of a Horn Clause domain theory. A hill-climbing search, guided by an information based evaluation function, is performed by applying a set of operators that derive frontiers from domain theories. The analytic learning system is one component of a multi-strategy relational learning system. We compare the accuracy of concepts learned with this analytic strategy to concepts learned with an analytic strategy that operationalizes the domain theory.

Reference-contexts: The notion of a frontier has been used before in analytic learning. However, the previous work has assumed that the domain theory is correct and has focused on increasing the utility of learned concepts (Hirsh, 1988; Keller, 1988; Segre, 1987) or learning from intractable domain theories <ref> (Braverman & Russell, 1988) </ref>. Here, we do not assume that the domain theory is correct. We argue that to increase the accuracy of learned concepts, an analytic learner should have the ability to select the generality of a frontier derived from a domain theory.

Reference-contexts: When constructing a clause body, there are two ways that FOCL can add literals. First, it can create literals via the same empirical method used by FOIL. Second, it can create literals by operationalizing a target concept, i.e., a nonoperational definition of the concept to be learned <ref> (Mitchell, et al., 1986) </ref>. F O C L uses F OI L s information-based evaluation function to determine whether to add a literal learned empirically or a conjunction of literals learned analytically.

Reference-contexts: Note that the first three frontier operators derive logical entailments from the domain theory while the last does not. Deleting literals from a conjunction is a means of finding an abductive hypothesis. For example, in EITHER <ref> (Ourston & Mooney, 1990) </ref>, a literal can be assumed to be true during the proof process of a single example. <p> Here, we have shown that these operators result in increased accuracy, so it is likely that a grammar based on the operators proposed here would increase GRENDELs accuracy. FOCL-FRONTIER is in some ways similar to theory revision systems, like EITHER <ref> (Ourston & Mooney, 1990) </ref>. However, theory revision systems have an additional goal of making minimal revisions to a theory, while FOCL-FRONTIER uses a set of frontiers from the domain theory (and/or empirical learning) to discriminate positive from negative examples.

Reference-contexts: However, to obtain a correct learned concept description, FOCL would have to find the same condition independently three times on three different sets of examples. This replication of empirical learning is analogous to the replicated subtree problem in decision trees <ref> (Pagallo & Haussler, 1990) </ref>. This problem should be most noticeable when there are few training examples. Under this circumstance, it is unlikely that empirical learning on several arbitrary partitions of a data set will be as accurate as learning from the larger data set. 3.

Reference-contexts: For example, one might wish to consider operators that negate a literal in a frontier (since we occasionally omit a not from rules) or that change the order of arguments to a predicate. Initial experiments <ref> (Pazzani, 1992) </ref> with one such operator in FOCL (replacing one predicate with a related predicate) yielded promising results. Conclusion An approach to integrating empirical and analytic learning is described.

Reference-contexts: EITHER deals with propositional theories and would not be able to revise any of the relational theories used in the experiments here. A more recent theory revision system, FORTE <ref> (Richards & Mooney, 1991) </ref>, is capable of revising relational theories.
