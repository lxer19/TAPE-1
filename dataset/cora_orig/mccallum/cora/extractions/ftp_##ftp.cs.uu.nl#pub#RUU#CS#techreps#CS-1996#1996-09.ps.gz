Title: Exact Motion Planning for Tractor-Trailer Robots

Abstract: A tractor-trailer robot consists of a carlike tractor towing a passive trailer. Due to its highly nonholonomic nature, the kinematics of this type of robot are complicated and difficult to compute. We present exact closed-form solutions for the kinematic parameters of a tractor-trailer robot and use them to construct an exact and efficient motion planner in the absence of obstacles. This local planner can be employed in a probabilistic global planner, which allows us to plan motions in the presence of obstacles.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, they tend to have problems with incorporating (possibly complex) obstacles. Barraquand and Latombe <ref> [1] </ref> propose a heuristic brute-force approach to motion planning for tractor-trailer robots. It consists of heuristically searching a graph whose nodes are small axis-parallel cells in configuration space. Two such cells are connected in the graph if there exists a feasible path between two configurations in the respective cells. <p> We define a path for a tractor-trailer robot to be a continuous (except for discontinuities of and ff in 0 and 2) function of type <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! C, mapping time t to configurations A path is said to be feasible for a tractor-trailer robot A if and only if it respects A's constraints. 3.1 Simple path constructs Recall that ff represents the orientation of the trailer relative to that of the tractor. <p> When performing a motion along an ff-stable path, the tractor-trailer robot behaves as if it were a single solid body. Lemma 3.1 A feasible path p : t 7! is ff-stable with ff (t) = ff 0 if and only if for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that v (t) 6= 0: (t) = arctan L 2 : 2 Note that ~ evaluates to negative values in Rfor j 0 j &lt; arctan (L 1 =L 2 ). <p> The radius of P, denoted by rad (p), is defined as the (constant) distance between R 1 and (p). We will use rotational paths as `primitive building blocks' of more complex path constructs. Formally, for configurations a; b 2 C we define a function r a;b : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 7! C as r a;b (t) = such that 1. r a;b (0) = a, r a;b (1) = b, and for all t 2 (0; 1) : r a;b (t) 6= b, 2. ff (t) = ff 0 and (t) = stable (ff 0 ), and 3. v <p> We therefore refer to ff-stable paths with bending angle equal to 0 as translational paths. Like rotational paths, translational paths will be used as primitive building blocks for more complex paths. We define a function t a;b : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 7! C as t a;b (t) = , such that: 1. x (t) = x a + t (x b - x a ), y (t) = y a + t (y b - y a ), 3. ff (t) = 0; thus t a;b (t) gives the constant-velocity <p> We refer to stretches with v 0 &gt; 0 as forward stretches, and such with v 0 &lt; 0 as backward stretches. A partial stretch is a connected sub-path of a stretch, in other words: if s : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! C is a stretch, then any function s 0 identical to s but defined only on a closed subinterval of [0; 1] is a partial stretch. A bend is defined as the inverse of a stretch; it moves the robot from a translational to a rotational configuration. <p> A partial stretch is a connected sub-path of a stretch, in other words: if s : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> !

Reference-contexts: introduction to nonholonomic motion planning; a good overview of the general motion planning problem was given by Latombe <ref> [4] </ref>. This paper investigates a particular and well-known nonholonomic system: the tractor-trailer robot. Informally, this robot consists of a carlike tractor towing a passive trailer. The tractor can perform motions that are similar to those of a car: it drives forwards or backwards while possibly steering left or right. <p> For now, consider only the tractor of the tractor-trailer robot, which by itself is a carlike robot. A feasible path connecting two given configurations of the robot can be constructed <ref> [3, 4, 8] </ref> by concatenating three sub-paths: circular arcs around both configurations, and a straight line segment touching both arcs.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the resulting path is inexact because the solution to the nonholonomic constraints is approximated numerically; this implies that the goal configuration is never reached exactly. Our closed-form solution to these constraints would transform their algorithm into an exact planner. Laumond and Simeon <ref> [6] </ref> first compute a holonomic path in the workspace in disregard of the nonholonomic constraints of the robot, and then transform it into a feasible path by means of a local method that respects the robot's nonholonomic constraints. <p> The corresponding motion (a tractrix ) has first been utilized by Laumond and Simeon <ref> [6] </ref> to constructively prove full controllability of tractor-trailer robots. 3 and was previously considered impossible to integrate.

Reference-contexts: A possible way to deal with obstacles in the workspace is by employing this local planner in the learning paradigm proposed by Overmars and Svestka <ref> [7] </ref>. Briefly, their planner incrementally builds up knowledge about the environment by trying to connect randomly generated configurations through a local planner. The key issue in this is that the local planner is not required to always find a path|it is allowed to fail for some configurations. <p> The key issue in this is that the local planner is not required to always find a path|it is allowed to fail for some configurations. This means that a local planner that simply disregards the obstacles can be used and is a viable choice <ref> [7] </ref>. Therefore we try to connect given configurations by constructing a path without taking the obstacles into account. If the robot does not intersect any obstacles along this path, the planner has successfully connected the configurations; it returns failure otherwise.

(A lengthier discussion can be found in the full paper.) We are currently investigating a different path construction to meet 7 this property.
