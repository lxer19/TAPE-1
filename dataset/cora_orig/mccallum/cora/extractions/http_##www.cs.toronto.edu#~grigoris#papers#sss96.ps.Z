Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive model for multi-agent learning based on the metaphor of economic markets, that can cope with the non-stationary and partially observable nature of an information filtering task. Various learning and adaptation techniques i.e. reinforcement learning, bidding price adjustment and relevance feedback are integrated into the model. As a result of this integration learning through the model exploits market competition in order to dynamically construct mixtures of local experts from selfish agents. The model is embedded into SIGMA (System of Information Gathering Market-based Agents) for information filtering of Usenet netnews. The functionality of the system is discussed together with work underway for its evaluation.

Reference-contexts: The SIGMA market model has been implemented as a collection of specialized CALVIN (Communicating Agents Living Vicariously in Networks) agents. The CALVIN agent framework is an open architecture for facilitating the development of highly concurrent, embedded agent-oriented applications <ref> (Ferguson & Davlouros 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Because of their decentralized and local nature, markets can spontaneously be developed for the exchange of goods according to local needs; they can also adjust to unforeseeable changes. Most of the market-like systems that have been developed focus on finding an appropriate agent for solving a single task <ref> (Huberman & Hogg 1995) </ref>. In addition, learning within these systems occurs either by mixing market and heuristic mechanisms for adjusting prices, or by auction mechanisms for determining market equilibrium prices at pre-specified users preferences (Wellman 1994). These design assumptions limit the applicability of those market-like systems to the IF task.

If a PG i agent wins the bid it produces articles that have similarity higher than a particular threshold.

Discussion There are two main reasons for arguing in favor of an economic-based paradigm for IF. One is the intuitive reason of representing the competitiveness for limited resources and pragmatic considerations of costing according to the demand for and quality of information services.

Reference-contexts: FE Agent. Its purpose is to transform raw information contained in an article into a feature-based knowledge representation formalism that can be used to reason about the article. The vector space model (VSM) is used for implementing this formalism <ref> (Salton & McGill, 1983) </ref>. <p> In effect, each FE agent maintains a term frequency table using articles from the newsgroups to which the agent is allocated. The above frequency measures are used to calculate a weight for each term via the tf-idf formula <ref> (Salton & McGill, 1983) </ref>, i.e. (1) The intuition behind this weighting scheme is that terms with high tf-idf values are unlikely to appear in a document by chance.

Reference-contexts: Since an article may be produced by multiple PGs the PS distributes the evaluation feedback in equal proportions to the respective PGs. The term weight vector of the PG i s profile is updated according to <ref> (Salton & Buckley 1987) </ref> (2) where a is the learning rate, r is the reward received from PS and w (t,d) is the term weight vector of document d.
