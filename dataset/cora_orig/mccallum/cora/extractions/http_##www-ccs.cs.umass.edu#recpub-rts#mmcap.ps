Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problems and benefits of developing the infrastructure needed to handle the timing requirements of a real-time industrial control application and the processing of multimedia streams. In particular, this paper explores various application scenarios which can benefit from a real-time control system integrated with multimedia. We propose a high-level architecture based on open systems and identify key research issues at the system and database levels that must be addressed in order to incorporate multimedia capabilities into a distributed industrial control application. A real-time multimedia database is a key component in this platform and it can aid both in real-time control and in the decision making process at the management level, potentially resulting in reduced costs and improved operation of an industrial plant.

Reference-contexts: In addition, further analysis of the information can prevent costly equipment failures, allow more timely maintenance decisions and reduce operational and maintenance costs <ref> [1] </ref>. In order to automate the maintenance process, a real-time multimedia database is essential. <p> One particular example focuses on preventing unexpected failures in large electrical motors. Thermographic images collected using infrared cameras are used to detect hot spots that may indicate clogged air filters, abnormally high current flows, or elevated bearing temperatures <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As more information is integrated with control systems, the question of how a human can keep up with the flow of results becomes critical <ref> [2] </ref>. Expert systems for alarm processing have been implemented to aid the operator when an overflow of alarms occurs. Recently, experimental visualization techniques have been developed [2] with the purpose of enabling a human to understand the output of the control system in a more intuitive way. <p> As more information is integrated with control systems, the question of how a human can keep up with the flow of results becomes critical <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Additional inadequacies of such an architecture are pointed out in [7]. Consequently, these distributed plant control systems are inflexible, expensive, and difficult to modify. The integration of multimedia and traditional real-time applications has been attempted as part of the Mercuri project <ref> [3] </ref> where data from remote video cameras is transferred through an ATM network and displayed using X windows, but they provide only best effort services.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchically layered network: Gateways are employed to connect the information layer and the control layer. The gateways can be a system bottleneck for performance and reliability. Additional inadequacies of such an architecture are pointed out in <ref> [7] </ref>. Consequently, these distributed plant control systems are inflexible, expensive, and difficult to modify. <p> Some of the issues presented here are being investigated as part of ongoing research at A Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation on the MidART middleware architecture for networked real-time industrial systems. MidART <ref> [7] </ref> provides a set of real time network services 14 Chapter 1 and industrial application specific but network transparent programming abstractions, and application programming interface. For example, the selective real-time channels abstraction has been proposed for supporting on-demand transmission of plant data and utilizes network resources efficiently.

For example, a sensor reading a low fluid level at a storage tank can be confirmed with an image of the tank. Similarly, sensors or equipment can easily be identified as faulty using images.

Reference-contexts: While the MIS is logically centralized, it can be physically distributed. Database with Real Time and Multimedia Capabilities The incorporation of multimedia data into control systems presents new challenges in the storage and movement of this time-dependent information <ref> [11] </ref>. That is one reason why the Real-Time Multimedia Database (RTMMDB) is an essential component of the IDS. The RTMMDB is responsible for the storage, transformation and retrieval of multimedia and traditional data collected throughout the plant.
