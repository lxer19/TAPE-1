Title: A Linguistically Based Semantic Bias for Theory Revision  
Author: Clifford Brunk and Michael Pazzani 
Address: Irvine, CA 92717  
Affiliation: Department of Information and Computer Science University of California  
Abstract: We present a new approach to theory revision that uses a linguistically based semantics to help detect and correct errors in classification rules. The idea is that preferring linguistically cohesive revisions will enhance the comprehensibility and ultimately the accuracy of rules. We explain how to associate terms in the rules with elements in a lexical class hierarchy and use distance within the hierarchy to estimate linguistic cohesiveness. We evaluate the utility of this approach empirically using two relational domains.

Reference-contexts: of using a set of examples to identify and repair errors in classification rules (e.g., SEEK 2 ( Ginsberg, Weiss & Politakis 1985), RTLS (Ginsberg 1990), EITHER (Ourston & Mooney 1990), DUCTOR (Cain 1991), AUDREY (Wogulis 1991), FORTE (Richards & Mooney, 1991), R x (Tangkitvanich & Shimura 1992), and PTR+ <ref> (Koppel, Feldman & Segre 1994) </ref>). Traditional theory revision approaches, including all those listed above, operate within a framework in which the semantics associated with a term in a rule is derived from the term's logical definition and the set of examples that definition satisfies.

Reference-contexts: We propose augmenting the traditional framework to include a linguistically based semantics that associates the terms in the theory with elements in a lexical class hierarchy. Ideally, this hierarchy would encode all of the background knowledge of a knowledge engineer <ref> (c.f. Lenat & Guha 1990) </ref>. Because a comprehensive encoding of human knowledge is not currently available, we have focused on using W ORDNET (Miller 1990; Beckwith, et al. 1991), a lexical database containing the relationship between approximately 30,000 commonly occurring English words, as the foundation for our semantics. <p> In both the student loan and moral reasoner domain, the semantics in WORDNET are complete enough to provide a useful bias. We have presented CLARUS using WORDNET as the basis for the linguistic semantics. As other sources of lexical and semantic knowledge become available, for instance CYC <ref> (Lenat & Guha 1990) </ref>, the CLARUS approach will become even more feasible. We chose WORDNET because it was easy to acquire, via anonymous FTP, and simple to interface with. However, it is not clear that the data contained in WORDNET is ideally suited to the theory revision task.

Reference-contexts: The theory to be repaired must contain terms with descriptive names. Without these names, the linguistic-bias offers no assistance in the revision process. For example, W ORDNET does not contain terms that are useful in the promoter theory (Towell 1991) or the King - Rook-King chess theory <ref> (Muggleton, Bain, Hayes - Michie & Michie 1989) </ref>. In both the student loan and moral reasoner domain, the semantics in WORDNET are complete enough to provide a useful bias. We have presented CLARUS using WORDNET as the basis for the linguistic semantics.

Reference-contexts: A limitation of relying solely on example-based metrics is that they often lead to repairs which, though accurate on the training set, combine terms that are not meaningful when used together. For instance in the student loan domain <ref> (Pazzani & Brunk 1991) </ref> it is not uncommon to see a revision system produce a rule that concludes a person is "enrolled-in-more-than-n-units" if that person is "unemployed" or "disabled". <p> Since WORDNET already contains entries for terms that occur in commonly used problems <ref> (Student loans Pazzani & Brunk 1991 and Moral Reasoning Shultz 1990) </ref> we have been able to focus our efforts on the problem of how to use this information. <p> Consider the student loan domain <ref> (Pazzani & Brunk 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There are many approaches related to CLARUS. We have already described its relation to A 3, yet we have not pointed out that the underlying learning mechanism in CLARUS is FOCL <ref> (Pazzani & Kibler 1992) </ref>, which in turn is based on FOIL (Quinlan 1994). CLARUS also borrows ideas from FORTE (Richards 1992), specifically its search strategy, but C L A R U S uses a simpler set of repair operators than FORTE .

Reference-contexts: In a second experiment on the student loan we demonstrate that CLARUS , a theory revision approach, is competitive with purely inductive systems like FOIL <ref> (Quinlan 1990) </ref> and theory-guided inductive systems like FOCL (Pazzani, Brunk & Silverstein 1991; Pazzani & Kibler 1992). In this experiment we compare CLARUS , FOCL and EMPIRICAL.

Instead, it focuses on evaluating competing repairs to the same relation. On the other hand, CLARUS uses a more extensive search strategy, like that of FORTE <ref> (Richards, 1991) </ref>. CLARUS uses A3's assumption mechanism to order the relations according to an upper bound on the potential increase in accuracy a modification to that relation could have.
