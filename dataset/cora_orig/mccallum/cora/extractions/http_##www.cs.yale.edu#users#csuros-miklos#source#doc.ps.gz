Reference-contexts: The idea of integrated documentation was born with the development of the T E X program; it was crystallized in Pascal with the Web system. The advantages of this method are plain to see (it's easy to make comparisons <ref> [2] </ref>). Since this development, systems similar to Web have been developed for other programming languages. But for one of the most complicated programming languages (T E X) the documentation has however been neglected.

But this isn't built in: one has only to redefine some of the following macros to be able to use any other index program. All macros which are installation dependent are defined in such a way that they won't overwrite a previous definition. <p> With the default definitions of "SpecialMainIndex, etc., the index file generated is intended to be processed by Chen's makeindex program <ref> [4] </ref>. Of course, in this package file itself we've sometimes had to make | take the role of T E X's escape character to introduce command names at places where " has to belong to some other category.

Reference-contexts: If your macros "catcode anything other than @ to `letter', you should redefine"MakePrivateLetters "MakePrivateLetters so that it also makes the relevant characters `letters' for the benefit of the indexing. The default definition is just "makeatletter. The `module' directives of the docstrip system <ref> [6] </ref> are normally recognised and"DontCheckModules "CheckModules "Module "AltMacroFont invoke special formatting. This can be turned on and off in the .dtx file or the driver file using "CheckModules and "DontCheckModules. <p> at the start of each macrocode line to check whether it starts with module information. (Such information is of the form %&lt;hswitchi&gt;, where the % must be at the start of the line and hswitchi comprises names with various possible separators and a possible leading +, -, * or / <ref> [6] </ref>.
