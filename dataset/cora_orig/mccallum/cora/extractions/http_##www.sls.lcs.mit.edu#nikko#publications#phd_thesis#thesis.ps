Reference-contexts: The application has sim ilarities to the ATIS domain within the ARPA community, the Voyager system from MIT (Glass et al. , 1995) and European systems such as SUNDIAL (Peckham, 1993), Philipss train timet able information system <ref> (Aust et al., 1994) </ref> and the Danish dialogue project (Dalsgaard and Baekgaard, 1994). Summaries of the WAXHOLM dialogue system and the WAXHOLM project database can be found in (Bertenstam et al. 1995a,b) and an early reference is Blomberg et al. (1993).

Reference-contexts: Summaries of the WAXHOLM dialogue system and the WAXHOLM project database can be found in <ref> (Bertenstam et al. 1995a,b) </ref> and an early reference is Blomberg et al. (1993). The demonstration system is cu rrently mature enough to be displayed and tested outside the laboratory by completely novice users. A successful such attempt was made at Tekniska Mssan (the technology fair) in lvsj in October 96.

Reference-contexts: In order to bridge the r emaining gap between human perception and automatic speech recognition, new innovative solutions may be required. It has been argued that the presence of one dominant technique, that has been tuned for many years, suppresses work along such innovative lines <ref> (Bourlard, 1995) </ref>. CSR is a complex process that naturally breaks down in different subtasks (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: Another alternative approach is the hybrid HMM/ANN method <ref> (Bourlard and Wellekens, 1988) </ref>, where an ANN is used for the phonetic evaluation of the feature vectors. The hybrid HMM/ANN method is used in Paper 3, Paper 5 and Paper 6 of this thesis and is discussed in more detail in the next se ction of this summary. <p> Combinations of an ANN with HMM that models most of the temporal constraints have been more successful. Several different methods have been proposed for combining the two. A few of the more well-known are: Hybrid HMM/ANN Architecture <ref> (Bourlard and Wellekens, 1988) </ref>, Linked Predictive Neural Networks (Tebelskis and Waibel, 1990), Hidden Control Neural Architecture (Levin, 1990), and Stochastic Observation HMM (Mitchel, Harper and Jamieson, 1996).

Reference-contexts: The ease of mo deling such complex systematic variation shared by different phonemes is an i mportant strength of explicitly modeling the speaker variability. An example of a speakersensitive ANN can be found in <ref> (Carlson and Glass, 1992a,b) </ref>, where the acoustic observations as well as the speaker p arameters are input to the network. This study inspired the work reported in Paper 2 , Paper 4 and Paper 5 , where the same basic ANN structure is used.

Reference-contexts: There is ho wever a long way to go from contemporary state-of-the-art recognition systems to a system that is comparable with h uman speech perception. The research on the SWITCHBOARD corpus of spont aneous speech over the telephone is an illustration of this discrepancy <ref> (Cohen, 1996) </ref>. For this task, todays technology is clearly not sufficient. Todays best large vocabulary systems are used for one speaker only, because it is desirable to fine-tune to the speakers voice, and the systems are still vulne rable to noisy conditions.

Reference-contexts: However, using a novel analysis-by- synthesis method, the influence of the automatically extracted parameters was visualized in the fo rmant space. An ensemble of synthetic vowels were generated by a formant synthesizer driven by an LF voice source <ref> (Fant, Liljencrants and Lin, 1985) </ref>. The individual vowels of the e nsemble were varied only in F1 and F2, (the first and second formant freque ncies). The synthetic vowels were then fed to the ANN and the vowel classif ication was recorded.

Reference-contexts: The ASR module of the system, d escribed in detail in Paper 4, has a d omain-dependent vocabulary of about 1000 words. The application has sim ilarities to the ATIS domain within the ARPA community, the Voyager system from MIT <ref> (Glass et al. , 1995) </ref> and European systems such as SUNDIAL (Peckham, 1993), Philipss train timet able information system (Aust et al., 1994) and the Danish dialogue project (Dalsgaard and Baekgaard, 1994).

Reference-contexts: However, recently efforts have been made to make this type of user interface available for developers that are not experts in the area. Central to this development are the modular toolkits that are being developed, e.g., OGIs CSLUsh (Sutton et al., 1996), and MITs Sapphire <ref> (Hetherington and McCandless, 1996) </ref> toolkits. A toolkit in the same spirit is also being developed at the department for Speech, Music and Hearing (Sjlander and Gustafson, 1997).

Reference-contexts: This process operates on a time scale of a few syllables. Speaker adaptation methods have been successfully applied also for ASR. The success should be no surprise, b ecause of the discrepancy in the performance between speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) systems <ref> (e.g., Huang and Lee, 1991) </ref>. Different adaptation methods can be classified by the amount of supervision required from the user and on what timescale they operate. <p> In ASR, the performance gap b etween speaker- independent (SI) and speaker dependent (SD) systems <ref> (e.g., Huang and Lee 1991) </ref> indicates that there is a lot to be gained from adapting SI-models to the speaker. Certainly, the variation due to consonantal context is recognized as an important property of the speech- signal also for ASR. This is usually modeled by context dependent models, e.g., triphones.
