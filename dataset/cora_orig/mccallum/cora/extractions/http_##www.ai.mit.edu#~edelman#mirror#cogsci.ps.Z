Abstract: We present a unified approach to visual representation, addressing both the needs of superordinate and basic-level categorization and of identification of specific instances of familiar categories. According to the proposed theory, a shape is represented by its similarity to a number of reference shapes, measured in a high-dimensional space of elementary features. This amounts to embedding the stimulus in a low-dimensional proximal shape space. That space turns out to support representation of distal shape similarities which is veridical in the sense of Shepard's (1968) notion of second-order iso-morphism (i.e., correspondence between distal and proximal similarities among shapes, rather than between distal shapes and their proximal representations). Furthermore, a general expression for similarity between two stimuli, based on comparisons to reference shapes, can be used to derive models of perceived similarity ranging from continuous, symmetric, and hierarchical, as in the multidimensional scaling models (Shepard, 1980), to discrete and non-hierarchical, as in the general contrast models (Tversky, 1977; Shepard and Arabie, 1979).

Reference-contexts: Superordinate levels. The most challenging problem arises when the system encounters an unfamiliar shape, belonging to none of the classes for which specially trained categorization modules are available. The key to a solution here lies in considering the population response at the basic categorization level <ref> (Edelman, 1995b) </ref>. If the existing modules have sufficiently wide response profiles in the shape space S, a number of modules will respond, effectively representing the similarities between the input and the preferred shape of each module. <p> We refer to the categories for which such modules are available as prototypes; these 4 are defined as C i = arg max CC p i (C). Because a number of modules respond for any given input, the resulting scheme is called a Chorus of Prototypes <ref> (Edelman, 1995b) </ref>. The pattern of responses of the modules to a stimulus X is the ordered list p (X) = fp i (X)g, i = 1 : : : k.

The central problem in determining the identity k lies in the fine resolution that must be attained within the instance space E j , in the face of the residual misalignment left over from the action of the normalizing transformation T .

Reference-contexts: This problem can be approached by learning hyperacuity in the instance space, as it is done in other hyperacuity-related tasks <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992) </ref>; experience shows that hyperacuity can be attained despite considerable misalignment of the stimulus as a whole, relative to its "home" or training pose.

Reference-contexts: The resulting expression for similarity, which provides for the effects of context and 7 for asymmetry, is s (A; B) ~ i=1 sal (p i ; B) (2) Note that this definition has the same form as the additive clustering (ADCLUS) similarity measure of <ref> (Shepard and Arabie, 1979) </ref>, which, in turn, instantiates Tversky's (1977) discrete contrast model of feature-based similarity. At the same time, it is built on top of a continuous metric representational substrate the shape space spanned by proximities to prototypes.

Reference-contexts: Essentially, this is a call for representation of similarity instead of representation by similarity. 1 "Representation of something is an image, model, or reproduction of that thing," <ref> (Suppes et al., 1994) </ref>. We mention below some prominent exceptions to this view. 1 A representation of a collection of shapes is veridical in Shepard's sense, if the mapping it implies between (some parameterization of) the distal shape space and the internal, or proximal, representation space preserves similarity ranks.

Reference-contexts: First, s a is independent of context, whereas perceived similarity depends on the "contrast set" against which it is to be judged. Second, s a is symmetric, whereas human perception of similarity appears to be asymmetric in many cases <ref> (Tversky, 1977) </ref>. To make s a depend on the context, we introduce a vector of weights, one per prototype, such that w i = w i (fA; B; C; : : :g). Thus, 2 This is unlike the case of the three-dimensional view space, parameterized by the Euler angles.
