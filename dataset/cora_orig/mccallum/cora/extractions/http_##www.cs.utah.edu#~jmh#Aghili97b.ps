Abstract: This paper presents a new model for torque generation of synchronous motors and their control based on Fourier coefficients. Since multi-pole motors give rise to high frequency control signals, the dynamics of the current amplifier are no longer negligible. For this case, we present a new commutation strategy which minimizes the torque ripple and the velocity induced change in the torque transfer function. When the amplifier dynamics are negligible, we present a commutation strategy which delivers ripple-free torque and simultaneously minimizes copper losses. The performance of both commutation laws is validated via simulations based on experimental data from a synchronous motor. The approach can be adapted for general brushless motors.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Accurate and high bandwidth sources of torque are essential for the precise position, velocity or force control necessary in many robotics and automation applications. Direct drive motors, and in particular synchronous motors <ref> [7] </ref>, are ideal candidates for this task since they eliminate the nonlinear backlash, friction and cogging effects inherent in mechanical transmissions which can severely compromise performance [2]. However, the production of accurate torque is complicated by the nonlinearity of the motor itself. <p> Motor Characterization Our simulation results in the following section are based on the parameters from the McGill/MIT direct drive motor <ref> [7] </ref>, a synchronous motor with three phases and 18 poles. Both commutation laws require the knowledge of the torque-angle profile. If no torque sensor is available, the spectrum can be extracted by online identification based on back EMF measurements [1].

Reference-contexts: Singular Value Decomposition is a standard technique to deal with such problems <ref> [10] </ref>. The matrix Q can be written as UV T where U and V are orthogonal matrices and is a diagonal matrix whose elements are the singular values of matrix Q. Since the matrix Q is not square, it has to be augmented by adding rows of zeros underneath.
