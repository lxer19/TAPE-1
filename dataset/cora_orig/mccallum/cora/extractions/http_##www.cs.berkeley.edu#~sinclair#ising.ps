Reference-contexts: It is therefore enough to obtain a lower bound on the expectation E 0 (f ). Such a bound is provided by the next lemma, whose proof we defer to the end of the section. Lemma 4 Let 0 and 1 be arbitrary real numbers in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> satisfying 1 &lt; 0 1 + n 1 . <p> be the natural number satisfying n r &gt; tanh fiB n r 1 ; (10) and define the sequence ( k ) for 0 k r + 1 by k = (n k)=n for 0 k r; tanh fiB for k = r + 1. (11) Note that k 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and k+1 &lt; k k+1 + n 1 . Hence by the above discussion we may estimate the ratio Z 0 ( k+1 )=Z 0 ( k ) efficiently for each k . <p> Putting (22) and (23) together establishes the theorem. Remarks (i) The heart of the above proof is the eigenvalue bound (23). This is a discrete analogue of Cheeger's inequality for Riemannian manifolds [5]. Related bounds have been observed by several authors: see, e.g., <ref> [8, 1, 23, 25] </ref>. (ii) Theorem 6 has a converse, which says that if a Markov chain is rapidly mixing then its conductance cannot be too small: see, e.g., [23, 27, 28].

Reference-contexts: Theorem 14 There can be no fpras for Ising unless RP = NP. RP is the class of decision problems which can be solved in polynomial time by a certain type of randomised algorithm which is allowed one-sided errors. (See <ref> [2, p. 138] </ref> for a precise definition.) It is widely conjectured that RP is strictly contained in NP. Thus Theorem 14 can be interpreted as strong evidence that no approximation algorithm exists for the Ising partition function in the non-ferromagnetic, or "spin-glass" case.

Reference-contexts: The leading (non-zero) coefficient of p is twice the number of maximum cut-sets in G. (Note that each bipartition of [n] corresponds to a pair of opposite spin-vectors.) Further completeness results related to the ones in this section can be found in <ref> [3, 15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Markov chain simulation approach to the Ising model is far from new: under the name of the Monte Carlo method, this technique has been applied extensively to a whole range of problems in statistical physics (see, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>). The problem with the approach, however, is that it appears very difficult to define a Markov chain on Ising spin configurations which is rapidly mixing; indeed, the chains which are frequently used in practical simulation studies clearly do not have this property.

Reference-contexts: The output can thus be considered as a fixed-point binary number with an explicit "binary point". Adopting this viewpoint, it is not difficult to locate Ising within the class #P of combinatorial enumeration problems. (See Garey and Johnson's book <ref> [12, p. 167] </ref> for an explanation of #P and its completeness class.) The two problems which form the starting point for the intractability results of this section are MaxCut: 34 Instance: An undirected graph G and a positive integer b. <p> Output: The number of cut-sets in G of maximum size. The following is a slight extension of a known result. Lemma 13 MaxCut is NP-complete, and #MaxCut is #P-complete. Proof NP-completeness of MaxCut is proved in [13]. The reductions used there are not "parsimonious" <ref> [12, p. 169] </ref>, and hence do not immediately imply #P-completeness of #MaxCut. As usual, however, the reductions (given in the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 of that paper) can be modified, without great difficulty, to yield parsimonious versions.

For those who wish to follow the argument in detail, the necessary modifications are presented below.

Reference-contexts: This is an intriguing class of problems, and includes the problems of computing the volume of a convex body [9], the partition function of a monomer-dimer system <ref> [16] </ref> and the permanent of a large class of 0-1 matrices [16]. Our algorithm is also of interest in its own right as a further application of the general technique of simulating an ergodic stochastic process whose rate of convergence can be analysed. <p> This is an intriguing class of problems, and includes the problems of computing the volume of a convex body [9], the partition function of a monomer-dimer system <ref> [16] </ref> and the permanent of a large class of 0-1 matrices [16]. Our algorithm is also of interest in its own right as a further application of the general technique of simulating an ergodic stochastic process whose rate of convergence can be analysed. This approach has recently attracted much attention, and its full algorithmic potential is only now becoming apparent. <p> The phrase "close approximation" will be given a precise meaning in the next section. One strategy which has been applied successfully to problems of this type, and has, for example, been used to estimate the partition function of a general monomer-dimer system <ref> [27, 16] </ref>, involves the simulation of an appropriately defined Markov chain. A direct application of this strategy to the Ising partition function would proceed as follows. <p> This in turn means that we can read off all significant coefficients c k by sampling at appropriate values of , again using Z 0 (1) as a reference value. (An analogous approach was used in <ref> [27, 16] </ref> to obtain the coefficients of a polynomial related to matchings, or monomer-dimer configurations, in a graph.) This method is both more complex and rather less efficient than the one presented in Theorem 5. <p> It is a fact <ref> [16, Lemma 2.1] </ref> that if there is any function : ! R satisfying detailed balance together with the normalisation condition P X2 (X) = 1, then the Markov chain is (time-)reversible, and is its stationary distribution. <p> Appealing to Theorem 6, we conclude that the specified number of simulation steps is enough to ensure a variation distance of at most ffi . The theorem is therefore established. Proof of Theorem 7 The proof rests on a path counting argument, similar to those employed in previous applications <ref> [27, 16] </ref> of the conductance bound. We present a preliminary sketch map of the proof technique before considering the technical details which arise when applying the path counting argument to the particular chain under consideration.

Reference-contexts: We shall take the phrase "with high probability" to mean with probability at least 3=4. This is because a failure probability of 1=4 can be reduced to any desired value ffi &gt; 0 by performing only O (log ffi 1 ) trials and taking the median of the results <ref> [17] </ref>. (This claim is also justified in the proof of Lemma 3 below.) Of course, it is not enough just to obtain an accurate result with high reliability; the result must also be obtained efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we explain how to use samples produced by this procedure to obtain a reliable approximation of Z . Our definition of efficient approximation algorithm is a very demanding one, following Karp and Luby <ref> [18] </ref> and others.

Reference-contexts: A reasonable way to achieve this, and one which is often used in practice, is to allow transitions to occur between spin configurations which differ in just one component, and choose transition probabilities according to the Metropolis rule <ref> [20] </ref>. If the resulting Markov chain is rapidly mixing, that is, if it converges rapidly to the stationary distribution regardless of the choice of initial state, then it can be used effectively to sample configurations from a distribution which is close to the stationary distribution.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, and crucially, there is a natural Markov chain on the subgraphs with the appropriate equilibrium distribution which is rapidly mixing. Thus the Markov chain approach can be made to work efficiently in the new domain. The above transformation is a classical result <ref> [26] </ref>, often known as the "high-temperature expansion" of the Ising model partition function. However, the idea of viewing the graphs in this expansion as a statistical mechanical system which forms the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation appears to be new. <p> Define A = (2 cosh fiB) n Y fi;jg2E cosh fiV ij ; (5) and note that A is an easily computed function of the parameters that specify the Ising system. The following classical result <ref> [26] </ref> relates the two partition functions. Theorem 1 Z = AZ 0 . In recognition of the central role it plays in our algorithm, we present a full proof of this result below.

Reference-contexts: This is a highly non-trivial requirement, 2 since the number of states is exponentially large. Recent developments have provided appropriate analytical tools for establishing the rapid mixing property for chains of this kind <ref> [27, 29, 7, 28] </ref>. The Markov chain simulation approach to the Ising model is far from new: under the name of the Monte Carlo method, this technique has been applied extensively to a whole range of problems in statistical physics (see, e.g., [4]). <p> This dependence on the field is inessential and can be removed with a little extra work (see Theorem 10 of Section 5). (ii) Efficient generators for combinatorial structures, of which the above is a particular example, are discussed in a general framework in <ref> [27, 29] </ref>. The construction of a generator with the above properties, based on simulation of a suitably defined Markov chain, is described and justified in detail in the next section. <p> For an ergodic reversible Markov chain, the conductance <ref> [27, 29] </ref> is defined by = min X2S q (X; X 0 ) X2S where the minimisation is over all subsets S of states with 0 &lt; P X2S (X) 1=2. (Note that 0 &lt; 1.) The conductance in some sense measures the rate at which the process can flow around <p> t : (The requirement that min X p (X; X) 1=2, i.e, that every state has a self-loop probability of at least 1/2, is a technical device which removes periodicity; note that MC Ising satisfies this requirement by construction.) Proof The theorem is essentially a restatement of Theorem 3.4 of <ref> [29] </ref>, to which the interested reader is referred for details; we mention here only the necessary modifications. <p> Note that the presence of a self-loop probability of 1/2 on every state ensures that all eigenvalues are non-negative.) The bound in (22) differs from that on the r.p.d. in Lemma 3.1 of <ref> [29] </ref> only in that (X 0 ) replaces min X (X). Now the main result of Section 3 of [29], Lemma 3.3, relates 1 to the conductance via the bound 1 1 2 =2, valid for an arbitrary reversible chain. <p> the presence of a self-loop probability of 1/2 on every state ensures that all eigenvalues are non-negative.)

Reference-contexts: We will not present a detailed historical account here: a very readable survey is given by Cipra [6], while Welsh <ref> [30] </ref> sets the Ising model in the context of other combinatorial problems in statistical physics. The problem is easily stated. Consider a collection of sites [n] = f0; 1; : : : ; n 1g, each pair i; j of which has an associated interaction energy V ij .
