Title: Fuzzy metaqueries for guiding the Discovery Process in KDD  
Author: Jesus Cerquides, Ramon Lopez de Mantaras

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of fuzzy metaqueries and describes a framework for knowledge discovery that has fuzzy metaqueries as its base. Fuzzy metaqueries are second order like fuzzy rules, very useful for the integration of inductive learning, deductive verification, human intuition and uncertainty handling.

Reference-contexts: Further information on this topic can be found in Section 10.7 of <ref> [2] </ref>. * The fuzzy concept editor allows the user to view concepts learnt by the fuzzy concept learner, modify them, delete those that he feels are not significant and define new ones that he thinks are important. * The metaquery execution module, realizes most of the work.

Reference-contexts: Also the inclusion of other characteristics of fuzzy logic as fuzzy quantifiers, hedges and qualified propositions in fuzzy metaqueries has not been studied, and its introduction can surely improve the quality of knowledge discovered by them. Strategies for metaquery suggestion are studied in <ref> [5] </ref>. A similar study must be realized for fuzzy metaqueries. 7 Acknowledgements Jesus Cerquides research is supported by a doctoral scholarship of the CIRIT (Generalitat de Catalunya).
