Abstract: PARAMICS is a PARAllel MICroscopic Traffic Simulator which is, to our knowledge, the most powerful of its type in the world. The simulator can model around 200,000 vehicles on around 7,000 roads (taken from real road traffic network data) at faster than `real-time' rates, making use of 16K processor TMC Connection Machine CM-200 for the simulation aspect. The project aims to make available to road network planners a new range of tools, and demonstrates that use of high performance computing in real applications is possible and worthwhile, while yielding important and interesting research results.

Reference-contexts: Such models are generally classed as being macroscopic simulations. Unfortunately, such models do not properly represent real traffic behaviour in congested situations, and do not reproduce the inherently fluctuating nature of real world situations. PARAMICS <ref> [1, 2] </ref> is a microscopic simulator, as we are interested in accurately modelling congestion formation and dispersion, as well as maintaining an accurate picture of what is actually happening.

Reference-contexts: However, when compared to, for example, the original microscopic simulator MICSIM <ref> [5] </ref>, which made use of a DECstation, we can observe a speedup factor of around 1,000. In a sense, this is missing the point. PARAMICS was designed to solve a very large problem, with a required per formance.

Reference-contexts: (Of course, microscopic simulators can also gather statistics on flows through roads, so these figures can be compared with results from the macroscopic simulations see x9.) 2.2 Previous Work The PARAMICS project is based on a sequential system named MICSIM (Microscopic Simulator)[5], which was developed as part of project IMAURO <ref> [6] </ref>.

PARAMICS is required to simulate around 200,000 vehicles at near real-time speeds, needing a thousand-fold increase in processing speed on the original simulator.

The timeliness of the PARAMICS project is evident from the number of other projects attempting traffic simulation using parallel computers. Examples include the TRANSIM project <ref> [7, 8] </ref>, issues of traffic control being studied using arrays of transputers [9] and the recent work published by K. Nagel et al [10, 11, 12].

Reference-contexts: The same code and program is executing in both cases, but when the simulator is also present, data can be extracted and the simulator controlled. In such a case, the simulator and visualiser communicate making use of EPCC's multi-platform message passing library, CHIMP <ref> [14] </ref>. When executing stand-alone, the visualiser can replay simulation snapshots at leisure, extracting the same types of data that were available when the data was produced.
