Reference-contexts: geometry through the use large dictionaries and extensive searches though the space of possible legal combinations, however: "...the labeling scheme examined here still has problems: syntactically nonsensical scenes [can be] coherently labeled; scenes [and be] given geo metrically impossible labels; and scenes that cannot arise from polyhedra are easily labeled." <ref> (Ballard and Brown, 1982, p. 298) </ref>. Another method, developed by Mackworth (1973), used brightness to determine surface gradients in a fashion similar to the reflectance map computations later used by Horn (1977).

Reference-contexts: This mapping rule will result in a consistent grammar which can reconstruct a subset of generalized cylinders <ref> (Binford, 1971) </ref>, in which an arbitrary two-dimensional shape (in this case a shape without lines of the third peak orientation) is swept along the direction in three space which is mapped to the third peak orientation.

Reference-contexts: By assuming a simple grammar which just uses the line orientation to determine the represented three-dimensional displacement, simple polyhedral scenes such as the fireplace mantel shown in Figure 15-2 of Robot Vision <ref> (Horn, 1986) </ref> can be interpreted without determining a consistent labeling of each line. <p> this system is quite robust to spurious and somewhat fractured lines, the clustering operation will fail completely if there are any missing lines. 14 * "The accidental alignment in which we happen to be viewing a vertex from a direction that makes it line up with a more distant edge" <ref> (Horn, 1986) </ref> will cause the recovery of only one line, which will result in failure of the clustering operation.
