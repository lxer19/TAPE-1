Reference-contexts: The extension is strongly continuous if p 2 [1; 1i and weakly fl continuous if p = 1 (see [ElR5], or <ref> [Aus] </ref> for the case G = R d ). Moreover, H and S act on the spaces L ^p = L p (G ; d^g) formed with respect to right Haar measure d^g.

Reference-contexts: If H L = P d 0 i denotes the sublaplacian then L 0 p;n = D ((I + H L ) n=2 ) for all n 2 N 0 and p 2 h1; 1i, with equivalent norms (see <ref> [BER] </ref>). Therefore we define L 0 p;fl = D ((I + H L ) fl=2 ) for all fl 2 h0; 1inN, equipped with the graph norm. We first consider operators in divergence form and then in non-divergence form. The best results are for p = 2. <p> Similar conclusions are valid on L ^p . Proof The inclusion D ((I + H) (n+2)=2 ) L 0 p;n+2 follows as in <ref> [BER] </ref>, since we have the appropriate kernel bounds (see also the proof of Theorem 4.6 in [ElR6]). Then the inclusions D ((I + H) fl=2 ) L 0 p;fl for fl 2 [0; n + 2] follow by interpolation.

Reference-contexts: The form h is closed, H is maximal accretive and it generates a strongly continuous, holomorphic, semigroup S on L 2 (see, for example, <ref> [Kat] </ref>, Chapter VI). If the principal coefficients c ij are right uniformly continuous then S extends to a holomorphic semigroup on all the spaces L p (G ; dg), p 2 [1; 1].

Reference-contexts: We use a Taylor expansion to interpolate between Gaussian bounds on the kernel and uniform bounds on its derivatives, and Holder derivatives, to deduce Gaussian bounds on the intermediate derivatives. To be more precise we need to introduce some notation. In general we adopt the notation of <ref> [Rob] </ref> and [ElR5]. First we consider second-order operators in divergence form, H = X A i c ij A j + X (c i A i + A i c 0 with complex coefficients c ij , c i , c 0 i , c 0 2 L 1 . <p> This is indeed the situation if a 1 ; : : : ; a d 0 is a vector space basis of g, i.e., if one is in the strongly elliptic case, by the discussion on pages 201-202 18 of <ref> [Rob] </ref>, but one does not have equivalence in the strictly subelliptic framework. The equiv-alence breaks down at short distances.

Reference-contexts: Next, if the coefficients are at least once differentiable then the increased regularity of the kernel follows from a repeated use of local and global properties for operators with constant coefficients. In Xu <ref> [Xu] </ref> similar local estimates were deduced but in the present situation the proofs are simplified by use of global results. <p> There are two good reasons for considering non-divergence form operators. First one has improved smoothness properties for the kernel of the semigroup generated by non-divergence form operators. Secondly, these operators allow one to exploit perturbation arguments (see <ref> [Xu] </ref>). The important ingredient is an optimal regularity result for operators with constant coefficients on Holder or Lipschitz spaces.

Reference-contexts: The analysis of [ElR6] was based on De Giorgi estimates for solutions of the local elliptic equations associated with the strongly elliptic operators. Our current starting point is an idea of Xu and Zuily <ref> [XuZ] </ref>, a particular transformation of vector fields, which allows us to establish the appropriate subelliptic estimates in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the identity for operators with Holder continuous coefficients. <p> But such functions do not exist, even locally, on a general group and for a general algebraic basis. Therefore quite different arguments are necessary. In a similar context Xu and Zuily <ref> [XuZ] </ref> circumvented this problem with an appropriately chosen transformation of vector fields. Set B 0 (r) = B 0 (e ; r) for all r &gt; 0. <p> Proof This follows from <ref> [XuZ] </ref>, Lemma 2.2 and Corollary 2.3. 2 Throughout the following R 1 , Y 1 ; : : : ; Y d 0 and T will be chosen as in Lemma 2.1.
