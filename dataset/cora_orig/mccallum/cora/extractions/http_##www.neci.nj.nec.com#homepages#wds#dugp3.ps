Abstract: The Gilbert-Pollak conjecture, posed in 1968, was the most important conjecture in the area of "Steiner trees." The "Steiner minimal tree" (SMT) of a point set P is the shortest network of "wires" which will suffice to electrically interconnect P. The "minimum spanning tree" (MST) is the shortest such network when only intersite line segments are permitted. The GP conjecture stated that was achieved when P was the vertices of a regular d-simplex. We settle this conjecture. It is true when d = 2 and false when d 3. This was previously known for d 9. Indeed, we show that any point set achieving d must have cardinality growing at least exponentially with d. The real question now is: What are the true minimal- point sets? This paper introduces the "d-dimensional sausage" point sets, which may have a lot to do with the answer.

Reference-contexts: the SMT consisted of a union of SMTs each lying inside a component simplex, a possibility which we have previously ruled out. 2 By applying Wynn's epsilon extrapolation (Wynn 1961) to g (1 : : : 14), we find that lim g (d) 0:6812 0:0001: (6) Meanwhile it is known <ref> (Chung-Gilbert 1976) </ref> that the d-simplex has a Steiner ratio which tends to C = p 2) :66984 or below, and that the 80-simplex has 0:677754.

Reference-contexts: The best Steiner tree with path-topology was found by using the well-known <ref> (Gilbert-Pollak 1968) </ref> concave-up behavior of the SMT-length as a function of Steiner (or any) point coordinates with the SMT topology held fixed, to see that there must be a unique local (and global) 3 We believe the numerical errors in g (d) are a unit last place. <p> The proofs of theorem 4 (and theorem 1, if one is careful) show (dsimplex) (dsausage) = (1=d) but cannot hope to show anything stronger. Open Question #1: is d &gt; C for all d 1? It is trivial to see <ref> (Gilbert-Pollak 1968) </ref> that in any metric space, 1=2. R.L. Graham and F.K. Hwang 1976 showed that 1= 3 0:57735 in any Euclidean space.
